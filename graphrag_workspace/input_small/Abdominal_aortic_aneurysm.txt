Abdominal aortic aneurysm Overview
Summary
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is usually asymptomatic and typically detected incidentally. In the minority
of patients who experience symptoms, abdominal, back, and groin pain are typical.
Ultrasound remains the definitive test for initial diagnosis and screening. Imaging with computed tomography
angiography or magnetic resonance angiography is used for anatomical mapping to assist with operative
planning.
For AAA detected as an incidental finding, surveillance is preferred to repair until the theoretical risk
of rupture exceeds the estimated risk of operative mortality. Repair is indicated in patients with large
asymptomatic AAA.
Mortality during elective surgical repair is higher for women than men for both open repair (7.0% vs. 5.2%)
and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) (2.1% vs. 1.3%).
Complications of treatment include acute kidney injury, limb ischemia, spinal cord ischemia, anastomotic
pseudoaneurysm, graft infection, graft limb occlusion, and distal embolization. Endoleak is a specific
complication of EVAR.
Definition
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent pathologic dilation of the aorta with a diameter >1.5 times
the expected anteroposterior (AP) diameter of that segment, given the patient's sex and body size.[1] [2] [3]
The most commonly adopted threshold is a diameter of 3 cm or more.[4] [5] [6] More than 90% of aneurysms
originate below the renal arteries.[7]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Epidemiology varies by region, age, ethnicity, and sex, with large screening studies offering the closest
approximation. A screening study of US veterans ages 50 to 79 years found the highest prevalence of AAA
(AAA >3 cm) among white male smokers (5.9%).[14] Prevalence among men is 4 to 6 times higher than
in women.[1] [15] According to data from the UK National Health Service (NHS) AAA screening program,
of the 291,904 men eligible for their initial AAA screen between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020, 76.1%
were screened by 31 March 2020 and 0.92% had an aneurysm. There were 8340 men ages over 65 who
self-referred into the UK NHS AAA screening program and 88.9% were screened by 31 March 2020; the
aneurysm detection rate in self-referred men was higher than cohort men, at 3.8%.[16] 30 patients that had
AAA detected in this screening year had a subsequent ruptured AAA; 25 of which were fatal.[16]
A systematic review of studies reporting screen-detected AAA in women found that the pooled prevalence of
AAA increased with age (>1% for women >70 years of age) and with smoking status (>1% for female ever-
smokers; >2% for current smokers).[17] The prevalence of aneurysms among men increases by about 6%
per decade of life.[13] In 2019 there were 9904 deaths attributed to AAA in the US.[18]
In the UK, deaths from AAA declined sharply from 1997 to 2009, with mortality in men ages >65 years
falling from 65.9 to 44.6 per 100,000 population.[19] Admissions for ruptured AAA fell from 18.6 to 13.5
per 100,000 in all age groups. The reduction in mortality and admissions has been attributed to the fall in
smoking prevalence and the rise in elective AAA repair in older age groups.[19] Current data from the AAA
screening program in the UK show AAA to be more common in white British (and in particular white Irish)
men than in black or Asian men.[20]
Etiology
Traditionally, arterial aneurysms were thought to arise from atherosclerotic disease, and certainly
intimal atherosclerosis reliably accompanies AAA.[21] Subsequent data suggest that altered tissue
metalloproteinases may diminish the integrity of the arterial wall.[9]
Smoking remains the most significant risk factor.[1] [5] [13] [15] [22] [23] [24][25] 
Research suggests that diabetes may protect against the growth and enlargement of AAA.[26] [27] [28]
 However, the protective mechanism is yet to be determined.[27] Data demonstrate that operative and long-
term survival is lower among AAA repair patients with diabetes than those without, suggesting an increased
cardiovascular burden.[26] [29]
Pathophysiology
Histologically there is obliteration of collagen and elastin in the media and adventitia, smooth muscle
cell loss with resulting tapering of the medial wall, infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, and
neovascularization.[21] There are four mechanisms relevant to AAA development:[30]
• Proteolytic degradation of aortic wall connective tissue: matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
other proteases are derived from macrophages and aortic smooth muscle cells and secreted
into the extracellular matrix. Disproportionate proteolytic enzyme activity in the aortic wall may
promote deterioration of structural matrix proteins (e.g., elastin and collagen).[31] One meta-analysis
reported significant AAA risk associated with the expression of certain MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-13

polymorphisms (and MMP-9 in a hospital patient subgroup), indicating possible future clinical
applications for determining prognosis and suitability of patients for surgery.[32]
• Inflammation and immune responses: an extensive transmural infiltration by macrophages and
lymphocytes is present on aneurysm histology and these cells may release a cascade of cytokines
that subsequently activate many proteases.[21] Additionally, deposition of immunoglobulin G into the
aortic wall supports the hypothesis that AAA formation may be an autoimmune response. There is
research interest in the role of reactive oxygen species and antioxidants in AAA formation.[33] [34] [35]
[36] [37]
• Biomechanical wall stress: elastin levels and the elastin-collagen ratio decrease progressively distal
down the aorta. Diminished elastin is associated with aortic dilation, and collagen degradation
predisposes to rupture.[30] Additionally, data support increased MMP-9 expression and activity,
disordered flow and an increase in wall tension, and relative tissue hypoxia in the distal aorta (i.e.,
infrarenal).[33] [38] [39]
• Molecular genetics: AAA exhibits significant heritability (the proportion of phenotype due to genotype).
A Swedish Twin Registry study found that the twin of a monozygotic twin with AAA had a risk of AAA
approximately 70 times greater than that of the twin of a monozygotic twin without AAA.[40] While
there is no single genetic defect or polymorphism responsible, familial clustering suggests a polygenic
etiology. Genome-wide approaches have identified 10 risk loci for AAA, 4 of which are not shared with
other cardiovascular diseases.[41] [42]
Classification
Types of AAA[8] [9]
• Congenital: while medial degeneration occurs naturally with age, it is accelerated in patients with
bicuspid aortic valves and Marfan syndrome.
• Infectious: infection of the aortic wall ("mycotic aneurysm" of "infectious aortitis") is a rare etiology. 
Staphylococcus ,  Pneumococcus ,    Escherichia coli , and  Salmonella  are the most common
pathogens.[3] [5]  Chlamydia pneumoniae  has been postulated as an infectious etiology for
conventional aneurysms.[10] Tertiary syphilis may manifest as aortic aneurysm, but this is an
exceptionally rare presentation.[5] [11] Fungal infection and tuberculous aortitis are rare and most
often occur in the setting of immunocompromise.[5] 
• Inflammatory: the etiology of inflammatory AAAs remains controversial. This variant is characterized
by an abnormal accumulation of macrophages and cytokines in diseased tissue. Pathologically there
is perianeurysmal fibrosis, thickened walls, and dense adhesions.[9] The most common causes
of inflammatory aortitis are the large vessel vasculitides Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis.
Other known causes include immunoglobulin G4-related disease, sarcoidosis, Behcet disease and
granulomatosis with polyangiitis.[5]
Case history
Case history #1
A 65-year-old man presents to his local aneurysm surveillance team for a screening ultrasound scan.
He has been feeling well and in his usual state of good health. His medical history is notable for mild
hypertension and he has a 100-pack-year tobacco history. On ultrasound an infrarenal AAA is identified.

THEORY
Case history #2
A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension (well controlled with medication) and tobacco use
presents to his primary care physician with a 2-day history of constant and gnawing hypogastric pain.
The pain has been steadily worsening in intensity. He says the pain radiates to his lower back and both
groins at times. While he cannot identify any aggravating factors (such as movement), he feels the pain
improves with his knees flexed. There is a palpable pulsatile mass just left of midline below the umbilicus.
He is immediately referred for definitive management, but during transfer becomes hypotensive and
unresponsive.
Other presentations
The triad of abdominal pain, weight loss, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggests
inflammatory AAA.[9] A tender, palpable pulsatile mass on examination and elevated C-reactive protein
may also be present.[3] Abdominal or back pain with fever is suggestive of infectious AAA.[3] Typically
there is history of arterial trauma, intravenous drug abuse, local or concurrent infection, bacterial
endocarditis. or impaired immunity. Osteomyelitis of the thoracic or lumbar spine may develop. Anemia,
leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures are common.[12] Diagnosis may be aided by complications
of unruptured aneurysms, including distal embolization, acute thrombosis, or symptoms caused by
ureterohydronephrosis.[3] [13]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Diagnosis
Approach
Patients most commonly lack any symptoms and their aneurysm is noted on physical examination or imaging
studies performed for other reasons.
History
In the minority of patients who experience symptoms, abdominal, back, and groin pain are typical.
Medical history is directed toward risk factors:
• Development (i.e., hyperlipidemia, connective tissue disorder, COPD, and hypertension)[1] [5] [13]
[15] [22] [58] [59] [64] [71]
• Expansion (i.e., previous cardiac or renal transplant, previous stroke, advanced age [>70 years],
and severe cardiac disease)[72] [73] [74]
• Rupture (i.e., female sex, previous cardiac or renal transplant, hypertension).[13] [54] [55] [74][75]
[76]
A history of cigarette smoking increases a patient's risk of AAA development, expansion, and rupture.[5]
[13] [22] [23] [43] [76] In men who have never smoked, important risk factors for AAA include older age
and a first-degree relative with AAA.[3] [4]
A history of previous abdominal surgery or previous endovascular aortic aneurysm repair can be elicited
as well as family history of AAA.
Physical examination
The abdomen can be palpated for a pulsatile abdominal mass and abdominal tenderness. Physical exam
should include an assessment for peripheral artery aneurysm (femoral and popliteal).[77]
Aneurysm palpation on clinical examination has only been shown to be sensitive in thin patients and
those with AAA >5 cm, with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 68% and 75%, respectively.[1] [78]
Detection rates are affected by aortic diameter, clinician experience, and body habitus of the patient.[3]
The sensitivity of abdominal palpation for detecting AAA decreases in patients with an abdominal girth
more than 100 cm.[78]
The classic triad of a pulsatile abdominal mass with hypotension and abdominal and/or back pain is
present in about 50% of patients with a ruptured AAA.[3]
The presence of fever may increase suspicion for infectious AAA in the appropriate clinical setting.
Key tests
Suspected ruptured or symptomatic AAA is a medical emergency; immediate review from a vascular
surgeon is required. See Management approach . Urgent imaging with bedside aortic ultrasound is
needed to confirm the diagnosis; however, clinical diagnosis and management of a ruptured AAA should
not be delayed while waiting for the results of imaging.[77] [79]
The ultrasound is performed perpendicular to the aortic axis as oblique views may overestimate the true
aortic diameter.[2][5] [80] Unfortunately, ultrasound offers little utility in imaging aneurysms close to the
origins of, or proximal to, the renal arteries.[81] [82] In selected patients, CT scan is recommended as a
first-line investigation to evaluate patients thought to have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or
back pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric mass or significant risk factors for AAA.[77]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Other investigations
Once the diagnosis is made, further imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA) is used to
exclude rupture and for anatomic mapping to assist with operative planning (open or endovascular).[79]
[80] [83]
Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein support a diagnosis of possible
inflammatory AAA.[5]
Leukocytosis and a relative anemia on complete blood count with positive blood cultures are indicative of
infectious AAA.[12]
Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is used for the diagnosis and follow-up
of aortic pathologies associated with inflammatory aneurysm, aortic infection (including mycotic AAAs),
infected prostheses, and stent grafts.[3] [84]
Predictors of rupture risk include AAA expansion rate, increase in intraluminal thrombus thickness, wall
stiffness, wall tension, and peak AAA wall stress.[10] [77] [85]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
palpable pulsatile abdominal mass (uncommon)
• Aneurysm palpation on clinical examination has been shown to be sensitive only in thin patients and
those with AAA >5 cm (sensitivity and specificity of 68% and 75%, respectively).[1] [78] Detection rates
are affected by aortic diameter, clinician experience, and body habitus of the patient.[3] The sensitivity
of abdominal palpation for detecting AAA decreases in patients with an abdominal girth more than 100
cm.[78]
Other diagnostic factors
abdominal, back, or groin pain (uncommon)
• The classic triad of abdominal and/or back pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass
is present in about 50% of patients with a ruptured AAA.[3] However, the majority of patients are
asymptomatic and their aneurysm is detected incidentally.[80]
hypotension (uncommon)
• Patients with ruptured aneurysm present with cardiovascular collapse.[79]
Risk factors
Strong
cigarette smoking
• This is the risk factor most strongly associated with AAA.[13] [15] [22] [23] [24] [25]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Diagnosis
• Active cigarette smoking is independently associated with histologic high-grade tissue
inflammation.[43]
• The duration of smoking is significantly associated with an increased risk in a linear dose-response
relationship.[24] Each year of smoking increases the relative risk by 4%.[23]
hereditary/family history
• Studies support a familial aggregation of and genetic predisposition to AAA.[13] [25][44][45] [46] [47]
[48] [49] [50] [51]
• In a large population-based study, a positive first-degree family history for AAA was more common
among cases than among controls (8.4% vs. 4.6%, P=0.0001).[52] The risk of AAA associated with
family history was approximately doubled compared with no family history (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% CI
1.6 to 2.2).
• A Swedish twin registry study found that the twin of a monozygotic twin with AAA had a risk of AAA
approximately 70 times greater than that of the twin of a monozygotic twin without AAA.[40]
increased age
• Prevalence increases with age.[1] [5][15]
• Most frequently diagnosed in men >55 years of age, and rupture rarely occurs before 65 years of
age.[3]
• AAA is typically discovered approximately 10 years later in women.[13] [53]
male sex (prevalence)
• AAAs are 4 to 6 times more prevalent in men than women.[13] [15] [25]
female sex (rupture)
• Risk of rupture is greater in women than in men.[54] [55]
congenital/connective tissue disorders
• Aortic degeneration is accelerated in patients with Marfan syndrome, and during pregnancy.[56] [57]
[58]
• Marfan syndrome specifically is associated with cystic medial necrosis of the aorta secondary to an
autosomal dominant anomaly in fibrillin type 1, a structural protein that directs and orients elastin in
the developing aorta.[56] [57] As a result, the mature aorta demonstrates abnormal elastic properties,
progressive stiffening, and dilation.[58]
Weak
hyperlipidemia
• Lipoproteins are elevated in patients with AAA independent of cardiovascular risk factors and extent of
atherosclerosis.[59] Patients with AAA have a high incidence of genetically determined dyslipidemia.
[60]
• AAA patients have significantly lower levels of apolipoprotein AI and HDL cholesterol than matched
controls with aorto-iliac occlusive disease.[59]
• High serum total cholesterol is a relatively weak risk factor for AAA, whereas high HDL cholesterol
was strongly associated with a low risk of AAA.[15] Statin therapy may reduce AAA growth rates and
mortality.[61] [62] [63]

DIAGNOSIS
COPD
• This is attributed to tobacco-induced elastin degradation.[13]
• Studies suggest that the association between reduced respiratory function and AAA may be due to the
activation of inflammation and hemostasis in response to injury.[64]
atherosclerosis (i.e., coronary artery disease [CAD], peripheral arterial
occlusive disease)
• CAD is an independent risk factor.[1] [22]
hypertension
• Hypertension is a weak independent risk factor.[13] [15] [65]
• There is a relation between systolic blood pressure and AAA in women, and an association with ever-
use antihypertensive medication and AAA risk for both sexes.[15]
central obesity
• One study of >12,000 men demonstrated an independent association between central obesity and
AAA.[66]
nondiabetic
• Research suggests that diabetes protects against the growth and enlargement of AAA.[26] [27] [28]
 However, the protective mechanism is yet to be determined.[27] [28] Operative and long-term survival
was lower among AAA repair patients with diabetes than those without, suggesting an increased
cardiovascular burden.[26]
fluoroquinolone antibiotic#use
• Studies suggest an association between use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and a small increase in risk
of AAA.[67] [68] [69] However, having a small AAA is not a contraindication to using fluoroquinolone
antibiotics.[3]
aneurysms elsewhere in the body
• Co-prevalence of aneurysms is common; one in six patients with a primary aneurysm also has another
aneurysm elsewhere. Screening for AAA in patients with intracranial aneurysms may be clinically
indicated and cost-effective.[70]
Tests

Screening
Ultrasonography is the most widely used screening and surveillance imaging method for the evaluation of
AAA.[6] Ultrasonography is safe, portable, easy to operate, and proven beneficial for screening of AAA,
with high sensitivity and specificity and a high accuracy comparable to computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, or magnetic resonance angiography.[6][94]
Screening 65-year-old men for AAA significantly reduces AAA-specific mortality.[95] [96] [97]
US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations include:[4] [5] 
• One-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked
• Selective screening (based on an assessment of risk factors, including older age and a first-degree
relative with a AAA) for AAA in men ages 65 to 75 years who have never smoked.
There is insufficient evidence for benefit of one-time AAA population screening for women.[4][98] [99] The
USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for AAA in women ages 65 to 75
years who have never smoked and have no family history of AAA outweigh the benefits.[4] The USPSTF
maintains that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for
AAA in women ages 65 to 75 years with risk factors for AAA (ever smoked or with a family history of AAA).[4]
 However, this patient group is included in the screening guidelines from the Canadian Society for Vascular
Surgery, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend that
screening of female smokers is cost effective.[5] [100]
Some data suggest that the USPSTF screening criteria detect fewer than one third of patients who ultimately
undergo surgical repair of AAA; two groups at particular risk of AAA requiring surgical intervention but who
are currently excluded from the screening guidelines include people under the age of 65 who smoke and
those over 70 who have never smoked.[101] It has been postulated, therefore, that expanding the screening
criteria for AAA may be reasonable and justified.[102]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
Approach
Patients presenting with a ruptured aneurysm require emergent repair.
For patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysms, repair is indicated regardless of diameter.[5] [79] [104]
For asymptomatic AAA detected as an incidental finding, surveillance is preferred to repair until the
theoretical risk of rupture exceeds the estimated risk of operative mortality. Generally, repair is indicated in
patients with large asymptomatic AAA (e.g., with a diameter exceeding 5.5 cm in men or 5.0 cm in women in
the US, although treatment decisions based on greater size may differ in other countries).[1] [5][77] [79][105]
[106] [107] [108]
Repair of asymptomatic, symptomatic, and ruptured aneurysms can be accomplished using either an
endovascular or open surgical technique; the selection of surgical technique should take account of patient
preference, patient age, sex, perioperative risk factors, and anatomic factors. A shared decision making
approach taking into account the risks and benefits of the procedures is recommended.[5]
Ruptured AAA
Patients with the triad of abdominal and/or back pain, pulsatile abdominal mass, and hypotension warrant
immediate resuscitation and surgical evaluation as repair offers the only potential cure.[77] [109] However,
most patients with rupture will not survive to reach the operating suite.

reflecting the Departments of Vascular Surgery and Radiology
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend computed
tomography (CT) imaging in patients presenting with ruptured AAA who are hemodynamically stable to
evaluate whether the AAA is amenable to endovascular repair.[5] This recommendation is supported by
results from the IMPROVE multicenter randomized controlled trial, which suggest that for most patients,
confirmatory CT did not add significant delays to treatment and facilitated appropriate preoperative
planning.[110]
If the anatomy is suitable, the ACC/AHA recommend endovascular repair over open repair to reduce the
risk of morbidity and mortality.[5]
• In patients with confirmed ruptured AAA, 3-year mortality was lower among those randomized to
endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) than to an open repair strategy (48% vs. 56%; hazard ratio
[HR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.90).[111]

• The difference between treatment groups was no longer evident after 7 years of follow-up (HR
0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.13). Re-intervention rates were not significantly different between the
randomized groups at 3 years (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32).[111]
• There is some evidence to suggest that an endovascular strategy for repair of ruptured AAA may
reduce mortality more effectively in women than in men.[111] [112]
There is some evidence to suggest that mode of anesthesia for operative repair of AAA affects
outcomes.[5] [113] In 2024, the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) issued a weak
recommendation favoring local anesthesia over general anesthesia in elective settings, based on potential
reduction in procedure time, ICU admissions, and postoperative hospital stay.[3] [114] [115] [116]
• The IMPROVE (Immediate Management of Patients with Rupture: Open Versus Endovascular
Repair) multicenter randomized controlled trial detected a significantly reduced 30-day mortality in
patients who had EVAR under local anesthesia alone compared with general anesthesia (adjusted
OR 0.27, 0.1 to 0.7).[110]
• A separate meta-analysis comparing mode of anesthesia for endovascular repair of ruptured
AAA replicated these findings or improved outcomes with EVAR under local anesthesia.[117]
 However, another systematic review did not show any mortality benefit with local anesthesia, but
did demonstrate shorter hospital stays.[118]
• Data from the UK’s National Vascular Registry (9783 patients who received an elective, standard
infrarenal EVAR; general anesthetic, n = 7069; regional anesthetic, n = 2347; local anesthetic, n =
367) showed a lower 30 day mortality rate after regional versus general anesthesia.[119]
• The international multicenter Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global Post-Market Registry
(ENGAGE) study examined the outcomes of 1231 patients undergoing EVAR under general
(62% of patients), regional (27%), and local (11%) anesthesia.[120] The type of anesthesia had
no influence on perioperative mortality or morbidity but the use of local or regional anesthesia
during EVAR appeared to be beneficial in decreasing procedure time, need for ICU admission, and
duration of postoperative hospital stay.[120]
Supportive treatment of ruptured AAA
Standard resuscitation measures should be initiated immediately. These include:
• Airway management (supplemental oxygen or endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation if
the patient is unconscious).
• Intravenous access (central venous catheter).
• Arterial catheter; urinary catheter.
• Hypotensive resuscitation: aggressive fluid replacement may cause dilutional and hypothermic
coagulopathy and secondary clot disruption from increased blood flow, increased perfusion
pressure, and decreased blood viscosity, thereby exacerbating bleeding.[121][122] A target systolic
blood pressure (SBP) of 50 to 70 mmHg and withholding fluids is advocated preoperatively.[121]
[122] The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend permissive hypotension to reduce bleeding.[5]
 However, recommended targets vary and there is no consensus among global guideline groups.
• The IMPROVE multicenter randomized controlled trial found that lowest SBP was
significantly and independently associated with 30-day mortality in patients with ruptured
AAA, and that a target SBP below 70 mmHg in older patients may have contributed to worse
outcomes.[110] In people with ruptured AAA with a recorded preoperative SBP less than 70
mmHg, mortality at 30 days was higher (51.0%) compared with those with SBP above 70
mmHg (34.1%).[110]

• One Cochrane review of controlled (permissive) hypotension versus normotensive
resuscitative strategy for people with ruptured AAA, which included the IMPROVE trial,
noted that people with ruptured AAA are usually older and more likely to have coronary and
renal atherosclerotic disease. These patients are also at greater risk of myocardial infarction
and renal insufficiency if submitted to low SBP levels compared with younger people with
trauma.[123]
• Blood product (packed red cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma) availability and transfusion for
resuscitation, severe anemia, and coagulopathy.
• Notifying anesthetic, intensive care unit (ICU), and operating teams.
Symptomatic but not ruptured AAA
In patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysm, urgent repair is indicated regardless of diameter.[5] [79]
[103] [104] The development of new or worsening pain may herald aneurysm expansion and impending
rupture. Symptomatic, nonruptured aneurysm is, therefore, best treated urgently.[77] Under some
circumstances, intervention may be delayed for several hours to optimize conditions to ensure successful
repair; these patients should be closely monitored in the ICU.[77]
EVAR is increasingly used in the management of patients with symptomatic AAA.[127] [128] In
observational studies, short-term all-cause mortality rates did not differ between endovascular and open
repair of symptomatic AAA.[127] [128] [129]
Data from the 2011-2013 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
suggest that 30-day mortality risk after repair of symptomatic AAA was approximately double that
following asymptomatic AAA repair, regardless of surgical approach (EVAR: symptomatic 3.8% vs.
asymptomatic 1.4%, P=0.001; open surgery: symptomatic 7.7% vs. asymptomatic 4.3%, P=0.08).[130]
Smaller patient numbers likely contribute to the non-statistically significant finding reported for open repair.
Incidental finding of small asymptomatic AAA
For AAA detected as an incidental finding, surveillance is preferred to repair until the theoretical risk of
rupture exceeds the estimated risk of operative mortality.[4] Early surgery for the treatment of smaller
AAAs does not reduce all-cause or AAA-specific mortality.[4] [131] One systematic review (4 trials,
3314 participants) found high-quality evidence to demonstrate that immediate repair of small AAA (4 cm
to 5.5 cm) did not improve long-term survival compared with surveillance (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI
0.75 to 1.02, mean follow-up 10 years).[131] The lack of benefit attributable to immediate surgery was
consistent regardless of patient age, diameter of small aneurysm, and whether repair was endovascular
or open.[131]
Surgical referral of smaller AAA is usually reserved for rapid growth, or once the threshold diameter for
aneurysm repair is reached on repeated ultrasonography.[4]
However, in patients with an underlying genetic cause or connective tissue disorder, the threshold
diameter for considering repair should be individualized, depending on:[3]
• Anatomic features
• Underlying genetics: rupture risk is higher at smaller aortic diameters in some conditions, and
surgical repair is more challenging in certain disorders owing to the increased arterial wall fragility
and anatomy[3]
Medical goals for asymptomatic small aneurysms include:

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
1. Surveillance:
• American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines recommend
that infra-/juxtarenal AAAs measuring 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter by ultrasound/CT should be
monitored every 6-12 months.[5] Once larger than 4.5 cm in women and 5 cm in men, these
guidelines recommend surveillance every 6 months.[5] AAAs <3.9 cm can be monitored with
ultrasound every 2-3 years.[5]
• The UK National Health Service recommends that annual screening intervals are employed for 3.0
to 4.4 cm AAAs and 3-month intervals for 4.5 to 5.4 cm AAAs.[132]
• One systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data concluded that surveillance
intervals of 2 years for 3.0 to 4.4 cm AAA, and 6 months for 4.5 to 5.4 cm AAA, are safe and cost-
effective.[133]
• Analysis of AAA growth and rupture rates indicated that in order to maintain a AAA rupture risk
<1%, an 8.5-year surveillance interval is required for men with baseline AAA diameter of 3.0
cm.[133] The corresponding estimated surveillance interval for men with an initial aneurysm
diameter of 5.0 cm was 17 months. Despite having similar small aneurysm growth rates, rupture
rates were four times higher in women than in men.[133] Surveillance programs and criteria for
considering surgery need to be tailored for women with opportunistically detected AAA.
• Most AAAs show linear growth; modeling based on this suggests that smaller AAAs (<4.25 cm)
could be followed up every 2 years, with minimal chance of exceeding interventional thresholds
within that time.[134] [135]
• Aneurysmal growth of ≥0.5 cm in 6 months may be an indication for repair, to reduce the risk of
rupture.[5]
• The ESVS recommends incorporation of subaneurysmal aortas (2.5 to 2.9 cm) into AAA
surveillance recommendations since long-term cohort studies show that most subaneurysmal
aortas eventually progress to an AAA of which a substantial proportion will reach the diameter
threshold for consideration of repair.[3] Surveillance decisions should take into account life
expectancy, suitability for future repair, and patient preferences.[3]
2. Control of modifiable risk factors for expansion and rupture:
• Smoking cessation - nicotine-replacement therapy, nortriptyline, and bupropion, or counseling.[1]
[5] [13] [15] [22] [23] [136] [137] [138]
• Short-term treatment with beta-blockers does not appear to reduce the rate of AAA expansion.[4]
[139] Trials in which patients with small AAAs were randomized to propranolol, and other beta-
blockers, with the intention of reducing the rate of aneurysm expansion failed to demonstrate
significant protective effects.[139] [140] Propranolol was poorly tolerated in these studies.[140]
3. Aggressive management of other cardiovascular disease:
• Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be
treated.[5] [79] Statins should be started at least 1 month before surgery to reduce cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality, and continued indefinitely.[3][141]
• There is limited evidence, but in the absence of any contraindication, patients with AAA should
receive single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel).[3] [5] [142]

differ in other countries).[5] Repair of aneurysms ≥5.5 cm offers a survival advantage.[1][77] [79][104]
[106] [107] [108]
Decisions regarding repair should be individualized, taking account of patient preference, patient age,
sex, perioperative risk factors, and anatomic risk factors. Care should be taken to evaluate patient
quality of life, and careful counseling undertaken regarding the risks of surgery (e.g., informing patients
of their Vascular Quality Initiative perioperative mortality risk score) and subsequent quality of life.
A shared decision making approach taking into account the risks and benefits of the procedures is
recommended.[5] EVAR should be considered in patients who are unfit for open surgery.[5][77] [79][131]
Data suggest that in patients with large AAAs (ranging from 5.0 to 5.5 cm) undergoing elective repair,
EVAR is equivalent to open repair in terms of overall survival, although the rate of secondary interventions
is higher for EVAR.[143] [144] EVAR reduces AAA-related mortality (but not longer-term overall survival)
in patients with large AAA (≥5.5 cm) who are unsuitable for open repair.[145] Post-repair, larger AAAs
appear to be associated with worse late survival than smaller aneurysms (pooled HR 1.14 per 1-cm
increase in AAA diameter, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.18; 12.0- to 91.2-month follow-up).[146] The association is
more pronounced with EVAR than with open repair.
Elective repair in asymptomatic patients allows for preoperative assessment, cardiac risk stratification,
and medical optimization of other comorbidities. Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of
early and late mortality after AAA repair.
Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)
EVAR involves the transfemoral endoluminal delivery of a covered stent graft into the aorta, thus sealing
off the aneurysm wall from systemic pressures, preventing rupture, and allowing for sac shrinkage. The
endograft can be deployed percutaneously through low-profile devices, or after exposing the femoral
arteries surgically. A Cochrane review found no difference between the techniques after short follow-up (6
months), except that the percutaneous approach may be faster.[147]  Long-term data for the durability of
low-profile devices are lacking.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)
University of Michigan/Dr G.R. Upchurch, Departments of Vascular Surgery and Radiology
Assessment of suitability for EVAR should be through the use of 0.5 mm-slice CT angiography.[80] It is
essential that the operator is familiar with the specific instructions for use of the endograft to be used.
Lifelong, annual surveillance with ultrasonography or CT is recommended following endovascular repair
of AAAs to detect late complications and identify late device failure and disease progression.[3] [77]
Open repair
Open repair may be transperitoneal or retroperitoneal. With proximal and distal aortic control obtained,
the aneurysm is opened, back-bleeding branch arteries are ligated, and a prosthetic graft is sutured from
normal proximal aorta to normal distal aorta (or iliac segments). Once flow is restored to the bilateral iliac
arteries, the aneurysm sac is closed over the graft.[148] A retroperitoneal approach should be considered
for patients with aneurysmal disease that extends to the juxtarenal and/or visceral aortic segment, or in
the presence of an inflammatory aneurysm, horseshoe kidney, or hostile abdomen.[77][149]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
MANAGEMENT
Straight tube grafts are recommended for repair in the absence of significant disease of the iliac
arteries.[77] The proximal aortic anastomosis should be performed as close to the renal arteries as
possible.[77] It is recommended that all portions of an aortic graft should be excluded from direct contact
with the intestinal contents of the peritoneal cavity.[77] Re-implantation of a patent inferior mesenteric
artery (IMA) should be considered under circumstances that suggest an increased risk of colonic
ischemia (i.e., associated celiac or superior mesenteric artery occlusive disease, an enlarged meandering
mesenteric artery, a history of prior colon resection, inability to preserve hypogastric perfusion, substantial
blood loss or intraoperative hypotension, poor IMA backbleeding when graft open, poor Doppler flow in
colonic vessels, or should the colon appear ischemic).[77] [150]
Fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR) and branched endografts (bEVAR)
For patients with a complex AAA and standard surgical risk, open or EVAR should be considered based
on fitness, anatomy, and patient preference. For patients with a complex AAA and high surgical risk,
EVAR with fenestrated and branched technologies should be considered as first-line therapy. Fenestrated
and branched endografts have become the treatment of choice of complex AAAs in most high volume
centers.[3] These procedures are viable alternatives to open repair for juxtarenal and suprarenal AAA,
or for those with AAA where a short or diseased neck precludes conventional repair.[3] [151] FEVAR
endografts have holes that correspond to the position of branching arteries within the aorta, and permit
endovascular repair of complex aneurysms. One pooled analysis of 7 retrospective studies (including
772 patients) suggested favorable mortality and target visceral vessel patency rates of 8.0% and 95.4%
at 1 year, respectively.[152] However, other meta-analyses looking at FEVAR for complex aneurysms
and juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (including 7061 patients and 2974 patients respectively)
suggest no mortality difference with FEVAR, but a potential increased re-intervention hazard.[153] [154]
 The procedure is performed routinely in some centers.[152] [153] [155] Branched devices either with
inner or outer branches involve more extended aortic coverage compared with fenestrated devices.[3] The
ESVS states these should be reserved for type 4 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (these involve entire
abdominal aorta from the level of the diaphragm to the aortic bifurcation).[3]
Choice of elective repair
EVAR accounts for more than 70% of all AAA repairs in the US.[156] In the UK, 61% of elective
infrarenal AAAs and 89% of complex AAAs were treated with EVAR during 2018-2020.[157] However,
not all patients are suitable candidates for EVAR. Guidelines therefore recommend an individualized
approach to surgical choice.[5][77] [79][158] Factors that will influence the decision include: anatomic
determinants (e.g., aneurysm diameter, neck length, neck diameter); life expectancy, sex, comorbidities;
and perioperative risk.[159] [160] A shared decision making approach taking into account the risks and
benefits of the procedures is recommended.[5]
EVAR may be preferred in patients who:
• Have high perioperative risk, and
• Have anatomy that is congruent with the relevant stent-graft manufacturer's eligibility criteria as
determined in the instructions for use, and
• Are able to satisfy the mandatory surveillance regimen following surgery.
Patients with lower perioperative risk and favorable anatomy may nonetheless also be candidates for
EVAR, but consideration should be given to safety and durability of repair (need for re-intervention), and
open repair may be preferred in patients who are relatively younger.[161] [162]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
Elective repair outcomes
Data regarding the comparative safety and efficacy of EVAR and open repair differ depending on the
outcome of interest. Evidence to date suggests that:
• Short-term all-cause postoperative mortality (≤30 days) is lower for endovascular than open repair
• Long-term (5-10 year) survival is similar among patients who underwent EVAR versus open
repair[144] [163][164]
• Operative, perioperative, and postoperative mortality (≤30 days) is greater among women than men
for both open repair and EVAR[165] [166]
• Overall rates of re-intervention are more common following EVAR than open repair.[167] [168] [169]
Six-month postoperative mortality appears to be lower among patients with AAA who undergo EVAR than
those who have open surgery, but this is primarily attributable to lower 30-day operative mortality.[170]
Pooled analysis of data from four high-quality randomized trials (that enrolled patients with AAA diameter
>5 cm) found that short-term mortality (30-day or in-hospital mortality) was significantly lower among
those randomized to EVAR than among those who underwent open repair (1.4% vs. 4.2%, odds ratio
[OR] 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; P <0.0001).[171] However, the early benefit of EVAR is diminished with
follow-up.[170] [171] [172] Open repair was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality than
EVAR, after more than 8 years of follow-up, in data from the UK endovascular aneurysm repair trial 1
(46% vs. 53%, P=0.048) and a further meta-analysis.[173] [174] One meta-analysis identified a survival
curve crossover point at 1.8 years post repair, whereafter patients undergoing EVAR had lower survival
compared with those undergoing open repair.[175]
The same trend is seen in aneurysm-related mortality. One meta-analysis found 3-year aneurysm-related
mortality to be significantly higher following EVAR repair than after open repair (pooled hazard ratio
[HR] 5.16, 95% CI 1.49 to 17.89; P=0.010).[170] Data from the UK endovascular aneurysm repair trial
1 indicate that, after more than 8 years of follow-up, aneurysm-related mortality is greater among EVAR
patients than open repair patients (5% vs. 1%, P=0.0064).[173] Aneurysm rupture was more common in
patients after EVAR than open repair (5.4% vs. 1.4%, P <0.001) in a large cohort study with 8 years of
follow-up.[176] Another systematic review that included more than 30,000 patients in 22 observational
studies found no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality with EVAR compared with open
repair.[177]
Extenuating factors have been proposed to account for the worse late-phase mortality reported in EVAR
patients compared with those who undergo open repair. One systematic review concluded that long-
term postoperative survival in patients undergoing EVAR had improved in trials published after 2005, and
attributed this to a possible improvement in EVAR techniques and perioperative care.[178]
Perioperative and short-term mortality is higher among women than among men.[165] [166] During
elective AAA repair, operative mortality among women exceeds that of men for both open (7.0% vs.
5.2%) and endovascular approaches (2.1% vs. 1.3%).[179] In the UK, women undergoing elective AAA
repair were found to have increased short-term mortality compared with men for open repair (30-day
mortality: OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.25 to 1.56) and EVAR (30-day mortality: OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.00),
despite having fewer preoperative cardiovascular risk factors.[180] Female sex was an independent risk
factor for all-cause mortality among women who had an open repair at 1 year (crude cumulative all-cause
mortality 15.9% vs. 12.1%, P <0.001) and at 5 years (22.2% vs. 19.6%, P <0.001).[180] Long-term all-
cause survival did not differ significantly between women and men in the EVAR group (P=0.356). One
review concluded that the morphological criteria for diagnosing aneurysms and offering EVAR did not take

sex-related variations in aortic size into account: women are less likely to be offered intervention because
they have smaller aortas.[181]
Overall rates of re-intervention are higher with EVAR than with open surgery; however, rates have been
reported heterogeneously in clinical trials.[167] [168] [170] [171] In pooled analysis of individual-patient
data, re-intervention was reported in 65.8% of EVAR patients with type I endoleak (79 of 120) and 22.8%
of EVAR patients with type II endoleak (99 of 435) over 5 years of follow-up.[170] Observational data
suggest that interventions related to the management of aneurysm or its complications are more common
following EVAR than open surgery (18.8% vs. 3.7%, P <0.001) over 8 years of follow-up.[176]
Meta-analysis found no significant difference between EVAR and open surgery in the incidence of
myocardial death (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; P=0.36), fatal stroke (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55;
P=0.52), or nonfatal stroke (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.31; P=0.39).[171] Patients with moderate renal
dysfunction or cardiovascular disease do not appear to derive an early survival benefit (to 6 months) from
EVAR, while those with peripheral arterial disease may benefit from open repair.[170] In another meta-
analysis, long-term survival following elective AAA repair (EVAR or open) was worst among patients with
end-stage renal disease (HR 3.15, 95% CI 2.45 to 4.04) and COPD requiring supplementary oxygen (HR
3.05, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.80).[182]
Low-quality evidence from four small randomized controlled trials suggests that elective open repair
performed retroperitoneally can reduce blood loss and hospital stay compared with a transperitoneal
approach.[183] However, there was no difference in mortality between retroperitoneal and transperitoneal
elective open AAA repair (very low-quality evidence). Moreover, the retroperitoneal approach may
increase the risk of hematoma, chronic wound pain, and abdominal wall hernia compared with
transperitoneal.[183]
Adverse effects
Complications of EVAR may include endoleak, graft occlusion, and graft migration with aortic neck
expansion. A systematic review reported aortic neck dilation in 24.6% of EVARs (9439 men included),
which led to higher rates of type I endoleak, graft migration, and re-intervention.[184] Such complications
are typically detected on completion angiography or postoperative imaging, though studies suggest that
intraoperative CT angiography may be a more sensitive method of detecting complications of EVAR.[185]
As an adjunct to EVAR, either unilateral or bilateral internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion may be acceptable
in certain anatomic situations for patients at high risk for open surgical repair. Buttock claudication will
occur in 27.9% of patients following IIA occlusion, although this resolves in 48% of cases after an average
of 21.8 months. It is less likely to occur following unilateral occlusion (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91).
Erectile dysfunction occurred in 10% to 14% of men following IIA occlusion.[77] [186]
IIA revascularization techniques, involving specialized iliac branch devices, have high technical success
rates (up to 97.5%) and are associated with low morbidity (e.g., buttock claudication rate of 2.15% to
4.1%).[187] The effects of IIA occlusion versus IIA revascularization have not been well compared.[188]
In patients with synchronous intra-abdominal malignancy, EVAR reduces mortality and delay between the
treatment of the two pathologies despite a significant risk for thrombotic events.[189] [190]
Complications of open repair include cardiac and pulmonary events, mesenteric ischemia, renal failure,
bleeding, wound and graft infection, spinal cord ischemia/paraplegia, embolization/limb ischemia, and late
graft complications (i.e., aorto-enteric fistula and aortic pseudoaneurysm).[1] [191]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
Perioperative management
Treatment of co-existing cardiac disease:
• Cardiovascular risk prevention should be prioritized in patients in AAA screening programs.[79]
[192]
• Noninvasive stress testing should be considered for patients with a history of three or more clinical
risk factors (i.e., coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes mellitus,
chronic renal insufficiency) and an unknown or poor functional capacity (MET <4) if it will change
management.[77] 
• Coronary revascularization is indicated for those patients who present with acute ST elevation
myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or stable angina with left main coronary artery or three-
vessel disease, as well as those patients with two-vessel disease that includes the proximal left
anterior descending artery and either ischemia on noninvasive testing or an ejection fraction
<0.5.[77]
Regarding blood transfusion:[77]
• Preoperative autologous blood donation may be beneficial for patients undergoing open aneurysm
repair.
• Cell salvage or an ultrafiltration device is recommended if large blood loss is anticipated or the risk
of disease transmission from banked blood is considered high.
• Blood transfusion is recommended if the intraoperative hemoglobin level is <10 g/dL in the
presence of ongoing blood loss. Consider use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in a ratio with
packed blood cells of 1:1:1.[3] [77] [193]
Pulmonary artery catheters should not be used routinely in aortic surgery, unless there is a high risk for a
major hemodynamic disturbance.[77] Central venous access is recommended for all patients undergoing
open aneurysm repair.[77] Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis consisting of intermittent pneumatic
compression and early ambulation is recommended for all patients undergoing open repair or EVAR.[77]
[194]
Avoiding hypothermia during open repair and EVAR can reduce hospital length of stay, length of stay in
the ICU, and rates of organ dysfunction.[195]
Preoperative cardiovascular risk reduction:
• Addressing modifiable cardiovascular risk factors preoperatively improves long-term survival after
AAA repair.[196]
• Preoperative exercise training reduced postsurgical cardiac complications in a small randomized
controlled trial of patients undergoing open or endovascular AAA repair, though a Cochrane review
and a separate systematic review of prehabilitation (exercise training) prior to AAA surgery did not
show any outcome benefit.[197] [198] [199] While preoperative exercise training may be beneficial
for patients undergoing AAA repair, further investigation with RCTs is needed before it can be
recommended more widely.[200]
• Perioperative statin use slows aneurysm growth, reduces risk of rupture, and reduces mortality
from AAA repair or ruptured AAA.[5] Statins should be started at least 1 month before surgery to
reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and continued indefinitely.[3] [141]
• Patients with AAAs are at increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. There is
limited evidence, but in the absence of any contraindication, patients with AAA should receive

single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel).[5] [142] This should be continued during the
perioperative period.[3]
• Hypertension should be controlled to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[3] [5]
• Initiation of beta blockers is not recommended prior to AAA repair.[3] However, a beta-blocker can
be continued if a patient is already taking this at an appropriate dose.[3] Large trials where beta-
blockade was started a few days before surgery have indicated no benefit, or even harm, from
perioperative beta-blockade.[201] [202] [203]
Antibiotic cover:
• Antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients undergoing elective repair of AAA or emergent repair of
ruptured AAA to cover gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (i.e.,  Staphylococcus aureus , 
Staphylococcus epidermidis , and enteric gram-negative bacilli) and prevent graft infection.
• Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is tailored to patient clinical presentation and cultures, and in
accordance with local protocols.
Treatment of infectious/inflammatory cause
Once the patient is stable and urgent surgical repair, if indicated, has been prioritized, infectious or
inflammatory etiology should be addressed.
Infectious AAA
If the patient has a suspected infectious aneurysm, early diagnosis, prompt treatment with antibiotics and
urgent surgical repair is essential to improve outcomes.[3] Open surgical repair has traditionally been
considered gold standard for infectious aneurysms, though more recent data suggests that EVAR may
be associated with equal or superior outcomes.[3] [5][204] Extensive debridement is often needed. There
is a high risk of secondary infective complications and further surgery may be needed for new infectious
lesions.
Intraoperative cultures should be taken to accurately guide subsequent antibiotic therapy; however,
empirical antibiotics are often administered, as peripheral blood cultures and surgical specimen cultures
are negative in a large proportion of patients.[5]
Prolonged antibiotic therapy (from 4-6 weeks duration to lifelong) may be indicated depending on the
specific pathogen, the type of operative repair, and the patient's immunologic state.[3] [5]
Inflammatory AAA
Inflammatory aortitis (caused by, for example, Takayasu arteritis or giant cell arteritis) is treated with high-
dose corticosteroids and surgery.[3] [5] [205] Since the optimal management of patients with inflammatory
aortitis remains uncertain, patients with inflammatory aortitis should be managed and closely followed
by a multidisciplinary team.[3] Tamoxifen has been used alone or in combination with corticosteroids in
inflammatory aortitis.[3] [206][207] However, the superiority of combined therapy over corticosteroids
alone remains unproven.[208]
Surgical treatment of inflammatory AAAs poses a different challenge to surgeons compared with standard
degenerative AAAs due to the increased risk of iatrogenic bowel, caval, iliac vein, and ureteral injuries
during open surgical repair and the increased inflammatory response to endoprosthesis implantation.[3] 
Preoperative ureteral stent placement may be required to release hydronephrosis and help identification
of the ureter during surgery.[3] [206] High-level evidence comparing open repair and EVAR is not

available.[206] [209] It remains unclear whether EVAR alone has any beneficial effect on hydronephrosis,
and retroperitoneal fibrosis seems to resolve at a slower rate compared with open repair.[206]
Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) leak
Endoleak is persistent blood flow outside the graft and within the aneurysm sac.[210] [211] It is not a
complication following open repair; it is specific to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).
Postoperative surveillance can detect major endoleaks and aneurysm sac expansion.
Risk of endoleak following EVAR is 24%.[210] There are five types of endoleak.[5]
Type I:
• Leak at the attachment site (type IA at the proximal end of the endograft or iliac occluder; type IB at
the distal end); usually immediate, but delayed leaks may occur.

• Every effort should be made to repair type I endoleak before completing the procedure (e.g.,
balloon molding of the proximal seal zone, placement of a proximal cuff, endostaples, liquid

provided the surgical risk is acceptable.[3] [77] [213]

University of Michigan/Dr G.R. Upchurch, Departments of Vascular Surgery and Radiology
• Spontaneous resolution may occur, although persistence may result in sac growth.[214]
• If a type II endoleak or other abnormality of concern is observed on contrast-enhanced CT imaging
at 1 month after EVAR, postoperative imaging at 6 months is recommended.[77] Around 50% of
type II endoleaks are diagnosed before 30 day follow-up; 40% after 30 days, and 8% are diagnosed
after 12 months of follow-up.[215]
• Treatment remains controversial and is advocated either if persistent at 6-12 months or
when aneurysm sac size increases such that proximal and/or distal sealing zones may be
compromised.[216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221]
• Treatment of choice is transarterial coil embolization, although laparoscopic ligation of collateral
branches, direct percutaneous translumbar puncture of the sac, translumbar embolization, and
transcatheter transcaval embolization have been reported.[211] [216] [217] [218] [222] [223] [224]
[225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230]
Type III:
• Graft defect with leak through fabric tears, graft disconnection, or disintegration of the fabric.[210]
[211] [231]
• Repair is indicated upon discovery (endovascular stent graft extension).[3] [77] [217] [221] [232]
Type IV:
• Leak from graft wall porosity.[210] [211]
• These leaks are uncommon with newer stent grafts and are self-limited.[77] [217]

Type V (endotension):
• Endotension is increased intrasac pressure after EVAR without visualized endoleak on delayed
contrast CT scans.
• Endotension is less common with the newer-generation grafts.[77]
• There is no standardized method to measure endotension or consensus on indicated therapy in
the absence of aneurysm enlargement; however, treatment of endotension to prevent aneurysm
rupture is suggested in selected patients with continued aneurysm expansion.[77] [211] [221]

1st standard resuscitation measures
» Standard resuscitation measures should
be initiated immediately. These include:
airway management (supplemental oxygen
or endotracheal intubation and assisted
ventilation if the patient is unconscious);
securing intravenous access (central venous
catheter); arterial catheter and urinary catheter;
ensuring blood product availability (packed red
cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma) and
transfusing for resuscitation, severe anemia, and
coagulopathy; and notifying anesthetic, intensive
care unit (ICU), and operating teams.
» Aggressive fluid replacement may cause
dilutional and hypothermic coagulopathy and
secondary clot disruption from increased
blood flow, increased perfusion pressure,
and decreased blood viscosity, thereby
exacerbating bleeding.[121][122] A target
systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 50 to 70
mmHg and withholding fluids is advocated
preoperatively.[121][122] The American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend permissive
hypotension to reduce bleeding.[5] However,
recommended targets vary and there is no
consensus among global guideline groups.

» The American College of Cardiology/American

computed tomography (CT) imaging in
patients presenting with ruptured AAA who are
hemodynamically stable to evaluate whether
the AAA is amenable to endovascular repair.[5]
 This recommendation is supported by results
from the IMPROVE multicenter randomized
controlled trial, which suggest that for most
patients, confirmatory CT did not add significant
delays to treatment and facilitated appropriate
preoperative planning.[110]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
MANAGEMENT
Acute
» If the anatomy is suitable, the ACC/AHA
recommend endovascular repair over open
repair to reduce the risk of morbidity and
mortality.[5] In patients with confirmed ruptured
AAA, 3-year mortality was lower among those
randomized to endovascular aneurysm repair
(EVAR) than to an open repair strategy (48%
vs. 56%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to
0.90).[111] The difference between treatment
groups was no longer evident after 7 years of
follow-up (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.13). Re-
intervention rates were not significantly different
between the randomized groups at 3 years
(HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32).[111] There is
some evidence to suggest that an endovascular
strategy for repair of ruptured AAA may reduce
mortality more effectively in women than in
men.[111] [112]
» There is some evidence to suggest that mode
of anesthesia for operative repair of AAA affects
outcomes.[5] [113] In 2024, the European
Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) issued a
weak recommendation favoring local anesthesia
over general anesthesia in elective settings,
based on potential reduction in procedure
time, ICU admissions, and postoperative
hospital stay.[3] [114] [115] [116] The IMPROVE
multicenter randomized controlled trial detected
a significantly reduced 30-day mortality in
patients who had EVAR under local anesthesia
alone compared with general anesthesia
(adjusted OR 0.27, 0.1 to 0.7).[110] A separate
meta-analysis comparing mode of anesthesia for
endovascular repair of ruptured AAA replicated
these findings or improved outcomes with
EVAR under local anesthesia.[117] However,
another systematic review did not show any
mortality benefit with local anesthesia, but did
demonstrate shorter hospital stays.[118] Data
from the UK’s National Vascular Registry (9783
patients who received an elective, standard
infrarenal EVAR; general anesthetic, n = 7069;
regional anesthetic, n = 2347; local anesthetic, n
= 367) showed a lower 30 day mortality rate after
regional versus general anesthesia.[119] The
international multicenter Endurant Stent Graft
Natural Selection Global Post-Market Registry
(ENGAGE) study examined the outcomes
of 1231 patients undergoing EVAR under
general (62% of patients), regional (27%),
and local (11%) anesthesia.[120] The type of
anesthesia had no influence on perioperative
mortality or morbidity but the use of local or
regional anesthesia during EVAR appeared to
be beneficial in decreasing procedure time, need

» In patients with symptomatic aortic aneurysm,
urgent repair is indicated regardless of
diameter.[5] [79][103] The development of
new or worsening pain may herald aneurysm
expansion and impending rupture. Symptomatic,
nonruptured aneurysm is, therefore, best treated
urgently.[77] Under some circumstances,
intervention may be delayed for several hours to
optimize conditions to ensure successful repair;
these patients should be closely monitored in the
intensive care unit.[77]
» EVAR is increasingly used in the management
of patients with symptomatic AAA.[127] [128]

incidental finding: small
asymptomatic AAA
1st surveillance
» For AAA detected as an incidental finding,
surveillance is preferred to repair until the
theoretical risk of rupture exceeds the estimated
risk of operative mortality.[4]
» Early open surgery for the treatment of smaller
AAAs does not reduce all-cause or AAA-specific
mortality.[4] [131] One systematic review (4
trials, 3314 participants) found high-quality
evidence to demonstrate that immediate repair
of small AAA (4.0 cm to 5.5 cm) did not improve
long-term survival compared with surveillance
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.75 to
1.02, mean follow-up 10 years).[131] The lack
of benefit attributable to immediate surgery was
consistent regardless of patient age, diameter
of small aneurysm, and whether repair was
endovascular or open.[131]
» Surgical referral of smaller AAA is usually
reserved for rapid growth, or once the threshold
diameter for aneurysm repair is reached on
repeated ultrasonography.[4]
» However, in patients with an underlying
genetic cause or connective tissue disorder,
the threshold diameter for considering repair
should be individualized, depending on anatomic
features and underlying genetics (rupture
risk is higher at smaller aortic diameters in
some conditions, and surgical repair is more
challenging in certain disorders owing to the
increased arterial wall fragility and anatomy).[3]

incidental finding: large

1st elective surgical repair
» Generally, repair is indicated in patients with
large asymptomatic AAA (e.g., with a diameter
>5.5 cm in men or >5.0 cm in women in the
US, although treatment decisions based on
greater size may differ in other countries).[79]
Repair of aneurysms ≥5.5 cm offers a survival
advantage.[1] [77] [106] [107] [108]
» Decisions regarding repair should be
individualized, taking account of patient
preference, patient age, sex, perioperative risk
factors, and anatomic risk factors. Care should
be taken to evaluate patient quality of life, and
careful counseling undertaken regarding the
risks of surgery and subsequent quality of life.
A shared decision making approach taking into
account the risks and benefits of the procedures
is recommended.[5][131]
» Data suggest that in patients with large
AAAs (≥5.5 cm) undergoing elective repair,
EVAR is equivalent to open repair in terms of
overall survival, although the rate of secondary
interventions is higher for EVAR.[143] [144]
 EVAR reduces AAA-related mortality (but not
longer-term overall survival) in patients with
large AAA (≥5.5 cm) who are unsuitable for open
repair.[145]

associated with worse late survival than smaller
aneurysms (pooled hazard ratio 1.14 per 1-
cm increase in AAA diameter, 95% CI 1.09 to

standard surgical risk, open or EVAR should
be considered based on fitness, anatomy,
and patient preference. For patients with a

fenestrated and branched technologies should
be considered as first-line therapy. Fenestrated

If a type II endoleak or other abnormality of
concern is observed on contrast-enhanced CT

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Management
Emerging
Doxycycline
Doxycycline is a nonspecific inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs promote degradation of
collagen and elastin and are integral to aneurysm formation.[1] [33] One clinical trial found that prolonged
administration of doxycycline for 6 months is safe and well tolerated by patients with small asymptomatic
AAAs and is associated with a gradual reduction in plasma MMP-9 levels.[1] [245] Another small randomized
study reported no growth of aortic aneurysms in doxycycline-treated patients at 6 and 12 months.[246] [247]
 However, a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study concluded that doxycycline did not
significantly reduce the growth at 2 years of small AAAs (3.5 to 5.0 cm among men and 3.5 to 4.5 cm among
women) in patients ≥55 years of age.[248] A systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed the reduction in
MMP, but did not prove any corresponding reduction in AAA growth or need for repair.[249] A subanalysis of
systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that other antibiotics such as tetracyclines and macrolides
did not limit growth of AAA.[249][250] There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of doxycycline.[251]
Metformin
Observational evidence suggests that metformin may limit the progression of AAA disease and reduce the
incidence of clinically important AAA events.[252] [253] [254] The reduction of AAA enlargement rate in
patients prescribed metformin appears to be beyond that associated with the presence of diabetes itself.
Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these benefits, and to determine whether they apply to
both diabetic and nondiabetic patients.[252] [254] [255] [256]
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl
peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors
Other drugs used in the management of diabetes have shown protective effects against cardiovascular
diseases. This could represent a promising future therapy for slowing AAA growth.[257]
Endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS)
One systematic review of an endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS) device suggested that the device is
safe and effective for the treatment of endoleak complications of EVAR.[258] However, the device has been
subject to a medical device alert and recall by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA).[259] The alert and recall follows higher than expected rates of endoleak, graft migration, and
aneurysm sac enlargement. Further implants of the device have been stopped; for those patients implanted
with the Nellix EVAS device, the MHRA recommends enhanced surveillance because of a high risk of graft
failure.
Ischemic preconditioning
Ischemic preconditioning has been proven to have a protective effect on organ function after exposure to
reperfusion and potential reperfusion injury.[260] The process of ischemic preconditioning involves repeated
exposure of an organ or tissue to short, repeated periods of ischemia and reperfusion, to instigate a systemic
effect that protects the tissues from reperfusion injury.[260] Ischemic preconditioning has been shown to be
associated with favorable outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery; however, studies have not yet
proven any specific benefit in patients undergoing AAA repair.[260] [261] [262] 
3D printed template "phantoms"
3D printed phantoms have been used to help visualize complex patient anatomy, plan positioning of
fenestrations in grafts, help with device selection, predict navigational challenges, and predict the shape
and position of the graft after deployment. Larger scale studies are needed to assess their contribution to
improved outcomes and cost-effectiveness.[263] [264]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
In the US, guidelines recommend that infra-/juxtarenal AAAs measuring 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter with
ultrasonography/computed tomography (CT) should be monitored every 6 to 12 months.[5] Once larger
than 4.5 cm in women and 5 cm in men, these guidelines recommend surveillance every 6 months.[5]
 AAAs <3.9 cm can be monitored with ultrasonography every 2 to 3 years.[5] The American College
of Radiology (ACR) recommends that color duplex doppler ultrasound, CT of the abdomen and pelvis
with contrast, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are all appropriate imaging modalities for
surveillance of patients with asymptomatic AAA.[5] [299] There is also evidence to suggest that color
duplex doppler ultrasound may be as sensitive as CT for detecting endoleaks post EVAR and could be
utilized as a safe and effective alternative which avoids exposing the patients to further radiation.[300]
[301] [302]
A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data concluded that surveillance intervals of 2
years for 3.0- to 4.4-cm AAAs, and 6 months for 4.5- to 5.4-cm AAAs, are safe and cost-effective.[133]
Analysis of AAA growth and rupture rates indicated that, in order to maintain a AAA rupture risk <1%,
an 8.5-year surveillance interval is required for men with baseline AAA diameter of 3.0 cm.[133] The
corresponding estimated surveillance interval for men with an initial aneurysm diameter of 5.0 cm was
17 months. Despite having similar growth rates of small aneurysms, rupture rates were 4 times greater in
women than in men.[133] Surveillance programs and criteria for considering surgery need to be tailored
for women with opportunistically detected AAA.
The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) recommends incorporation of subaneurysmal aortas
(2.5 to 2.9 cm) into AAA surveillance recommendations since long-term cohort studies show that most
subaneurysmal aortas eventually progress to an AAA of which a substantial proportion will reach the
diameter threshold for consideration of repair.[3] Surveillance decisions should take into account life
expectancy, suitability for future repair, and patient preferences.[3]
Post repair
The US Society for Vascular Surgery recommends baseline surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT
and color duplex ultrasound in the first month after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).[5] [77] [221]
 If neither endoleak nor AAA enlargement is documented, imaging should be repeated at 12 months
using either contrast-enhanced CT or color duplex ultrasound imaging.[5] [77] Follow-up noncontrast CT
imaging is recommended at 5-year intervals after open repair or EVAR.[5] [77]
The ACR recommends computed tomography angiography (CTA) with contrast or MRA with and without
contrast of the abdomen and pelvis as usually appropriate for follow-up after EVAR or open repair of AAA.
MRA is more sensitive than CTA for the detection of endoleaks, however it has lower spatial resolution
and slower imaging speeds and stent material and orientation are also important considerations for the
suitability of MRA.[303]
The ESVS recommends that all patients should have CTA within 30 days after the initial repair.[3]
For patients who have been stratified as low risk of complications (no endoleak, anatomy within
manufacturer’s instruction for use [IFU], without high risk features [proximal neck diameter <30 mm and
angulation <60 degrees, and iliac diameter <20 mm], adequate overlap, and seal of 10 mm proximal
and distal stent graft apposition to arterial wall), the ESVS recommends consideration for limited follow-
up, with delayed imaging until 5 years after repair.[3] Patients stratified as high risk of complications
(presence of T2EL, insufficient overlap or seal <10 mm, anatomy outside IFU, large proximal neck [>30
mm], ectatic iliac fixation zones [>20 mm], or extreme angulation [>60 degrees]) may be considered
yearly exams with either CTA or duplex ultrasound.[3] CTA is preferred for this purpose and its findings
have been shown to have the strongest prognostic importance.[3] Duplex ultrasound exam can be used
in alternative to verify the absence of endoleaks and assess limb patency and flow, but since it lacks
assessment of stent graft overlap, seal length, and kink, it may need to be completed with noncontrast
CT.[3]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Women are at greater risk of postoperative complications (limb ischemia, renal and cardiovascular
complications) and mortality (in-hospital and 30-day) than men; strict long-term surveillance is essential in
female patients undergoing AAA repair.[165]
Antibiotic prophylaxis of graft infection is required prior to bronchoscopy, gastrointestinal or genitourinary
endoscopy, and any dental procedure that may lead to bleeding.[77]
Generalized sepsis, groin drainage, pseudoaneurysm formation, or ill-defined pain after open repair or
EVAR should prompt evaluation of graft infection.[77] Gastrointestinal bleeding after open repair or EVAR
should prompt evaluation of an aorto-enteric fistula.[77]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
abdominal compartment syndrome short term high
Rates of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are estimated at about 20% after open repair of
ruptured AAA.[3] A small retrospective review reported ACS in 34% of patients following open repair
of ruptured AAA and 21% after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).[268] A nationwide population-
based study (Swedish Vascular Registry) found that after ruptured AAA repair, ACS developed in 6.8%
following open repair compared with 6.9% after EVAR.[269] A systematic review of 46 studies, including
3064 patients, showed that the ACS affects an approximated 9% of patients following EVAR for ruptured
AAA.[270] ACS is associated with significant increases in perioperative mortality.[270] All patients should
be assessed for ACS if their condition does not improve after EVAR or open surgical repair of a ruptured
AAA.[79] Patients with abdominal compartment syndrome after open or endovascular treatment of a
ruptured AAA should be treated with decompressive laparotomy.[3]
ileus, intestinal obstruction, and ischemic colitis short term high
Ileus has been reported in 11% of patients, with intestinal obstruction and colitis each occurring in 1%
of patients undergoing open repair.[265] [271] One review reported a prevalence of clinically relevant
bowel ischemia of approximately 10% following surgery for ruptured AAA.[272] If colonic ischemia is
suspected in patients undergoing open or endovascular treatment for AAA, flexible sigmoidoscopy should
be considered to confirm the diagnosis.[3]
Ischemic colitis requiring colectomy is rare.
acute kidney injury short term high
Following EVAR and open repair of AAA, there is a significant incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).[273]
[274] [275] In open repair, this seems to be transient. However, following EVAR the causes are
multifactorial, and decline in renal function is significantly greater (especially with suprarenal fixation) than
in open surgery.[276] [277] AKI following EVAR is associated with medium-term increased morbidity and
mortality.[273] A strategy to preserve renal function by dose reduction of iodine contrast media, withdrawal
of nephrotoxic drugs and ensuring adequate hydration should be considered in patients undergoing EVAR
of a complex AAA.[3] Preservation of large accessory renal arteries (4 mm) should also be considered.[3]
 Interventions that have been shown in studies to have some potential benefit at reducing the incidence
of AKI after AAA repair include mannitol, antioxidant supplements, an extraperitoneal approach for open
repairs, and human atrial natriuretic peptide.[278]
postimplantation syndrome short term medium
Postimplantation syndrome is a poorly understood complication of EVAR, which occurs in the early
postoperative period and may last for up to 10 days following EVAR.[279] Fever, malaise, and back pain,
which may be due to cytokine release, are typical. Early major cardiovascular events have been reported
to be more common in patients who develop postimplantation syndrome, although one study reported that
postimplantation syndrome was not associated with a statistically significantly higher risk of cardiovascular
events and had no impact on mortality.[279] [280]
amputation due to limb ischemia short term low
Rates of amputation due to limb ischemia were very low (0.1% at 30 days) in a large series of patients (n
= 1135) who underwent open repair.[265] Patients with new onset or worsening of lower limb ischemia
should be evaluated immediately for graft related problems, such as limb kinking or occlusion.[3]

Abdominal aortic aneurysm Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
spinal cord ischemia short term low
Spinal cord ischemia is rare after EVAR, with an incidence in the EUROSTAR collaborators registry of
0.21%.[281] In a retrospective analysis of emergency endovascular treatment for ruptured AAA, 4 of 35
patients (11.5%) developed spinal cord ischemia postoperatively.[282] Delayed spinal cord ischemia
(developing 2 days after EVAR) has been reported.[283] Increased operative time, intravascular handling,
and difficult anatomy all contribute to an increased risk of spinal cord ischemia.[284] Early recognition is
essential, with treatment including spinal drains and administration of steroids. Only 25% of cases will
recover, with 25% showing some improvement, and 50% no improvement.[284]
impaired sexual function long term high
Damage to the autonomic nerves (present at the aorto-iliac bifurcation) during dissection in open repair,
as well as reduction in pelvic blood supply, can result in impotence and retrograde ejaculation. EVAR can
also result in significant erectile dysfunction, mainly due to internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion. Studies
comparing rates of erectile dysfunction after open repair versus EVAR have shown inconsistent findings.
One review estimated incidence of new erectile dysfunction of between 20% and 83% in the first year after
open repair (variation depended on trial type).[285] The estimated incidence of new erectile dysfunction
was no greater than 14.3% following endovascular repair (and was worse after bilateral rather than
unilateral IIA occlusion). However, one prospective single center study found no statistically significant
difference in de novo erectile dysfunction between open repair and EVAR groups.[286] 27% of the
patients reported erectile dysfunction before open repair increasing to 53% one year after surgery. The
corresponding frequencies after EVAR were 43% and 59% respectively.[3] [286] For patients treated for
AAA who are distressed by postoperative new onset sexual dysfunction, referral to specialized teams
should be considered.[3]
anastomotic pseudoaneurysm long term high
One case series reported para-anastomotic aneurysms in 10% of patients after aortic bypass
grafting.[287] The rate of femoral anastomotic pseudoaneurysm may be as high as 20% at 10 years
after aortobifemoral reconstruction for AAA.[288] Infection should be considered as an underlying cause
of para-anastomotic aneurysm.[3] Graft infection may be the underlying cause of secondary aneurysm
formation, particularly within the first years after repair.[3] For patients with noninfectious aorto-iliac para-
anastomotic aneurysm formation after previous AAA repair, endovascular repair should be considered
preferentially.[3]
aortic neck dilation long term high
Aortic neck dilation occurred in 24.6% of EVAR patients during 15 months to 9 years of follow-up.[184] A
composite clinical event of endoleak, migration, and reintervention was significantly more common in this
group than in those patients without aortic neck dilation.
graft infection long term medium
Can result from infection during implantation, or hematogenous seeding following dental procedures or
endoscopic procedures with biopsy. Incidence is low: a retrospective cohort study found that the 2-year
rate of graft infection was 0.19% following open repair versus 0.16% with EVAR.[289] Surgical removal of
the infected endograft is the optimum treatment; there is a high mortality rate with medical management
alone.[3] [290]
ureteric obstruction long term low
Ureteric obstruction is related to encasement of the ureters in an inflammatory perianeurysmal fibrosis
of unresolved etiology, rather than secondary to aneurysm compression.[291] Most often, ureteral

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
compression is associated with inflammatory aortic aneurysm. Extensive retroperitoneal adhesions may
result in ureteral obstruction in 18% of patients. The inferior vena cava may become involved.[292]
functional gastric outlet obstruction long term low
Duodenal obstruction is a consequence of compression of the duodenum in its fixed retroperitoneal course
between the aneurysmal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery.[291]
graft limb occlusion long term low
The incidence of graft limb occlusion up to 10 years after open AAA repair has been reported as being
between 2.6% and 3.0%.[293] [294] The risk of graft occlusion is greater with EVAR, with a reported
incidence of up to 7.2% in follow-up studies.[295] Kinking is a risk factor for graft limb occlusion following
EVAR.[296]
endoleak variable high
Risk of endoleak following EVAR is 24%.[210] There are five types of endoleak.[5] Type II endoleaks are
the most common. Repair may be indicated upon discovery of postoperative type I endoleak.
Endoleak is not a complication following open repair.
distal embolization variable low
Incidence is 3% to 29%, most commonly affecting the digits (blue toe syndrome). There is a 5% incidence
of distal embolization resulting in limb-threatening ischemia, digital ischemia, and calf myonecrosis.[297]
abdominal wall hernia variable low
Patients with aneurysmal disease have a high prevalence of abdominal wall hernias and 11% to 37% have
postoperative incisional hernias following abdominal surgery.[298] Mesh augmentation during closure of
the incision for open AAA repair can help reduce the occurrence of incisional hernias.[3] [298]
Prognosis
The natural course involves slow and steady growth. With progressive aneurysm enlargement, the risk of
AAA rupture increases.[3] Most patients with rupture will not survive to reach the operating suite; mortality
from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is estimated to be 80% to 90%.[5] Given the morbidity and
mortality associated with surgical intervention, repair is typically deferred until the theoretical risk of rupture
exceeds the estimated risk of operative mortality. The majority of patients undergoing open repair remain
without significant graft-related complications during the remainder of their lives (0.4% to 2.3% incidence
of late graft-related complications).[265] Five-year survival rates after intact aneurysm repair average
60% to 75%. Those undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are more likely to have a delayed
complication and require re-intervention and late survival may be worse in patients undergoing EVAR for
intact AAA.[167][168] [175] Other risk factors for poor outcome include skeletal muscle mass; there is a
significant link between low skeletal muscle mass and morbidity following AAA repair.[266] In elderly patients
there is an early deterioration in postoperative quality of life, with a delay to mental health recovery of about
4 to 6 weeks, and to physical health recovery of 1 to 3 months, regardless of operative technique. However,
quality of life does return to baseline and is maintained in the long term, supporting surgical intervention for
AAA in elderly patients.[267]

Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
