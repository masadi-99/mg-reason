Aortic coarctation Overview
Summary
Aortic coarctation is characterized by a blood pressure differential between upper and lower extremities
(upper >lower).
In neonates, may present with shock if there is inadequate systemic perfusion once the ductus arteriosus
closes.
Physical exam may show diminished, absent, or delayed lower extremity pulses compared with upper
extremity pulses.
Diagnosis is made by demonstration of aortic arch narrowing, typically by echocardiography.
Treatment may be surgical repair or percutaneous balloon dilation or stent placement.
Long-term complications include persistent hypertension or aneurysm formation at site of surgery or balloon.
Definition
Coarctation of the aorta is defined as a narrowing in the aorta, most commonly at the site of insertion of
the ductus arteriosus, just distal to the left subclavian artery. Less commonly, there may be diffuse arch
hypoplasia with a long segment of narrowing, proximal to the left subclavian artery, or the obstruction may be
in the abdominal aorta. It is often associated with a diffuse arteriopathy and bicuspid aortic valve. It typically
presents with upper extremity systolic hypertension or murmur. If the narrowing is severe, it may present in
the newborn period once the ductus arteriosus closes as low cardiac output and shock (critical coarctation).

Aortic coarctation Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Coarctation of the aorta is a common congenital heart defect, constituting about 5% to 8% of all congenital
heart defects.[3] In the US, it occurs more frequently in males than in females. Most cases are sporadic,
although recent evidence shows a familial link with nonsyndromic left ventricular outflow tract obstructive
lesions.[4] [5]
Aortic coarctation is often seen in association with other cardiovascular malformations, such as bicuspid
aortic valve and ventricular septal defect. It has been increasingly thought of as part of a more global
arteriopathy rather than a strictly isolated lesion. There are also syndromic associations including Shone
complex, Turner syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.[4]
Etiology
Coarctation of the aorta is primarily a congenital malformation. Increased attention is being focused on
coarctation being part of a more diffuse arteriopathy, and careful attention to the morphology of the aortic
valve (often bicuspid) and ascending aorta is imperative.[6]
The etiology of congenital coarctation is incompletely understood, but 2 primary theories explain the
narrowed segment:
1. The narrowed segment is underdeveloped during fetal life due to reduced blood flow across the
developing arch. This is particularly thought to be responsible when associated with additional left-
sided lesions such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
2. Ductal tissue extends into the thoracic aorta, and when the ductus arteriosus constricts and closes
postnatally, the thoracic aorta is constricted.[7]
Much less commonly, aortic coarctation can be acquired. Takayasu arteritis, a large vessel vasculitis,
can result in aortic coarctation. In these cases, the narrowed segment is often in the descending thoracic
or abdominal aorta.[8] Rarely, severe atherosclerotic disease can result in aortic obstruction with
pathophysiologic consequences similar to coarctation.
Pathophysiology
The effects of aortic coarctation depend on the severity of the narrowing and resultant elevated afterload on
the left ventricle.
Severe narrowing of the aortic arch that presents in the neonatal period with low output cardiac failure and
shock once the ductus arteriosus closes is termed critical coarctation. These infants require a prostaglandin
E1 infusion to maintain a patent ductus arteriosus and surgical repair after medical stabilization.
Mild and moderate narrowing can be clinically silent for many years; however, the hypertension associated
with coarctation can have longstanding effects of hypertensive vascular disease even after the narrowed
segment is repaired. Collateral blood vessels often enlarge and provide a route for blood to bypass the
narrowed segment of the aorta. Indications for repair are congestive heart failure, systolic hypertension,
or a peak pressure gradient >20 mmHg across the coarctation measured by Doppler echocardiography
or catheterization.[9] Repair can be surgical or percutaneous depending on the patient's age and
presentation.[10]

Aortic coarctation Theory
Classification
Site of coarctation
There is no formal classification, but the following are useful and commonly accepted classifications:
1. Juxtaductal
• Most common
• Narrowing is at the insertion site of the ductus arteriosus.
2. Other (preductal, infrarenal, abdominal)
• Less common
• Narrowing can be proximal to the left subclavian artery or in the abdominal aorta.
3. Tubular hypoplasia
• Rare
• Long segment of narrowing.
Exact location of the narrowing in relationship to the ductus
arteriosus
• Narrowing at the ductus is termed juxtaductal, which has also been termed an infantile coarctation.
• Narrowing proximal to the ductal insertion is termed a preductal coarctation and is typically associated
with hypoplasia of the transverse arch.
• Postductal coarctations occur distal to the ductal insertion.
• An abdominal coarctation occurs in the abdominal aorta and may be associated with narrowing of the
abdominal aortic vessels.

Presence of associated abnormalities
A third classification has been proposed that combines the anatomic features of the coarctation with the
presence of associated anomalies:[1]
• Type I: coarctation with or without patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
• IA: with ventricular septal defect (VSD)
• IB: with other major cardiac defects.
• Type II: coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia, with or without PDA
• IIA: with VSD
• IIB: with other major cardiac defects.
• Type III: coarctation with tubular hypoplasia of the isthmus and segment between left carotid and
subclavian arteries, with or without PDA
• IIIA: with VSD
• IIIB: with other major cardiac defects.

Case history
Case history #1
A 4-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a well-child visit. His mother reports him to be doing well
and has no concerns. On exam, he is noted to have a right upper extremity blood pressure of 140/70
mmHg. His cardiovascular exam shows a quiet precordium, a normal point of maximal impact, normal S1,
and normally split S2. A 2/6 long systolic murmur is heard over his back, and 2+ radial pulses and trace
femoral pulses are felt.
Case history #2
A newborn infant is noted to have respiratory distress 2 days after birth. On examination she is mottled
and has weak upper extremity pulses with no palpable femoral pulses. Her arterial blood gas shows a
profound metabolic acidosis.
Other presentations
Rarely, an adult presents with hypertension and severe headache due to rupture of a berry aneurysm in
the circle of Willis, which is thought to be associated with aortic coarctation in 10% of patients.[2]

Aortic coarctation Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Most patients with mild to moderate aortic coarctation are asymptomatic. However, severe coarctation may
present with hypotension, cyanosis, and shock in the neonatal period once the ductus arteriosus closes.
History
In older patients a history of unexplained hypertension present from a young age may be elicited.
These patients may have been treated unsuccessfully with antihypertensive medications. Claudication
of the lower limbs may be present. In rare cases, an adult may present with intracranial hemorrhage
from a ruptured berry aneurysm in the circle of Willis associated with aortic coarctation. Additionally,
young individuals exhibiting hypertension in the upper limbs or experiencing leg fatigue during physical
activities should be evaluated for coarctation of the aorta. These symptoms can indicate the presence of a
significant narrowing even when other signs are not as apparent.[15]
Physical exam
May present with upper extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypotension.[16] If the upper extremity
systolic blood pressure (BP) is >95 percentile for age or if the lower extremity pulses are diminished or
absent, noninvasive BP measurements in all 4 extremities should be obtained. Attention should be given
to ensure that the BP cuff fits appropriately (this often requires a different size for the upper and lower
extremities).
Cardiac exam may be normal or a long systolic murmur may be heard at the left upper sternal border and
over the back. A systolic ejection click may be heard if there is an associated bicuspid aortic valve.
Faint or absent femoral artery pulses or femoral artery pulses that are delayed when palpated
simultaneously with upper extremity pulses should raise the suspicion of a coarctation.
Rarely the right subclavian artery may arise anomalously from the descending aorta after the area of
coarctation. In this situation the right arm BP will be the same as the leg. Strong suspicion of coarctation
should still prompt further evaluation.
Investigations
If aortic coarctation is suspected based on physical exam, early testing by echocardiography is
required.[17]
In children the echocardiogram should be performed by a sonographer trained in congenital heart disease
(CHD) or referral to a pediatric cardiologist should be made.[18] The demonstration of a gradient across a
narrowed segment of the aorta confirms the diagnosis.
ECG should be performed as part of the initial workup in patients with suspected CHD or hypertension.
Chest x-ray is important to determine severity, such as evidence of heart failure.[17]
Echocardiography is typically utilized first and in general is able to define the anatomy and guide
management.[17] Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA), depending on the local expertise of the center, are often used to assist in the
diagnosis and interventional planning. Rarely, cardiac catheterization with angiography is used if the
diagnosis remains uncertain after noninvasive studies.[17] [19]

Aortic coarctation Diagnosis
Routine evaluation for associated intracardiac anomalies should be part of the initial echocardiogram, with
particular care paid to the aortic valve morphology and aortic root. Particular attention should be given
to commonly coexisting conditions such as ventricular septal defects, bifoliate aortic valves, aortic and
subaortic stenosis, and mitral valve abnormalities, especially when the aortic coarctation is adjacent to the
arterial duct or involves a nonconfluent aortic arch.[15] Older patients diagnosed with aortic coarctation
should also be screened for intracranial aneurysms by MRA or CT angiography.[20] Consideration for
genetic evaluation is also warranted when there are dysmorphic features, multiple organ abnormalities, or
additional intracardiac or vascular abnormalities.

aortic arch, aortic coarctation, truncus arteriosus, and ventricular septal defects. PHACE syndrome
is rare, in which the association of Posterior fossa malformations, Hemangioma, and Arterial,
Cardiovascular, and Eye abnormalities may be seen.[13] These patients may have coarctations that
may be complex and long-segment in nature.[14]
claudication (uncommon)
• Leg pain on walking due to reduced blood flow.
headache (uncommon)
• Rarely, can present with a severe headache due to an intracranial hemorrhage from an associated
berry aneurysm in the circle of Willis.
systolic ejection click (uncommon)
• If associated with a bicuspid aortic valve.

• Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a group of cardiac anomalies characterized by underdevelopment
of the left side of the heart with severe hypoplasia of the ascending aorta. Shone complex is a
multilevel left heart obstruction including supravalvar mitral ring, parachute mitral valve, subaortic
stenosis, and aortic coarctation.

• Complete two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiogram can
accurately establish the diagnosis of aortic coarctation in most
patients as well as determining any associated malformations.
• In neonates with critical coarctation, the patency of the ductus can be
assessed. Additionally, continuous Doppler of the abdominal aorta
will often show diastolic run off.[21]

Condition Differentiating signs /
symptoms
Differentiating tests
Aortic stenosis (AS) • Presenting features vary
depending on the severity
of stenosis. With mild
AS, the patient may be
asymptomatic with a harsh
systolic ejection quality
murmur at the upper right
sternal border with radiation
to the carotids on physical
exam. In moderate or
severe AS, the patient may
have significant shortness
of breath, especially on
exertion.
• Differentiated from
coarctation of the aorta by
echocardiogram.
• Two-dimensional
echocardiogram of the aortic
valve shows an abnormally
narrowed or dysplastic aortic
valve.
• Color Doppler and pulse
Doppler across the aortic
valve show turbulent blood
flow across the valve and
are used to measure the
gradient.
• Patients with aortic
coarctation with associated
bicuspid aortic valve may
also have AS.
Interrupted aortic arch • Presents as shock in
neonates. Unable to clinically
differentiate between
interruption of the aortic arch
and critical coarctation of the
aorta.
• Echocardiogram will
differentiate the severe
narrowing seen in critical
coarctation from a frank
interruption.
Left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction
• Depending on the level
and severity of the
obstruction, patients may
be asymptomatic or may
present with shortness
of breath, especially on
exertion.
• An echocardiogram will
differentiate the level of the
obstructed or narrowed area
in the aorta. Using color and
pulse Doppler, any narrowing
in the left ventricular outflow
tract can be localized to
the valvar, subvalvar, or
supravalvar area, or across
the aortic arch.
Essential hypertension • Similar clinical presentation.
• Lower extremity pulses
are usually normal unless
peripheral vascular disease
present.
• Four-extremity blood
pressure shows no gradient.
• Echocardiogram shows
normal flow across the aortic
arch and normal Doppler of
the abdominal aorta.
Renal artery stenosis • Similar clinical presentation. • Renal artery Doppler shows
renal artery stenosis.
• Normal echocardiogram.
Pheochromocytoma • Hypertension with
associated symptoms such
as palpitations and flushing.
• A 24-hour urine collection
is positive for elevated urine
creatinine, metanephrines,
and catecholamines.

Criteria
Clinical severity
1. Mild to moderate
• Collateral blood vessels often enlarge and provide a route for blood to bypass the narrowed segment
of the aorta.
• May be asymptomatic or present with hypertension.
2. Severe (critical coarctation)
• Well tolerated during fetal life because 90% of blood is shunted across the ductus arteriosus.
• After birth, the infant will present with low cardiac output and shock once the ductus arteriosus closes.
Criteria for significant coarctation[16]
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association list the following commonly used criteria for
defining significant coarctation in children and adults:
• Evidence of upper extremity hypertension (at rest, on ambulatory blood pressure [BP] monitoring, or
with pathologic BP response to exercise) or left ventricular hypertrophy and evidence for one of the
following gradient measurements:
• A noninvasive blood pressure difference of >20 mm Hg between the upper and lower

• A peak-to-peak gradient of >20 mm Hg across the coarct by catheterization; or a peak-to-peak
gradient of >10 mm Hg across the coarct by catheterization in the setting of decreased left
ventricular systolic function or significant collateral flow
• A mean gradient of >20 mm Hg across the coarct by Doppler echocardiography; or a mean
gradient of >10 mm Hg across the coarct by Doppler echocardiography in the setting of
decreased left ventricular systolic function or significant collateral flow.
Screening
Routine screening of all neonates with pulse-oximetry is recommended to detect critical congenital heart
disease, including critical coarctations.[18] [24] [25]
All well-child visits should include routine palpation of femoral pulses starting with the first nursery visit.
Particular attention should be paid to any difference in caliber or timing of the upper and lower extremity
pulses. Infants and children should have noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained during
this visit. Any question of a differential in the pulses or an elevated upper extremity BP should prompt
measurement of BP in all 4 extremities.
In addition to routine postnatal screening, fetal echocardiography is recommended for early detection of
congenital heart defects, including aortic coarctation, particularly in fetuses at risk. This screening involves
the use of advanced Doppler techniques to evaluate the aortic arch and detect potential abnormalities
indicative of coarctation. These techniques are effective in identifying abnormal flow patterns that may
suggest aortic narrowing, which can be critically important for timely diagnosis and management. Pregnant
women with known risk factors or abnormal findings in routine prenatal ultrasounds should be referred for
detailed fetal echocardiographic evaluation. This exam can play a pivotal role in planning for necessary

Aortic coarctation Diagnosis
interventions and optimizing neonatal outcomes. It is, however, very important to note that prenatal diagnosis
of coarctation can be quite difficult in the setting of the large prenatal ductus arteriosus and can develop
postnatally with ductal closure. Thus vigilance remains important postnatally for this lesion even in the setting
of an apparently normal fetal echocardiogram.[26]
Adults with a diagnosis of an intracranial berry aneurysm should have their BP measured. If the upper
extremity BP is high, measurement should be repeated on a lower extremity, to rule out aortic coarctation.
Routine evaluation for associated intracardiac anomalies should be part of the initial echocardiogram.
Patients diagnosed with aortic coarctation should also be screened for intracranial aneurysms, although
there are no formal guidelines. Consideration for genetic evaluation is also warranted when there are
dysmorphic features, multiple organ abnormalities, or additional intracardiac or vascular abnormalities. If
associated with a bicuspid aortic valve, consideration should be given to screening of first-degree relatives.
In the context of ongoing care, it is vital to maintain a proactive approach to cardiovascular health in patients
with aortic coarctation, even beyond the initial treatment phase. Regular cardiovascular risk assessments
are crucial, particularly in monitoring for potential atherosclerosis, which may develop as a consequence
of altered hemodynamics. This emphasizes the need for an integrated care model that includes both
adult congenital heart disease specialists and general cardiologists to manage not only the immediate
complications but also the long-term cardiovascular risks associated with aortic coarctation.[27]

Aortic coarctation Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The main goal in treatment is complete repair of the coarcted segment with minimal complications and no
residual gradient across the narrowed segment. The type of repair depends on the age of the patient at
diagnosis and the severity of the coarctation. There is no clear evidence to support the superiority of either
surgical- or catheter-based treatment for coarctation of the aorta.[29] [30]
Critical coarctation
Neonates with critical coarctation should be given alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) to maintain ductal
patency. Surgical repair is the preferred choice in neonates, as it is associated with fewer reinterventions
than transcatheter repair.[31]
Surgical repair
Repair of coarctation is performed on diagnosis to prevent the complications of longstanding
hypertension. Indications for urgent repair are congestive heart failure, systolic hypertension, or a
peak pressure gradient >20 mmHg across the coarctation measured by Doppler echocardiography or
catheterization.[6] [9] [16]
There are multiple surgical techniques depending on the length of the narrowing.
1. Short segment narrowing
• The narrowed segment is resected with an extended end-to-end anastomosis of the aorta.[32]
2. Medium-length segment narrowing
• It may be necessary to perform a more extensive arch reconstruction with placement of a patch or
subclavian flap aortoplasty, in which the left subclavian artery is brought down as a flap to widen
the narrowed segment. While subclavian flap aortoplasty can significantly affect the development
of the left upper extremity and has a higher long-term mortality, a long-term follow-up of a cohort
repaired at a single institution found no lifestyle limitations.[33]
3. Long segment narrowing (rare)
• If the segment is considered too long for either of the above procedures, a bypass graft across the
area of coarctation may be necessary.
When the surgical approach is appropriately tailored to the individual patient and their anatomy, the
residual or recoarctation rate is approximately 6%.[32]
Death from surgical repair is rare and significant improvements in hypertension are typically observed.[34]
Complications from surgery are also unusual and include postoperative hypertension, recurrent laryngeal
nerve and phrenic nerve injury, postoperative chylothorax from lymphatic duct disruption, long-term
recoarctation, and, rarely, paraplegia in patients with inadequate collateral circulation. Use of left atrium-
to-descending aortocardiopulmonary bypass during surgical repair is thought to protect the spinal cord in
patients with inadequate collateral circulation.[35]
Percutaneous repair
In children and adults with a discrete narrowing, percutaneous balloon angioplasty with or without stent
implantation is an alternative to surgery.[36] [37] [38] Percutaneous stent implantation has a 98% success

rate in repair of aortic coarctation.[39] Some authors have suggested that balloon angioplasty may be
superior to surgery, but this remains highly controversial and the level of evidence is poor.[40] [41] [42]
In older children, some authors suggest that percutaneous stent implantation may be superior to balloon
angioplasty alone, as it has a lower restenosis rate and incidence of aortic wall abnormalities.[43]
The overall complication rate of stent implantation is around 12%, including femoral artery access-related
complications, aneurysm formation, aortic dissection, and stroke.[39]
Percutaneous repair is generally not recommended for children <1 year old, as recurrence rates are high.
Additionally, stent placement is limited both by patient size and by the rapid growth seen during infancy.
Following the placement of artificial materials, such as stents, during interventions for aortic coarctation, it
is recommended to prescribe antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) for at least 6 months to prevent thrombotic
complications.[15]
Recurrent coarctation
Recurrent coarctation occurs in approximately 10% to 20% of patients.[44] Stent implantation has
a higher rate of restenosis compared with surgical repair.[45] However, in general for patients with
a recurrent coarctation, repeat surgery is more complicated than an initial intervention. Recurrent
coarctation is often treated with balloon angioplasty or stent placement depending on age and anatomy.

Bioabsorbable stents
Bioabsorbable stents may be available in the future to minimize the need for repeated dilations of stents in
growing patients.
Secondary prevention
Prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is recommended for 6 months after intervention or surgery is
performed.[54]
Patient discussions
Patients with repaired aortic coarctation should continue to have routine follow-up with a cardiologist
throughout their lifetime. These patients can typically lead normally active lives without restriction.
Patients with arterial hypertension, residual obstruction, or other complicating factors should be cautioned
against intensive isometric exercise.[17]
Patients with repaired aortic coarctation are known to have an increased risk of coronary artery disease.
As patients transition from adolescent to adult care, it is important to provide education on self-
management and to help them build their medical knowledge. For example, ensure that they are
equipped with the skills needed to make medical appointments and refill prescriptions, and that they
understand the importance of lifestyle interventions such as weight management and non-smoking.[53]

Aortic coarctation Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients with coarctation of the aorta require life-long follow-up with a cardiologist experienced in
congenital heart disease.[16] [51] While frequency should be individualized to the individual patient's
repair and their clinical status, there are published guidelines to guide the frequency of follow-up and
testing.[20] Particular attention should be paid to the potential for ongoing hypertension, recoarctation
requiring reintervention, cerebral aneurysm, aortic pseudoaneurysm, and dissection. Neurodevelopmental
surveillance and screening is also important when caring for these patients particularly if they had repair
in infancy.[52]
Upper and lower extremity blood pressures should be measured at every clinic visit.
Periodic echocardiograms (every 1-3 years) should be performed to assess the possibility of recoarctation
or aneurysm formation. In older children and adults, echocardiographic windows are often not adequate
to fully assess the aortic vasculature. In these cases, follow-up imaging with computed tomography
angiography or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allows assessment of the aortic
vasculature in great detail and facilitates planning for any necessary surgical or catheter-based
interventions.[23] [47]

systemic hypertension variable high
Many patients with coarctation of the aorta will have some degree of residual narrowing of the aortic arch.
A significant gradient, particularly with exercise, may be seen.
Gradients >20 mmHg are felt to be indications for intervention.
Persistent hypertension can occur even in patients without residual coarctation.[48]
recoarctation after repair variable medium
May occur after either surgical or transcatheter repairs due to scar formation at the site of intervention.

The challenges associated with living with congenital heart disease can lead to depression and anxiety
in as many as half of patients. Early-life stressors such as time in intensive care units and other traumatic
healthcare experiences can also have a significant impact.[50]
Psychological care should be a routine part of congenital heart disease care, with access given to
psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy where needed.[50]
aortic aneurysm variable low
May occur at the site of either surgical or transcatheter interventions. Additionally, may be related to
underlying pathology of the vessel or an associated bicuspid aortic valve. If an aneurysm is suspected and
is shown to be enlarging, surgical resection is typically required. An alternative is placement of a covered
stent over the aneurysmal area.[47]

Prognosis
The overall prognosis for patients with isolated coarctation is excellent. Patients may require long-term
treatment for hypertension, even in the absence of residual coarctation. Antihypertensives, including ACE-
inhibitors, beta blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockade, have been utilized.[46] The long-term effects of
systemic hypertension and decreased vascular reactivity are unclear.
Patients in whom the coarctation is associated with additional intracardiac defects typically are at higher risk
of long-term problems related to the additional defects.
Recoarctation may be seen in both surgically and transcatheter-treated patients; therefore, ongoing lifetime
outpatient follow-up with cardiology is necessary.
As patients age, careful follow-up with a cardiologist is imperative, as patients with aortic coarctation have a
higher incidence of coronary artery disease.

This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.

accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
