-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to medical decision making, extract all claims that could be relevant to information discovery.

-Steps-
1. Analyze the given text for factual statements, guidelines, recommendations, or assertions that could be useful for medical decision making
2. For each identified claim, extract the following information:
- subject_entity: The main entity or concept the claim is about
- object_entity: The entity or concept being claimed about the subject
- claim_type: The type of claim (e.g., "treatment", "diagnosis", "risk_factor", "contraindication", "indication", "side_effect", "mechanism")
- claim_status: Whether the claim is "supported", "refuted", or "conflicted"  
- claim_description: A clear, concise description of the claim
- claim_source_text: The exact text that supports this claim
Format each claim as ("claim"{tuple_delimiter}<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source_text>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:

Text:
Patients with acute myocardial infarction should receive aspirin 325mg immediately unless contraindicated. Beta-blockers reduce mortality when started within 24 hours post-MI.

Output:
