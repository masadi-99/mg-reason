Cardiac arrest Overview
Summary
Cardiac arrest is a sudden state of circulatory failure due to a loss of cardiac systolic function.
The most common shockable rhythms associated with cardiac arrest are pulseless ventricular tachycardia
and ventricular fibrillation.
The most common underlying causes are ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction. In some
settings, cardiac arrest is the result of respiratory arrest triggered by opioid toxicity.
Presentation is usually sudden and manifests as loss of consciousness but can be preceded by chest pain or
dyspnea.
Treatment is through implementing the algorithms for basic and advanced cardiac life support, depending on
the provider’s level of training.
The overall survival from cardiac arrest, especially unwitnessed, is poor and, among early survivors, is
fraught with complications of many organ systems due to ischemic injury (i.e., multisystem organ failure).
Definition
This topic covers cardiac arrest in adults. Sudden cardiac arrest is a sudden state of circulatory failure due
to a loss of cardiac systolic function. It is the result of 4 specific cardiac rhythm disturbances: ventricular
fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), pulseless electrical activity, and asystole. Torsades de
pointes is a subgroup of polymorphic VT in patients with an underlying prolonged QT interval, sometimes
related to hypomagnesemia.

Cardiac arrest Theory
Epidemiology
Due to its sudden nature and often unrecognized arrhythmic etiology, the epidemiologic characteristics
of cardiac arrest are difficult to determine with precision. Nevertheless, estimates can be made. Because
of fundamental differences in the underlying pathogenesis and system of care, epidemiological data for
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) are collected and reported
separately.[2] In the US, in 2022, the incidence of individuals of any age experiencing emergency medical
services-assessed OHCA was 88.8 per 100,000.[2] In Europe, this figure has been reported as 84 per
100,000 population per year.[3] In the US, incidence of IHCA varies across hospitals, from 2.4 to 25.5 per
1000 admissions, resulting in 292,000 cases annually.[2] [4]
Despite advances in the treatment of cardiac arrest, prognosis remains poor. According to the US Cardiac
Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES), survival to hospital admission after emergency medical
services-treated nontraumatic OHCA in 2022 was 24.9% for all presentations, with higher survival rates in
public places (36.9%) and lower survival rates in homes/residences (23.5%) and nursing homes (14.4%).
Survival to hospital discharge after OHCA was estimated to be 9.3%.[2] Unadjusted survival rate after IHCA
was 18.4% in the UK National Cardiac Arrest Audit database between 2011 and 2013. Survival was 49%
when the initial rhythm was shockable and 10.5% when the initial rhythm was not shockable.[5] According to
multiple studies, females with OHCA are older, less likely to present with shockable rhythms, and less likely
to collapse in public compared with males. Despite these factors that are known to reduce survival, females
have been shown to have equivalent or higher rates of survival to hospital discharge or to 30 days relative to
males.[6]
If resuscitation attempts are unsuccessful, the situation is referred to as sudden cardiac death
(SCD). Incidence of SCD increases with age; it is, around 50 per 100,000 person-years in the fifth to
sixth decades of life, rising to at least 200 per 100,000 in the eighth decade of life.[7] At any age, males
have higher SCD rates compared with females, even after adjustment for risk factors of coronary artery
disease.[7] Ethnic background also has a large effect, with black people, particularly women, having a higher
incidence of SCD compared to white people.[7] [8] In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study,
the sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for SCD comparing black with white participants was 2.12, with a fully
adjusted HR of 1.38. The reasons for this disparity are not fully understood, but lower socioeconomic status
and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (particularly diabetes and hypertension) have been
shown to be important contributors.[8]
Etiology
Sudden cardiac arrest is the term used to describe the ultimate result of four different cardiac arrhythmias:
ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and asystole.
Each of these rhythms may present in different clinical scenarios, though VT and VF are the most common
causes of sudden cardiac arrest.[9]
Cardiac arrest results from many disease processes; a consensus statement by the International Liaison
Committee on Resuscitation recommends categorization into events with medical causes or external causes
(drowning, trauma, asphyxia, electrocution, and drug overdose).[10] In a Swedish registry of 70,846 out-of-
hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) from 1992 to 2014, 92% of cases had medical causes. Trauma was the
most common cause of nonmedical etiology (26%).[11]

Cardiac arrest Theory
THEORY
Overall, the main underlying causes of cardiac arrest are ischemic heart disease (62.2%), unspecified
cardiovascular disease (12.1%), and cardiomyopathy/dysrhythmias (9.3%).[12] Among patients with OHCA
who were resuscitated and hospitalized from 2012 to 2016, acute coronary syndrome and other cardiac
causes accounted for the largest proportion of cases. Among patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests,
respiratory failure was the most common cause.[13] Causes of sudden cardiac death vary by age, with a
higher incidence of cardiomyopathies, dysrhythmias, myocarditis and coronary abnormalities in younger
people, and more chronic structural heart disease in older people.[7] Among people ages ≤18 years, 39% of
sudden cardiac arrests are sports-related.[14]
VT and VF cardiac arrests are most often the result of ischemic heart disease and acute myocardial
ischemia.[12] They may also present in the setting of nonischemic left ventricular dysfunction, premature
ventricular beats (R-on-T phenomenon), prolonged QT interval secondary to medications, electrolyte
abnormalities, familial syndromes of conduction abnormality (disorders in cardiac ion channels), other
cardiomyopathies, and drug intoxications (e.g., cocaine).[15] [16] [17]
The most common causes of PEA are myocardial ischemia/infarction, hypovolemia, hypoxia, and pulmonary
embolism.[18]
Other potential causes of cardiac arrest, all of which require emergency treatment, include hypoxia,
hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, hydrogen ion excess (acidosis), hypothermia, hypo- or hyperglycemia, trauma,
tension pneumothorax, obstructive shock (pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction), toxins, and cardiac
tamponade.[19]
Pathophysiology
In ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF), acute myocardial ischemia results in changes in
the concentration of many components of the intracellular and extracellular milieu (e.g., pH, electrolytes,
and adenosine triphosphate). In turn, these changes form the basis for pathogenic impulse formation and
propagation of arrhythmia.[20] In patients with areas of myocardial scarring, the mechanism for arrhythmia is
likely a re-entrant circuit generated by surviving myofibrils within areas of fibrosis.[21] Studies of nonischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy have shown that the mechanism of arrhythmia is not re-entry, but more likely the
initiation of VT/VF from early or late after-depolarizations in the setting of a prolonged action potential
duration, which in turn is due to the altered function of various ion channels.[22]
Another cause of VT/VF is the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited disorder of conduction.
Various mutations in ion channels are seen in the different subtypes of the disease, but the ultimate result
is disordered repolarization and depolarization, which prolongs the action potential duration and therefore
the QT interval.[23] Events in these patients often occur at times of increased sympathetic surge, though
the specific triggers vary among each of the mutational subtypes.[21] Drugs implicated in the acquired
LQTS also cause alterations in ion channels leading to problems in depolarization/repolarization, and may
uncover otherwise silent mutations involved in LQTS.[24] Culprit drugs include class IA anti-arrhythmics (e.g.,
procainamide), class III anti-arrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone), macrolide antibiotics, pentamidine, antimalarials,
antipsychotics, arsenic trioxide, and methadone.[25]
Pulseless electrical activity) is defined by the presence of organized electrical depolarization of the
myocardium without appropriate myocardial contraction, and hence inadequate circulation. The mechanism
for this disorder is a loss of contractile force despite normal electrical stimulation, which may be due to

decreased preload, increased afterload, or changes intrinsic to the myocardium (e.g., ischemia and changes
in ion concentrations) that impair inotropy.[26]
Classification
Advanced cardiovascular life support pulseless arrest algorithm[1]
Cardiac arrest is approached as a dichotomy of:
• Shockable rhythms (pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), and
• Nonshockable rhythms (pulseless electrical activity and asystole).
Case history
Case history #1
A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 40 pack-years of cigarette smoking,
and remote percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, is witnessed falling to the ground while
shoveling her sidewalk. She has not complained of any preceding symptoms. The emergency medical
personnel who respond quickly to the scene find her unconscious and pale, with agonal respirations but
no pulse. After the pads from an automated external defibrillator are attached, the patient is noted to be in
ventricular fibrillation.
Other presentations
Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole are less common presentations of cardiac arrest. PEA is
defined as the presence of electrical activity in the absence of cardiac output. When there is no electrical
activity, the rhythm is referred to as asystole.

Cardiac arrest Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
For health-care providers, the diagnosis of sudden cardiac arrest is a definitive one. The patient is
unresponsive, and assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation shows absence of normal breathing
and no signs of circulation. Agonal respirations may be present. Assessment of the specific cardiac rhythm
disturbance responsible should be immediate, whether by automated external defibrillator or other cardiac
monitoring, and is essential for management (but should not delay CPR). Possibilities include ventricular
fibrillation (VF), pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and asystole.
Torsades de pointes is a subgroup of polymorphic VT in patients with an underlying prolonged QT interval.

Lay rescuers are not able to determine with accuracy if a patient in cardiac arrest has a pulse. It is
recommended that the lay rescuer assume that a person who is unresponsive and has absent or agonal
respirations is in cardiac arrest and should begin CPR.[1] The risk of harm is low if the person is not
in cardiac arrest.[1] Unfortunately, the rate of lay responders providing CPR in cardiac arrest is low
(approximately 35% to 40% globally), despite the fact that lay responder CPR approximately doubles survival
from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and forms a crucial link in the chain of survival.[49]
Clinical assessment
A thorough but timely search must be made for the underlying cause of cardiac arrest, both during
resuscitation and following successful resuscitation. Physical exam may demonstrate an elevated jugular

Cardiac arrest Diagnosis
venous pulse with decompensated heart failure. A history of trauma should prompt suspicion of cardiac
tamponade, valvular disturbance, myocardial puncture, hemorrhage, or tension pneumothorax. Tracheal
deviation suggests tension pneumothorax. A murmur may indicate a valvular cause of compromise,
which might lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Pulmonary auscultation may reveal bilateral crepitations
in decompensated heart failure, absent air entry in pneumothorax, or signs of underlying pulmonary
disease. Neurologic exam may reveal focal signs suggestive of intracranial pathology. Endotracheal
intubation or a supraglottic airway device may be considered during resuscitation, particularly if there is
difficulty achieving ventilation with a bag-mask device.
The patient’s medical, family, and medication history should be reviewed at the earliest opportunity to
identify possible causes. Clues that may be identified include:
• Preceding symptoms: chest pain may indicate myocardial ischemia or pulmonary embolism.
Syncopal episodes may indicate structural heart disease or pre-existing arrhythmias. Palpitations
may indicate pre-existing arrhythmias. One study found that among individuals with symptomatic
OHCA, chest pain and dyspnea in men, and dyspnea in women, were the most common symptoms
and had a moderate association with sudden cardiac arrest when compared with a control group of
individuals who also called emergency services.[50]
• Past medical history: potential causes include coronary artery disease (CAD) and its associated
risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, obesity), left
ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, structural heart disease,
use of illicit substances, medications (including those that cause QT prolongation or diuretics that
cause electrolyte disturbances), kidney disease (which may lead to hyperkalemia), and history of
eating disorders (which may contribute to hypokalemia and/or hypophosphatemia).[43] Risk factors
for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) may increase the suspicion of PE
as the etiology; these include prior DVT/PE, unilateral calf swelling, active cancer, recent surgery,
recent immobilization, pregnancy, coagulopathy, or oral contraception use. 
• Family history of sudden cardiac arrest: may be due to familial QT-interval prolongation syndromes
or familial cardiomyopathies. A family history of CAD may also be present.
Investigations
Several tests should be considered during cardiac arrest to assess the underlying cause and the condition
of the patient:
• Patients require continuous cardiac monitoring to assess rhythm.
• A CBC should be performed to look for signs of hemorrhage (e.g., low hematocrit), which may
cause hypovolemia. An acute bleed may not show up, however, if hemodilution has not yet
occurred.
• Serum electrolytes should be checked for abnormalities, particularly hyper- or hypokalemia; these
may occur as either a cause or consequence of cardiac arrest.
• Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement is essential to assess acid-base status and may reveal
respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis with renal compensation, metabolic
acidosis with respiratory compensation, mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis, or hyperkalemia.
Respiratory and metabolic parameters should be optimized as necessary to normalize acid-base
status. Abnormal results may be a result of sudden cardiac arrest itself rather than the underlying
cause.

Cardiac arrest Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Cardiac biomarkers may be measured. However, elevations in markers of myocardial infarction (MI)
may be a result of sudden cardiac arrest and do not necessarily mean that the underlying cause
was an MI.
• Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) may be used as an adjunct for patient evaluation during cardiac
arrest, so long as it does not interfere with standard cardiac arrest treatments.[1] [51] International
Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines recommend against its routine use, but suggest
that if it can be performed by experienced staff without interrupting CPR, it can be used to look
for a specific suspected reversible cause.[52] POCUS can be used to identify the presence or
absence of cardiac activity, and can also identify features of cardiac tamponade, pneumothorax,
hemorrhage, or pulmonary embolism. As these are potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest,
this could alter subsequent management. However, there is evidence that the use of POCUS in
cardiac arrest prolongs the length of interruption of CPR during pulse checks.[52] [53] [54]
Further tests should be considered after achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC):
• An ECG should be performed immediately after ROSC, then subsequently to assess for evolving
changes. Abnormalities that may be seen include prolonged QT interval, ST-segment or T-wave
changes (indicating ischemia or infarction in the event of ST-segment elevation), conduction
abnormalities, ventricular hypertrophy, QRS prolongation in V1 through V3 and/or epsilon waves
in cardiomyopathy, and T-wave inversion in V1 through V3 in arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia (ARVD). Ambulatory ECG monitoring can be useful to capture sporadic events, either
by continuous monitoring (Holter recording) over 24-48 hours, or using patient-activated ECG
recorders (mobile health or smart phone technology) for infrequent events.[7]
• Coronary angiography should be considered after achieving ROSC, as coronary disease is a
predisposing factor for sudden cardiac arrest. In patients with ST-elevation MI (STEMI) on ECG,
emergency coronary angiography, with or without percutaneous coronary intervention should be
performed.[7] [52] [55] Emergency coronary angiography is also reasonable for select patients
with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation, including those with hemodynamic/
electrical instability or signs of ongoing ischemia.[1] However, several randomized controlled trials
in patients without signs of STEMI have shown no benefit in clinical outcomes for early coronary
angiography, compared with delayed angiography.[7] [56] [57] International Liaison Committee on
Resuscitation consensus recommendations suggest that in patients without signs of STEMI, either
early or delayed coronary angiography is reasonable.[52] American Heart Association guidelines
do not recommend emergency coronary angiography over delayed angiography in patients with
ROSC in the absence of ST elevation, shock, electrical instability, signs of significant myocardial
damage, or ongoing ischemia.[55] PCI should only be performed in patients with culprit lesions on
coronary angiography. Unnecessary PCI of stable lesions should be avoided in the early phase
after OHCA, given the absence of benefit and increased risk of hemorrhagic complications and
stent thrombosis in the setting of sudden cardiac arrest.[58] [59]
• Echocardiography can be used to assess cardiac contractility and check for structural
abnormalities, valvular disorders and for evidence of tamponade. Left ventricular function should
also be assessed 48 hours after ROSC, after the period of post-arrest myocardial stunning.[60]
A normal imaging study in patients with ventricular arrhythmia suggests a primary electrical
disorder.[7]
• Exercise stress testing is useful for diagnosing and measuring response to treatment in patients
with adrenergic-dependent rhythm disturbances, such as exercise-induced idiopathic monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia (VT) or polymorphic VT. The 4-minute recovery QT interval after exercise
testing can contribute to the diagnosis of long QT syndrome.[7] [61]

Cardiac arrest Diagnosis
• Chest x-ray may reveal pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or other disorders of the lungs. The
thoracic cage may show causes of, or complications from, cardiac arrest. Endotracheal tube
placement should be evaluated if the patient is intubated.
• A toxicology screen may be considered to rule out illicit substances that may predispose to
ventricular arrhythmia.
• Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is used to identify ARVD or other primary cardiomyopathies.
It is the preferred test to identify these disorders and should be done if other causes of sudden
cardiac arrest are not discovered.
• Coronary computed tomography angiography can be used to rule out coronary artery stenosis in
patients who have a low probability of coronary artery disease.[7]
• Signal-averaged ECG: may also be used to identify ARVD if other causes of sudden cardiac arrest
are not discovered. Late potentials suggest the diagnosis.[7]
• Electrophysiologic studies: evaluation of primary arrhythmia or conduction abnormalities should be
considered if no other cause of sudden cardiac arrest is found, or if there is potential for ablation
of an arrhythmogenic source in patients with prior MI. Electrophysiologic studies will delineate the
arrhythmogenic focus.[7] [62] [63]
• Screening of family members of patients with suspected or confirmed heritable syndromes, such as
Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, and dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.[7]
• Provocative tests can also be considered, such as sodium channel blocker testing for Brugada
syndrome and adenosine testing to exclude latent pre-excitation.[7]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
patient unresponsive (common)
• Patient will be unresponsive. Airway, breathing, and circulation should be assessed.
absence of normal breathing (common)
• May have absent breathing or agonal respiration.
absence of circulation (common)
• Does not have a pulse.
cardiac rhythm disturbance (common)
• Possibilities include ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical
activity, or asystole.
Risk factors
Strong
coronary artery disease (CAD)
• The most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest is CAD.[12] Transitively, the risk factors for
myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease also increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest.

Cardiac arrest Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
However, given that many people with CAD do not have cardiac arrest, the degree of association of
each of these risk factors with sudden cardiac arrest is unsubstantiated.[27]
left ventricular dysfunction
• Strongly associated with sudden cardiac arrest, whether it is the result of ischemic heart disease or
nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.[28] This is borne out by studies showing that the implantation
of a defibrillator, without a history of sudden cardiac arrest, markedly reduces the rate of death due to
ventricular arrhythmia in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.[29]
age
• Advanced age is strongly associated with sudden cardiac death.[7] After infancy, the rate of sudden
cardiac death increases exponentially with age.
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
• Disordered myofibrils, myocardial scarring, and ischemia all likely serve as an arrhythmic substrate in
patients with HCM.[30] Though the overall risk of sudden cardiac arrest in these patients is low, HCM
is the number one cardiovascular cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people.[31]
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)
• Genetic disorder in which the right ventricular myocardium (and sometimes the left ventricular
myocardium) is replaced by a fibro-fatty infiltrate. Retrospective case series in patients with ARVD
estimate that almost one quarter of patients have sudden cardiac death as their presenting feature,
usually before the fourth decade of life.[32]
long QT syndrome (LQTS)
• Due to either the inheritance of dysfunctional cardiac ion channels or an acquired disorder due
to various different medications.[24] Untreated, patients with the congenital LQTS are reported to
have a risk of sudden cardiac arrest of up to 60% at 10 years.[33] The risk is markedly decreased in
patients on beta-blocker treatment. High-risk features include a QT interval >500 milliseconds, certain
mutations, female gender, and history of syncope.[34]
medications that prolong the QT interval or cause electrolyte disturbances
• Certain medications may increase risk for prolongation of the QT interval. These include quinidine,
procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, phenothiazines, and tricyclic
antidepressants.  [CredibleMeds: drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/
healthcare-providers)
• Diuretic use may increase risk of electrolyte disturbances.
acute medical or surgical emergency
• Potential causes of cardiac arrest include massive pulmonary embolism (PE), hypoxia, hypovolemia,
hemorrhagic shock, hyper- or hypokalemia, hydrogen ion excess (acidosis), hypothermia, hypo- or
hyperglycemia, trauma, tension pneumothorax, thrombus (PE, myocardial infarction), toxins (e.g., in
renal failure or drug intoxication), cardiac tamponade, valvular disturbance, myocardial puncture, and
intracranial pathology.
poisoning
• Opioid overdose is the leading cause of cardiac arrest due to poisoning in North America.[35] Rates
of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests due to opioid use have been increasing in recent years with the

rising use of synthetic opioids (particularly fentanyl).[36] [37] Opioids directly lead to respiratory
depression and hypoxia-induced cardiac arrest. Stimulants such as cocaine may also increase the
risk of arrhythmia or ischemia leading to cardiac arrest. Other substances that can lead to cardiac
arrest in overdose include benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cyanide,
digoxin and related cardiac glycosides, local anesthetics, methemoglobinemia, organophosphates and
carbamates, sodium channel antagonists, and sympathomimetics.[35]
Weak
Brugada syndrome
• Characterized electrocardiographically by a pseudo-right bundle branch block pattern and ST-
segment elevations in leads V1 through V3.[38] In a meta-analysis of 24 studies, prevalence was
estimated at 0.4% worldwide.[39] The disorder is thought to be due to the autosomal dominant
SCN5A gene mutation, which encodes a dysfunctional cardiac sodium channel and predisposes to
arrhythmia, though the known mutations in this gene are found in only 18% to 30% of patients with the
syndrome.[40]
• Notably, the syndrome is estimated to cause up to 4% of sudden cardiac arrest overall, and up to 20%
of sudden cardiac arrest in patients without structural heart disease.[40]
valvular heart disease
• Risk of acute or chronic heart failure with history of valvular heart disease; during evaluation, specific
attention should be paid to aortic and mitral stenosis.
smoking
• Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest.[41] This may be due
to the nicotine-mediated effects of increased myocardial oxygen demand, induction of catecholamine
release, coronary vasospasm, and related arrhythmogenicity.[42]
history of eating disorders
• Due to either malnutrition or emesis, eating disorders may result in electrolyte abnormalities (such as
hypokalemia and/or hypophosphatemia) that contribute to ventricular arrhythmia or cardiac failure.[43]

arrest treatments.[1] [51] International Liaison Committee on
Resuscitation guidelines recommend against its routine use, but
suggest that if it can be performed by experienced staff without
interrupting CPR, it can be used to look for a specific suspected
reversible cause.[52] POCUS can be used to identify the presence or
absence of cardiac activity, and can also identify features of cardiac
tamponade, pneumothorax, hemorrhage, or pulmonary embolism.
As these are potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest, this could
alter subsequent management. However, there is evidence that the
use of POCUS in cardiac arrest prolongs the length of interruption of
CPR during pulse checks.[52] [53] [54]

• An ECG should be performed immediately after return of
spontaneous circulation, then subsequently to assess for evolving

sporadic events, either by continuous monitoring (Holter recording)
over 24-48 hours, or patient-activated ECG recorders (mobile health
or smart phone technology) for infrequent events.[7]

coronary angiography
• Consider after achieving return of spontaneous circulation, as
coronary artery disease is a predisposing factor for sudden cardiac
arrest. In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on
ECG, emergency coronary angiography with or without percutaneous
coronary intervention, should be performed.[1] [7] [52] Emergency
coronary angiography, is also reasonable for select patients with
suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation, including
those with hemodynamic/electrical instability or signs of ongoing
ischemia.[1] However, several randomized controlled trials in patients
without signs of STEMI have shown no benefit in clinical outcomes
for early coronary angiography compared to delayed angiography.[7]
[56] [57] International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation consensus
recommendations suggest that in patients without signs of STEMI,
either early or delayed coronary angiography is reasonable.[52] PCI
should only be performed in patients with culprit lesions on coronary
angiography. Unnecessary PCI of stable lesions should be avoided in
the early phase after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, given the absence
of benefit and increased risk of hemorrhagic complications and stent
thrombosis in the setting of sudden cardiac arrest.[58][59]

Cardiac arrest Diagnosis
Screening for familial causes of sudden cardiac arrest, including congenital long QT syndrome and Brugada
syndrome, is offered to first- and second-degree relatives of patients with sudden cardiac arrest.[65]
Measures found useful in this situation include a general cardiologic exam consisting of a careful history and
physical exam, ECG, echocardiogram, Holter monitoring, and stress testing.[66] Further evaluation including
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiologic testing can be performed when indicated.[62] In
addition, screening for genetic diseases associated with sudden cardiac arrest in family members has been
demonstrated to be useful at centers experienced with inherited cardiac diseases.

Cardiac arrest Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The main goal of treatment in sudden cardiac arrest is to achieve a return of spontaneous (as opposed to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]-mediated) circulation.[68] The algorithm of basic life support (BLS) and
advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) provided by the American Heart Association (AHA) gives a systematic
approach to the treatment of sudden cardiac arrest.[1] The methods vary slightly based on the underlying
rhythm and cause of sudden cardiac arrest, but all rely on immediate attention to stabilizing the patient's
respiratory status, addressing airway management as needed, and providing medications and other life-
saving treatments aimed at correcting the unstable rhythm, as well as treating the underlying cause, all the
while providing compressions to preserve vital organ perfusion.
After activation of emergency medical services, the first approach to sudden cardiac arrest is BLS, providing
compressions (first priority), assessing the airway, and giving breaths. This C-A-B priority recommendation
by the AHA for adults is a change in the guidelines from the A-B-C priority taught historically, in order to
emphasize the importance of providing timely chest compressions.[1] [69] [70] Untrained lay-rescuers should
perform compression-only CPR.[1] For rescuers trained in CPR using chest compressions and ventilation, it
is reasonable to provide rescue breaths in addition to compressions.[1] [52]  In cases where it is suspected
that opioid overdose has caused the cardiac arrest, naloxone should be administered.[37] Patients who
require further treatment are then given ACLS by trained providers.[1]
At any given point in the provision of ACLS, the rhythm may change from pulseless ventricular tachycardia
(VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) to pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole, or vice versa. In such an event,
the appropriate ACLS algorithm for the new rhythm should be followed.
Epinephrine is recommended for both shockable and nonshockable rhythms.[1][51] [55] The use of
epinephrine during cardiac arrest has been shown to increase the rate of achieving return of spontaneous
circulation (ROSC) and to increase short-term survival.[71] [72] [73] [74] However, epinephrine use during
cardiac arrest has not been shown to lead to significantly improved neurologic outcomes, and may lead
to higher rates of severe neurologic impairment among survivors.[71] [72] [73] [74] One large randomized
controlled trial (PARAMEDIC2) found no significant difference in the proportion of patients surviving to
discharge with favorable neurologic outcome.[71]
While performing ACLS, the care team will assess for and treat any suspected reversible causes of cardiac
arrest. If poisoning is suspected or confirmed, timely consult with a toxicologist or regional poison center
should be undertaken to facilitate rapid and effective therapy. Treatment of cardiac arrest and life-threatening
toxicity due to poisoning often requires specialized treatments that most clinicians do not use frequently,
such as antidotes and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, in addition to effective basic and
advanced life support. Guidelines have been published for the specific management of cardiac arrest due to
critical poisoning from benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, cyanide, digoxin
and related cardiac glycosides, local anesthetics, methemoglobinemia, opioids, organophosphates and
carbamates, sodium channel antagonists, and sympathomimetics.[35]
US guidelines published during the COVID-19 pandemic advise that chest compressions or defibrillation
should not be delayed for providers to don personal protective equipment (PPE), but that initial resuscitation
personnel should be relieved by providers wearing appropriate PPE as soon as possible.[75] If the patient
cannot be placed supine, cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be provided in the prone position, particularly if
the patient has advanced airway and circulatory support.[76]

Cardiac arrest Management
UK guidance advises that for those working in healthcare settings, the use of FFP3 masks or respirators
and eye protection is recommended when performing chest compressions for patients with suspected or
confirmed COVID-19. PPE should be donned as swiftly as possible to avoid any delays in treatment.[77]
Shockable rhythms (pulseless VT and VF)
In the setting of pulseless VT/VF, the initial management is of BLS as described above (C-A-B method).
Early provision of CPR, including compression-only CPR, by bystanders in out-of-hospital arrest
increases the rate of survival.[7] [78] [79] 
Laypeople in the US initiated CPR in 40% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) in 2022.[2] Work has
shown that compression-only resuscitation by bystanders for OHCA is equally, if not more, efficient in
providing life-saving therapy, compared with conventional CPR with rescue breaths.[1] [80] In a survey
of 9022 people in the US in 2015, the prevalence of reported current training in CPR was 18%, and the
prevalence of having CPR training at some point was 65%. The rates were lower in Hispanic/Latino
people, older people, people with less formal education, and lower-income groups.[81] Research supports
increasing the availability of public-access defibrillators and community training in BLS methods, including
training for schoolchildren.[7] [82] BLS training should be particularly encouraged for likely rescuers of
people at high risk of OHCA, such as those with cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, and drug-use
disorder.[52] In Sweden, bystander CPR increased from 30.9% to 82.2% between 1990 and 2020, likely
due to a 40-year campaign to educate the population about CPR.[83]
ACLS is commenced when trained providers arrive. If spontaneous circulation is not restored and a
shockable rhythm is identified, one shock should be delivered (120-200 J for biphasic or 360 J for
monophasic) followed by 5 cycles (2 minutes) of CPR.[1] Intravenous (preferred) or intraosseous access
is obtained without interrupting CPR.[1] 
The pulse and rhythm are again assessed and, if the patient remains in pulseless VT/VF, another
equivalent or higher-energy shock is delivered and epinephrine given, followed by 5 cycles (2 minutes)
of CPR.[1] [55] If the rhythm is still pulseless VT/VF, another shock is delivered along with amiodarone
or lidocaine, and CPR is continued for 5 cycles (2 minutes). If the patient remains in a shockable rhythm,
the algorithm restarts at the stage of epinephrine administration. This cycle continues until spontaneous
circulation is achieved or resuscitative measures are terminated.
In situations of witnessed arrest, electrical defibrillation should be attempted as soon as possible, not
necessarily after 5 cycles (2 minutes) of CPR.[1] Due to the importance of prompt defibrillation, the use
of "public access defibrillation" by lay-rescuers using automatic external defibrillators has gained favor
and been found to increase the rate of sudden cardiac arrest patients surviving to hospital discharge.[7]
[85] [86] Lay-rescuer public access defibrillation has been shown to have a higher impact on survival than
defibrillation by emergency dispatched professional first responders.[87]
The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation suggest that use of a double sequential
defibrillation strategy or vector change defibrillation strategy may be considered for adults who remain in
pulseless VT/VF after 3 or more consecutive shocks (this is a weak recommendation, based on very low
certainty evidence).[88] If a double sequential defibrillation strategy is used, it is good practice for one
single operator to activate the defibrillators in sequence.[88]
In patients with sudden cardiac arrest due to torsades de pointes, giving magnesium may restore a
perfusing cardiac rhythm.[85] [89]

MANAGEMENT
Nonshockable rhythms (PEA and asystole)
In the setting of PEA/asystole, the initial provision is of BLS as described above (C-A-B method).
ACLS is commenced when trained providers arrive. If spontaneous circulation is not restored and a
nonshockable rhythm is identified, 5 cycles (2 minutes) of CPR are provided.[1] Intravenous (preferred)
or intraosseous access is obtained without interrupting CPR, and epinephrine (adrenaline) is given as
soon as possible and every 3-5 minutes thereafter. The pulse and rhythm are assessed after every 5
cycles (2 minutes) of CPR, and if a pulseless nonshockable rhythm remains, CPR is continued.[1] This
cycle of giving CPR and epinephrine continues until spontaneous circulation is attained or resuscitation is
terminated. In addition, empiric treatment for likely reversible causes may be considered, such as calcium
bicarbonate for hyperkalemia in patients with a history of renal failure. There is no evidence to suggest
that transcutaneous pacing should be used in patients with asystolic arrest.[90]
Postresuscitation care
If ROSC is achieved, postresuscitation care should be instigated immediately. This involves continued
monitoring, organ support, correction of electrolyte imbalances and acidosis, and safe transfer to a critical
care environment. A thorough search for potential etiologies should be conducted, and risk factors for
sudden cardiac arrest should be modified or treated.
A 12-lead ECG is recommended immediately after ROSC to determine whether signs of ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI) are present.[1] In patients with STEMI, emergency coronary angiography,
with or without percutaneous coronary intervention, should be performed.[55] Emergency coronary
angiography is also reasonable for select patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST
elevation, including those with hemodynamic/electrical instability or signs of ongoing ischemia.[55] It is not
recommended over delayed angiography in patients with ROSC in the absence of ST elevation, shock,
electrical instability, signs of significant myocardial damage, or ongoing ischemia.[55]
Anoxic brain injury is a frequent complication of sudden cardiac arrest. A systematic review of the
literature demonstrates that targeted temperature management (TTM) protocols improve survival and
neurologic outcome following resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest, with guidelines continuing to
support their use.[1] [91] The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that all patients unable
to follow commands (i.e., are comatose) receive treatment that includes temperature control, regardless
of their arrest location or presenting rhythm.[55] There is a range for the target temperature, with more
recent evidence suggesting that maintaining normothermia (i.e., avoidance of fever) may be equivalent
to targeting hypothermia. One large randomized controlled trial (TTM2) which studied patients with
coma after OHCA found no difference in 6 month survival or neurologic outcome in patients treated with
hypothermia (target temperature of 91.4°F [33°C]) compared with normothermia (target temperature
≤99.5°F [≤37.5°C]).[92] An earlier trial (TTM) found that a targeted temperature of 91.4°F (33°C)
conferred no benefit compared with 96.8°F (36°C).[93]
For comatose adult patients with ROSC, AHA guidelines recommend targeting a temperature between
89.6°F and 99.5°F (32°C and 37.5°C) for at least 24 hours, and avoiding fever after the initial
temperature control phase.[55] [94] The 2024 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation
guidelines recommend actively preventing fever by targeting a temperature of ≤99.5°F (≤37.5°C) for
36-72 hours, commenting that the benefits of targeting hypothermia between 89.6°F and 93.2°F (32°C
and 34°C) in selected subpopulations of patients remain uncertain.[88] European guidelines recommend
targeting a temperature between 89.6°F and 96.8°F (32°C and 36°C).[95]

Cardiac arrest Management
TTM has three phases: induction, maintenance, and rewarming. Induction and/or maintenance can be
achieved by:[95]
• Simple ice packs with or without wet towels
• Cooling blankets or pads
• Water- or air-circulating blankets
• Water-circulating gel-coated pads
• Transnasal evaporative cooling
• Intravascular heat exchanger
• Extracorporeal circulation.
Routine prehospital cooling of patients after ROSC with rapid infusion of cold intravenous fluids is not
recommended.[1] [52] [95]
Rewarming should be achieved slowly (0.45°F to 0.90°F [0.25°C to 0.50°C] of rewarming per hour) to
avoid rebound hyperthermia, which is associated with worse neurologic outcomes.[95]
There is evidence that patients who receive postresuscitation care at specialized centers have higher
rates of neurologically intact survival, suggesting that postresuscitative treatment should ideally be
performed in this setting.[96] [97] Cardiac arrest centers have been shown to display higher coherence
with guidelines compared with noncardiac arrest centers.[98] In-patient neurologic rehabilitation may
be helpful for survivors who have suffered hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, although specific guidelines
and evidence are lacking in this patient population.[95] Many patients will also be eligible for cardiac
rehabilitation programs, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospital
admissions, and improve quality of life. They are mostly generic programs, in which patients with different
cardiac diseases, for example, post acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or post-cardiac surgery,
can participate. They involve exercise training, risk factor management, lifestyle advice, education, and
psychological support.[95]
Long-term management focuses primarily on prevention of recurrence. Patients should abstain from
toxic substances. Use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) has shown a significant reduction
in mortality compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac
arrest.[7] [99]
Termination of resuscitation
This is an ethically challenging issue when treating patients for whom spontaneous circulation does not
return in a timely fashion. There is no single factor that can determine when to terminate resuscitative
efforts; rather it should be a decision of clinical judgment and respect for human dignity.
In prehospital settings where Basic Life Support (BLS) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are providing
care, and Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers are not available or will be significantly delayed,
resuscitation may be terminated based on a validated rule if all of the following criteria are met:[1] [100]
[101]
• EMS did not witness the arrest
• The patient had no ROSC before transport
• No shock was administered before transport.
In the prehospital setting where ALS EMS are providing care, resuscitation may be terminated based on a
validated rule if all of the following criteria are met:[1]

• Arrest was not witnessed
• No bystander CPR was provided
• The patient had no ROSC before transport
• No shock was administered before transport.
In a meta-analysis, the BLS and ALS termination of resuscitation rules both had a low miss-rate
(proportion recommended termination of resuscitation who nevertheless survived to discharge) of 0.13%
and 0.01% respectively.[102]
Resuscitative measures should be terminated if there is documentation that the patient has a valid “do
not resuscitate” order. Terminating resuscitative measures may also be considered on the basis of the
following parameters:[103]
• Delayed initiation of CPR in unwitnessed cardiac arrest
• Unsuccessful resuscitation after 20 minutes of ACLS guideline-directed therapy
• Conditions that compromise the safety of the emergency care providers.
[Advanced life support algorithm] (https://staticweb.bmj.com/BP/CardiacArrest/283-210120image.pdf)
After sudden OHCA with unsuccessful resuscitation, organ donation may be considered, but is commonly
overlooked. Data from a single-center study in the UK suggest that only 39% of patients who did
not recover after OHCA were referred for organ donation. Of those who were referred, consent was
obtained in only 68%, and 25% actually went on to donate an average of 1.9 organs per patient.[106]
 The AHA recommends that organ donation is considered in all resuscitated patients who meet the
neurologic criteria for death or before planned withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.[55] A review by the
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation found that numerous barriers and logistical challenges
exist to setting up systems that support organ donation after cardiac arrest; the authors recommend
that all health systems should develop, implement, and evaluate protocols designed to optimize organ
donation opportunities in this situation.[107]

for pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)/
ventricular fibrillation (VF) that is unresponsive
to defibrillation.[1] [55] There is evidence that
both amiodarone and lidocaine independently
increase the rate of return of spontaneous

refractory to defibrillation, but ultimately lead to
no significant difference in the rate of survival to
hospital discharge.[111]

return of spontaneous circulation
1st postresuscitation care
» Should be instigated immediately and involves
continued monitoring, organ support, correction
of electrolyte imbalances and acidosis, safe
transfer to a critical care environment, and
identification and correction of risk factors and
underlying causes.
» A 12-lead ECG is recommended immediately
after return of spontaneous circulation to
determine whether signs of ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI) are present.[1]
In patients with STEMI, emergency coronary
angiography, with or without percutaneous
coronary intervention, should be performed.[55]
 Emergency coronary angiography is also
reasonable for select patients with suspected
acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation,
including those with hemodynamic/electrical
instability or signs of ongoing ischemia.[55] It
is not recommended over delayed angiography
in patients with ROSC in the absence of ST
elevation, shock, electrical instability, signs
of significant myocardial damage, or ongoing
ischemia.[55]
» Anoxic brain injury is a frequent complication
of sudden cardiac arrest. One systematic
review of the literature demonstrates that
targeted temperature management (TTM)
protocols improve survival and neurologic
outcome following resuscitation from sudden
cardiac arrest, with guidelines continuing to
support their use.[1] [91] The American Heart
Association (AHA) recommends that all patients
unable to follow commands (i.e., are comatose)
receive treatment that includes temperature
control, regardless of their arrest location or
presenting rhythm.[55] There is a range of
target temperature, with more recent evidence
suggesting that maintaining normothermia
(i.e., avoidance of fever) may be equivalent to
targeting hypothermia. One large randomized
controlled trial (TTM2) which studied patients
with coma after OHCA found no difference
in 6 month survival or neurologic outcome
in patients treated with hypothermia (target
temperature of 91.4°F [33°C]) compared with
normothermia (target temperature ≤99.5°F
[≤37.5°C]).[92] An earlier trial (TTM) found
that a targeted temperature of 91.4°F (33°C)
conferred no benefit compared with 96.8°F
(36°C).[93]

» For comatose adult patients with return
of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), AHA
guidelines recommend targeting a temperature
between 89.6°F and 99.5°F (32°C and 37.5°C)
for at least 24 hours, and avoiding fever after
the initial temperature control phase.[55] [94]
 The 2024 International Liaison Committee on
Resuscitation guidelines recommend actively
preventing fever by targeting a temperature of
≤99.5°F (≤37.5°C) for 36-72 hours, commenting
that the benefits of targeting hypothermia
between 89.6°F and 93.2°F (32°C and 34°C)
in selected subpopulations of patients remains
uncertain.[52] European guidelines recommend
targeting a temperature between 89.6°F and
96.8°F (32°C and 36°C).[95]
» TTM has 3 phases: induction, maintenance,
and rewarming. Induction and/or maintenance
can be achieved by: simple ice packs with
or without wet towels, cooling blankets or
pads, water- or air-circulating blankets, water-
circulating gel-coated pads, transnasal
evaporative cooling, intravascular heat
exchanger, extracorporeal circulation.[95]
» Routine prehospital cooling of patients
after return of spontaneous circulation with
rapid infusion of cold intravenous fluids is not
recommended.[1] [52] [95]
» Rewarming should be achieved slowly (0.45°F
to 0.90°F [0.25°C to 0.50°C] of rewarming per
hour) to avoid rebound hyperthermia, which is
associated with worse neurologic outcomes.[95]
» There is evidence that patients who receive
post-resuscitation care at specialized centers
have higher rates of neurologically intact
survival, suggesting that post-resuscitative
treatment should ideally be performed in this
setting.[96] [97] Cardiac arrest centers have
been shown to display higher coherence with
guidelines compared with noncardiac arrest
centers.[98]
» In-patient neurologic rehabilitation may
be helpful for survivors who have suffered
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, although specific
guidelines and evidence are lacking in this
patient population.[95] Many patients will also be
eligible for cardiac rehabilitation programs, which
have been shown to reduce cardiovascular
mortality and hospital admissions, and improve
quality of life. They are mostly generic programs,
in which patients with different cardiac diseases
(e.g., post acute coronary syndrome, heart
failure, or post cardiac surgery), can participate.

They involve exercise training, risk factor
management, lifestyle advice, education, and
psychological support.[95]
» Long-term management focuses primarily on
prevention of recurrence. Patients should abstain
from toxic substances. Use of implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) has shown a
significant reduction in mortality compared with
antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the secondary
prevention of sudden cardiac arrest.[7] [99]
no return of spontaneous circulation
1st continue or consider termination of
resuscitation
» The decision to terminate resuscitation is
an ethically challenging issue when treating
patients for whom spontaneous circulation
does not return in a timely fashion. There is
no single factor that can determine when to
terminate resuscitative efforts; rather it should
be a decision of clinical judgment and respect
for human dignity. In prehospital settings
where Basic Life Support (BLS) Emergency
Medical Services (EMS) are providing care,
and Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers
are not available or will be significantly delayed,
resuscitation may be terminated based on a
validated rule if all of the following criteria are
met: EMS did not witness the arrest; the patient
had no ROSC before transport; and no shock
was administered before transport.[1] [100] [101]
» In the prehospital setting where ALS EMS are
providing care, resuscitation may be terminated
based on a validated rule if all of the following
criteria are met: arrest was not witnessed; no
bystander CPR was provided; the patient had
no ROSC before transport; and no shock was
administered before transport.[1]
» Resuscitative measures should be terminated
if there is documentation that the patient has a
valid “do not resuscitate” order. Termination of
resuscitative measures may also be considered
on the basis of the following parameters: delayed
initiation of CPR in unwitnessed cardiac arrest,
unsuccessful resuscitation after 20 minutes of
advanced cardiac life support guideline-directed
therapy, or conditions that compromise the
safety of the emergency care providers.

Emerging
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may be an option to increase survival after out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that patients
treated with early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had increased survival rates compared with those
receiving standard care; however the trial was small and was stopped early.[112] A multicenter RCT of 160
patients found that ECPR and conventional CPR had similar effects on survival with a favorable neurologic
outcome.[113] It is uncertain which patients should be selected to receive ECPR. It also is not clear whether
transporting a larger number of patients in cardiac arrest to rapid triage for extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation treatment might adversely impact overall survival rates for OHCA, due to the association of intra-
arrest transport with worse outcomes.[52] [112] In 2022, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine
stated there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend use of ECPR over standard advanced cardiac
life support, whereas the American Heart Association guidelines and 2024 International Liaison Committee
on Resuscitation consensus offer a weak recommendation that ECPR can be considered as rescue therapy
in select patients when conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation methods are failing, in settings in which
this can be implemented.[55] [88][112] [114]
Primary prevention
Since coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common cause of cardiac arrest, management of CAD risk factors
is important in the primary prevention of cardiac arrest. This may include treatment of hypertension, diabetes,
dyslipidemia, and general lifestyle interventions such as healthy diet and regular exercise. Natriuretic
peptides may have a role in identifying people at greater risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the general
population or patients with CAD.[7]
Several randomized controlled trials and prospective registries have found a mortality reduction when
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is used for the primary prevention of SCD in heart failure
patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of <35%.[7]
ICD is recommended in the following cases (but note that specific indications vary in different regions/
countries; consult guidelines for full details):
1. Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and ejection fraction ≤30%.[44] [45][46]
2. Patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association class II or greater, congestive
heart failure, and ejection fraction ≤35%.[29] [45] [46]
3. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and two or more of the following risk factors:
syncope, left ventricular thickness >3 cm, abnormal blood pressure response to exercise
(hypotension), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and family history of SCD. Patients with only
1 risk factor should be counseled and considered on a case-by-case basis.[30]
4. Patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) and extensive disease of the right
ventricle, involvement of the left ventricle, history of syncope, or family history of sudden cardiac
arrest.
5. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) who have a history of cardiac arrest, are
symptomatic on beta-blocker therapy and genotype-specific therapies, or who are asymptomatic but
have a high-risk profile (based on the 1-2-3 LQTS Risk Calculator).[7]
6. Patients with Brugada syndrome and a history of syncope with ST-segment elevations in leads V1
through V3 or documented VT.[40]
ICDs should only be considered in patients who are expected to survive for more than one year of good
quality life.[7] [45]
In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (<40%), guideline-directed medical therapy is
recommended to reduce SCD (and all-cause mortality).[45] [46] This may include a beta-blocker, aldosterone
antagonist, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitor
(ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [ARNi]).
Antiarrhythmics have been studied for prevention of SCD.[47] In patients at high risk for SCD, amiodarone

no intervention.[48]
Screening for athletes shows potential to identify those at risk for cardiovascular disease before onset of
symptoms. In younger athletes, a combination of medical history, physical examination and ECG appears
effective in identifying cardiovascular disease by identifying relevant symptoms, such as exertional syncope,
or ECG abnormalities. Older athletes can be evaluated using risk score systems, such as European Society
of Cardiology SCORE2.[7]
In cases of SCD, the underlying cause should be investigated and autopsy considered, particularly in
the young (under 50 years old). Autopsy can identify conditions such as cardiomyopathy and premature
CAD. When possible genetic cardiac disease is identified, first-degree relatives should be assessed in a
specialized cardiology clinic and genetic testing may be considered. In autopsy-negative cases, targeted
post-mortem genetic testing can identify a mutation in up to one-third of cases.[7]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for the primary prevention of SCD taken from the
2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and the

Registry data suggest that, owing to delays relating
to organ transplantation wait lists, a substantial
minority of patients will die whilst awaiting cardiac
transplantation; the presence of an ICD at listing is
associated with a reduced relative risk reduction in
mortality.
With a lamin A/C cardiomyopathy and ≥2 risk factors for SCD
Intervention Goal
ICD can be beneficial
Risk factors for SCD in people with a lamin A/C
cardiomyopathy include:
• Nonsustained VT
• LVEF <45%
• Nonmissense mutation
• Male sex
Only consider offering an ICD to patients who are
expected to survive for more than one year of good
quality life.
Reduced risk of SCD
Although the goal is a reduction in risk of SCD and
all-cause mortality, no studies have tested the effect
of the ICD on long-term survival.
With hemodynamically unstable VT or stable sustained VT not due to reversible cause
Intervention Goal
ICD is recommended; consider amiodarone
for those ineligible for an ICD
Use of an ICD is recommended for those who are
expected to survive for more than one year of good
quality life.
In those who are ineligible for an ICD (e.g., due to
limited life-expectancy or other factors) amiodarone
may be considered for prevention of SCD.

Cardiac arrest Management
MANAGEMENT
With syncope due to presumed VA; without other indication for ICD
Intervention Goal
Consider ICD or electrophysiological study
for risk stratification for SCD
In patients with NICM who experience syncope
presumed to be due to VA and who do not meet
indications for a primary prevention ICD, an ICD or
an electrophysiological study for risk stratification for
SCD can be beneficial if the patient is expected to
survive for more than one year of good quality life.
Electrophysiological testing may help determine
if syncope is arrhythmogenic (around 30-40% of
patients); however based on the available data
many experts are uncomfortable withholding an
ICD from patients with NICM who experience
syncope potentially due to a VA even if the
electrophysiological study shows no inducible
sustained VT.
Reduced risk of SCD
With arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
For those with VA, treatment with a beta-blocker, to
reduce the risk of clinically relevant arrhythmias, is
reasonable.
An ICD is recommended for those with the following
additional markers of increased risk of SCD:
• Sustained VT
• Significant ventricular dysfunction with right
ventricular ejection fraction or LVEF ≤35%
• Resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest (note that
this indication is included for completeness
but falls under secondary rather than primary
prevention)
An ICD may be reasonable for those with syncope
presumed due to a VA.
Only consider offering an ICD to patients who are
expected to survive for more than one year of good
quality life.
Prevention of adverse cardiac events
including VT and SCD
Ambulatory monitoring to assess VA burden and
adequacy in those on beta-blocker therapy is
standard.

Cardiac arrest Management
With HCM
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
An ICD is recommended:
• When there is spontaneous sustained
VT causing syncope or hemodynamic
compromise.
• For those who have survived a sudden
cardiac arrest due to VT or VF (note that this
indication is included for completeness but
falls under secondary rather than primary
prevention).
An ICD is reasonable for those with:
• ≥1 of the following risk factors for SCD:
• Maximum left ventricular (LV) wall
thickness ≥30 mm
• SCD in ≥1 first-degree relative
presumably caused by HCM
• ≥1 episode of unexplained syncope
within the preceding 6 months
• Spontaneous nonsustained VT or an
abnormal BP response with exercise
(decrease in BP of 20 mmHg or failure
to increase systolic BP >20 mmHg); with
additional SCD risk modifiers or high-risk
features.
Potential risk modifiers include:
• Age <30 years
• Delayed hyperenhancement on cardiac MRI
• Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)
obstruction
• Syncope <5 years ago
High-risk features include:
• LV aneurysm
• LVEF <50%
An ICD may be considered (but is of uncertain
benefit) for those with:
• Spontaneous nonsustained VT or an
abnormal BP response with exercise; with no
other SCD risk modifiers.

Cardiac arrest Management
MANAGEMENT
All
Intervention Goal
Avoidance of drugs that may prolong the QTc
interval; maintenance of normal potassium
and magnesium balance; use antipyretics to
treat any fever; consider genetic counseling
and testing
Avoid using medications that may prolong the QT
interval in all people with long QT syndrome unless
there are no suitable alternatives; careful monitoring
of the QTc during therapy is recommended, with
consideration for discontinuing therapy with marked
QTc prolongation.
The risk of adverse events increases in patients
with long QT syndrome with prolongation of the QTc
interval >500 ms.
Consult your local drug information source for
more information on drugs associated with QT
prolongation.
Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia if they
occur (e.g., during gastrointestinal illness) as these
increase the risk of VA and torsades de pointes.
Recommend that patients use antipyretics for fever;
rare case reports exist of fever prolonging the QTc
interval in patients with long QT syndrome type 2.
Reduced risk of QT prolongation and adverse
cardiac events, including torsades de pointes
With resting QTc >470 ms
Intervention Goal
Long-term beta-blocker is recommended
Randomized controlled trials to assess comparative
efficacy of specific beta-blockers are unavailable,
although many centers favor the use of nadolol;
consult your local drug information source for further
information.
Reduced risk of SCA
Long-term use is recommended. It is recommended
that patients receiving a beta-blocker undergo
ongoing monitoring to assess new changes in QTc
over time, as well as adequacy of beta-blockade
with exertion.

Cardiac arrest Management
With resting QTc <470 ms
Intervention Goal
Long-term beta-blocker is reasonable
Patients with long QT syndrome and normal QTc
have a lower risk of VAs and SCD compared to
those with prolonged QTc, but they still have an
increased risk of SCA or SCD compared with
genotype-negative, age- and sex-matched general
patients.
Beta-blockers reduce the risk of adverse cardiac
events substantially and may be of particular benefit
during the first 3 decades of life when patients with
long QT syndrome are at the highest risk of all-
cause mortality.
Reduced risk of SCA
Changes in QTc occur over time, particularly during
puberty and during and after pregnancy, indicating
the need for assessment of QTc on ECG annually or
with medication changes, and assessing medication
efficacy with exercise testing as feasible.
It is recommended that patients receiving a beta-
blocker undergo ongoing monitoring to assess new
changes in QTc over time, as well as adequacy of
beta-blockade with exertion.

Cardiac arrest Management
MANAGEMENT
With high-risk subtype of long QT syndrome; beta-blocker ineffective or not tolerated
Intervention Goal
Treatment intensification
High-risk patients with long QT syndrome include
those with:
• QTc >500 ms
• Recurrent syncope
• Mutations associated with a high risk of
adverse cardiac events
• Age <40 years
• Onset of symptoms age <10 years
• Prior cardiac arrest (note this would be an
indication for secondary rather than primary
prevention)
Women with long QT syndrome type 2 are at
high risk of postpartum cardiac arrest/SCD;
prepregnancy counseling is recommended for
this group. They may be candidates for primary
prevention ICD placement or use of a wearable
cardioverter-defibrillator.
Intensification of therapy may include:
• additional medications, or
• left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or
• an ICD.
Use of additional medications is guided by long QT
syndrome type.
For asymptomatic males with long QT syndrome,
the risk of cardiac events is highest in childhood,
during a time when medication compliance can be
challenging.

All
Intervention Goal
Long-term maximum tolerated beta-blocker
therapy; consider genetic counseling and
testing
Use of a maximally tolerated dose of a beta-blocker
is strongly recommended to reduce the risk of
adverse cardiac events.
Some experts prefer the use of nadolol over other
types of beta-blockers; direct comparison data
among beta-blockers are lacking.
See Sustained ventricular tachycardia .
Reduced risk of SCA/SCD
With recurrent sustained VT or syncope; receiving adequate or maximally tolerated beta-blocker
Intervention Goal
Treatment intensification
Treatment intensification may include either:
• combination medical therapy (e.g., with a
beta-blocker plus flecainide),
• left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and/or
• an ICD.
It is recommended that use of an ICD is reserved
for people with prior SCA (i.e., as secondary
prevention) or for those with refractory VAs already
receiving combination medical therapy.
Reduced risk of SCA/SCD; reduced risk of
appropriate ICD shocks
For patients with an ICD, programming should be
optimized to deliver therapy for VF and to minimize
inappropriate shocks and the risk of potentially fatal
electric storms.

When patients present with an early repolarization
pattern on an ECG, it is important to rule out
reversible causes such as ischemia.
The early repolarization pattern is lost during 10-
year follow-up in >60% of young males.
Observe for the development of early repolarization
syndrome; patients are determined to have an early

An ICD is recommended in this scenario (note that
ICD insertion following cardiac arrest falls under
secondary rather than primary prevention but is
included for completeness).
Patients with cardiac arrest or VF in the setting of an
electrocardiographic pattern of early repolarization
are at increased risk for subsequent recurrent

For those who are asymptomatic with an incidental
finding of a short QTc ≤320 ms, offer monitoring and
follow-up without use of prophylactic medication.
Detection and appropriate management of
symptomatic short QT syndrome
With increased risk for SCD
Intervention Goal
Consider ICD
The risk of SCD is increased in patients with:
• QTc duration ≤300 ms
• History of documented polymorphic VT or VF
• Unexplained syncope
• Family history of autopsy-negative SCD or
sudden infant death syndrome
• Positive genotype results

A beta-blocker or nondihydropyradine calcium-
channel blocker is recommended first line.
Antiarrhythmics are reasonable if these are
ineffective or not tolerated.
If antiarrhythmics are ineffective, not tolerated, or
not the patient’s preference, frequent premature
ventricular contractions (PVCs) can be effectively
treated with catheter ablation.
Reduced risk of recurrent symptomatic
arrhythmias
With idiopathic polymorphic VT/VF
Intervention Goal

Only consider offering an ICD to patients who are
expected to survive for more than one year of good
quality life.
Reduced risk of VT/SCD
With repaired TOF physiology and indicible VT/VF or spontaneous sustained VT
Intervention Goal
ICD is reasonable
Because of the high incidence of inappropriate
shocks (in approximately 20% to 30% of patients)
and complications in at least 30% of patients with
adult congenital heart disease in addition to financial
and psychological burdens, shared decision-making
regarding primary prevention ICDs is essential.
Only consider offering an ICD to patients who are

Reduced risk of VT/SCD
With recurrent sustained monomorphic VT or recurrent ICD shocks for VT
Intervention Goal
Catheter ablation can be effective
For patients with complex adult congenital heart
disease, it is strongly recommended that care is
provided at experienced centers.
Simultaneous hemodynamic repair should be
considered.
After successful catheter ablation of VT,
implantation of an ICD for those who do not have an
ICD is an individualized decision based on overall
functional and physiological status and shared
decision making.

Cardiac arrest Management
MANAGEMENT
With repaired severe complexity adult congenital heart disease and frequent or complex VAs
Intervention Goal
A beta-blocker can be beneficial
The highest risk of SCD associated with repaired
congenital heart disease reported from large
contemporaneous cohorts is in patients with:
• Transposition of the great arteries with atrial
baffle repair
• Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve
• Aortic stenosis
• Univentricular physiology
Patients with Senning or Mustard atrial baffle repairs
are at an increased risk for SCA, particularly during
exertion.
Reduced risk of SCD and SCA
With repaired moderate or severe complexity adult congenital heart disease with unexplained
syncope; with at least moderate ventricular dysfunction or marked hypertrophy
Intervention Goal
ICD is reasonable
The risk of SCD is highest among patients with
moderate or severe complexity congenital heart
disease.
An ICD may be considered either from the offset
in such patients, or after electrophysiological study
showing inducible sustained VA.
The development of unexplained syncope in
patients with moderate or severe complexity adult
congenital heart disease may be a precursor to
SCD; electrophysiological study with consideration
for an ICD as primary prevention can be beneficial.
Only consider offering an ICD to patients who are
expected to survive for more than one year of good

Secondary prevention
Survivors of cardiac arrest should be assessed for suitability for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
placement.[7] A meta-analysis of three key early ICD trials comparing ICD to medical therapy (primarily
amiodarone) for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death demonstrated a 28% mortality reduction in
the ICD group, almost entirely due to a 50% reduction of arrhythmic death.[137] Therefore, the use of an ICD
for secondary prevention in patients with either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy who have survived
a cardiac arrest that is not due to reversible causes is widely accepted.[7] [45][138] The key determinant for
intervention common to all those potentially eligible for a device is a meaningful life expectancy greater than
1 year.[45] Complications of ICD therapy include inappropriate shocks, lead fractures, and device-related
infections.[7]
Patients with ICDs who have frequent arrhythmia recurrences and ICD shocks (despite optimal
programming) may benefit from antiarrhythmic medications or catheter ablation. Antiarrhythmic drugs may
also have a role in patients who do not want or are ineligible for an ICD (e.g., due to a limited life expectancy
and/or functional status).[45]
Beyond ICDs, secondary prevention is generally condition specific, for example, performing revascularization
for patients with coronary artery disease, administering beta-blockers, avoiding QT-prolonging medications
in patients with long-QT syndrome, and abstaining from participation in competitive athletics in patients with
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.[126]
In all patients diagnosed with heart disease, cardiovascular risk factors should be addressed. Smoking
cessation should be emphasized and aggressive interventions including support groups and pharmacologic
(nicotine and non-nicotine-containing) products are recommended. Similarly, diet and lipid-lowering therapy
should be pursued. Blood pressure and diabetes management should be optimized. One study found that
initiation or maintenance of at least 5 days of moderate intensity activity or 3 days of vigorous-intensity
activity a week is associated with reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular deaths in
older adults with newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease.[139]
Efforts to maximize the probability of survival should a further arrest occur include educating family and
caregivers about what a cardiac arrest may look like and when to call for help. Some hospitals offer
cardiopulmonary resuscitation training to patients and their families before discharge.[126]

Monitoring
Monitoring
The ongoing care of patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation after sudden cardiac
arrest is directed at uncovering and addressing the underlying etiology for the arrest, and minimizing
the risk of recurrence. In a broad sense, routine care involves the modification of risk factors for
atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, etc.), as well as imaging,
electrophysiologic studies, or genetic testing, to determine appropriate candidates for invasive therapy.
Specific recommendations for follow-up testing and treatment are particular to each underlying disease
process.
Cardiac arrest survivors should be followed up within 3 months of hospital discharge.[95] This
assessment should include cognitive screening, screening for emotional problems and fatigue, and the
provision of information and support for patients and their family. To screen for cognition, the patient
can be asked about common cognitive complaints, such as memory problems, attention difficulties,
distractibility, slowness in thinking, irritability, and problems in initiation, planning, multitasking, or flexibility.
Family members can also provide useful collateral history about changes in cognition and behavior;
a structured questionnaire, such as the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive decline in the Elderly
Cardiac Arrest version (IQCODE-CA) or the Checklist Cognition and Emotion (CLCE-24), may be used.
Formal cognitive screening is recommended because patients are not always aware of their cognitive
impairments; European guidelines recommend the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) tool, which
takes approximately 10 min to administer, is easy to use and available in many languages.  [MoCA
Cognition: montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) tool] (https://mocacognition.com)  If there are signs of
cognitive impairment, referral to a neuropsychologist for more extensive neuropsychologic assessment, or
another specialist in cognitive rehabilitation, such as an occupational therapist, should be considered.[95]
To screen for emotional problems, patients should be asked about the presence of psychological
symptoms, including symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. Questionnaires
such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) may be useful. If severe emotional
problems are detected, referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment is
recommended.[95]
Patients should be asked if they are experiencing fatigue. In case of severe fatigue, referral to a specialist
in rehabilitation medication should be considered.[95]
Patients and their family should be provided with information about cardiac disease, risk factors,
medication and ICDs, as well as potential physical, cognitive and emotional changes and fatigue,
resuming daily activities, driving, work, and relationships and sex. It is also important to monitor the well-
being of family members; partners, especially women and those who witnessed the resuscitation, often
experience emotional problems, including symptoms of anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Referral to a
social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist may be helpful.[95]

Cardiac arrest Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
death short term high
Data from 2022 shows that survival to hospital discharge is 9.3% for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest, and 21.2% for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest.[2]
Considerations include termination of resuscitative efforts and consultation with family members. The
American Heart Association recommends that organ donation is considered in all resuscitated patients
who meet the neurologic criteria for death or before planned withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies.[55]
rib and sternal fractures short term high
Traumatic injury due to CPR manifests as rib and/or sternal fractures. It occurs in approximately one third
of patients, but the rate of serious complications as a result is quite low.[127] Care should be taken to
evaluate for further sequelae, such as penetrating trauma to internal organs.
Therapy is directed at analgesia and maintaining adequate secretion clearance.
anoxic brain injury short term high
Impaired circulation deprives the brain of nutrients and oxygen. The degree of injury spans the spectrum
from brain death to persistent vegetative state to coma to recovery.
Prognosis is affected by the duration of arrest and CPR.[128] It is estimated that almost 50% of survivors
of sudden cardiac arrest face some degree of diminished neurologic dysfunction.[129] This may be due
to increased cerebral oxygen consumption, the generation and accumulation of oxygen free radicals,
activation of the inflammatory cascade, or a rise in intracranial pressure seen after cardiac arrest.[130]
Maintaining hemodynamic stability is of paramount importance. Targeted temperature management
decreases mortality and improves neurologic outcome.[91]
ischemic liver injury ("shock liver") short term medium
Due to the loss of splanchnic circulation during cardiac arrest, the liver faces hypoxic-ischemic injury,
propagated by the inflammatory response of hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and the endothelium.[131]
Furthermore, restoration of oxygen to the liver through resuscitation results in reperfusion injury via the
generation of reactive oxygen species.[132] The degree of damage is proportional to the duration of
impaired circulation.
The management of shock liver is supportive. Maintaining hemodynamic stability and avoiding further
damage to the liver are the mainstays of treatment.
renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN) short term medium
Loss of circulation initiates the process of ischemic renal injury.[133] This causes endothelial damage,
which further propagates injury through mechanisms of impaired vascular regulation, infiltration of
inflammatory mediators, and a procoagulant state; this is called the "extension" phase of ischemic
ATN.[134]
Management of ischemic ATN is supportive. Maintaining hemodynamic stability, optimizing volume status,
avoiding nephrotoxins, and potential hemodialysis are the mainstays of therapy.

Cardiac arrest Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
recurrent cardiac arrest variable high
The median time to recurrence is 20 weeks after the sentinel event.[135] In a study of 234 patients having
out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), almost 40% of patients developed
recurrent VF or death.[135] The risk of death in survivors varies depending on whether sudden cardiac
arrest was due to a major cardiovascular event.[136]
Treating underlying coronary artery disease, electrolyte disturbances, or other causes is instrumental
in decreasing the risk of repeat cardiac arrest. Judicious use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in
select patients is of paramount importance.[7]
Prognosis
The outcome of sudden cardiac arrest is generally poor; while the application of algorithms for the treatment
of sudden cardiac arrest has evolved, and the rate of sudden cardiac arrest is decreasing, the rate of
successful recovery of a perfusing rhythm is still low. According to the US Cardiac Arrest Registry to
Enhance Survival (CARES), survival to hospital admission after emergency medical services-treated
nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in 2022 was 24.9% for all presentations, with higher
survival rates in public places (36.9%) and lower survival rates in homes/residences (23.5%) and nursing
homes (14.4%). Only 9.3% of patients with OHCA survive until hospital discharge.[2] The mean global
survival rate of patients with OHCA is 7.7% at 1 year after hospital discharge, with variations worldwide.[118]
Early provision of CPR, including compression-only CPR, by bystanders during OHCA increases the rate
of survival.[78] [79] Other factors associated with a better prognosis include witnessed arrest, arrest during
daytime hours, and initial shockable rhythm.[119] 
Factors associated with a worse prognosis include male sex, ages >60 years, active malignancy, and chronic
kidney disease.[119] Patients with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation at diagnosis have the
greatest rate of survival, followed by those who are found in pulseless electrical activity, and lastly patients
found in asystole.
The most common mechanism of death after successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest is withdrawal of
life-sustaining treatment on the basis of perceived poor neurologic prognosis due to underlying hypoxic-
ischemic brain injury. Among cardiac arrest survivors, about half remain comatose 72 hours following return
of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).[120] Neuroprognostication is an important component of the care
pathway for these patients, but is complex, challenging, and often guided by limited evidence. Guidelines
advise that definitive neuroprognostication should generally not occur before 72 hours after ROSC and
should be performed in the absence of sedation or other confounders that may delay awakening (e.g.,
seizures, hypothermia, sepsis, renal failure, delirium, and hepatic encephalopathy).[116] [120] It should
be multimodal, with consideration of the complete clinical picture (taking into account factors that impact
overall prognosis, such as older age, poor baseline level of functioning, or preexisting illness associated
with limited life expectancy), and never based on a single variable. Modalities include neurologic exam,
electroencephalogram (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), brain laboratory (computed
tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), and/or biomarkers (e.g., neuron specific enolase [NSE])
where available.[116] [120] The following findings on neurologic exam portend death or a poor neurologic
outcome: at 24 hours - loss of corneal reflex, lack of motor response, lack of withdrawal to pain, and loss of
pupillary response; and at 72 hours - lack of motor response.[121] When functional recovery does occur, the
time course is highly variable.[120]
Among patients admitted to hospital after OHCA, the survival rate to discharge is approximately 50% to
60%.[122] Those who do survive to hospital discharge often have neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, hepatic,
renal, or musculoskeletal complications. A survey of survivors of OHCA in Denmark, however, found that
long-term patient-reported health-related quality of life up to 20 years after their event was consistently high

Cardiac arrest Follow up
and comparable to that of the general population.[123] Most survivors are able to return home, with only a
small percentage (1% to 10%) requiring admission to a long-term care facility.[95] Data on long-term survival
beyond 12 months after OHCA are scarce, but one systematic review found that survival after 10 years in
patients surviving the initial hospital stay was between 62% and 64%. Patients with a shockable initial rhythm
had a lower risk of long-term mortality compared with those with a nonshockable rhythm (hazard ratio 0.30;
95% CI 0.23-0.39).[122]
In European countries where withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) is routinely practiced, a good
neurologic outcome is seen in >90% of patients. In situations where WLST is not applied, however, severe
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is substantially more common; an Italian study reported that more than 50%
(n = 119)  of survivors had a poor outcome 6 months post-event, with one third (n = 68)  in a persistent
vegetative state.[124] [125] Among survivors with a good neurologic outcome, many experience long-
term cognitive, emotional, and physical problems, as well as fatigue.[125] Approximately 40% to 50% have
cognitive impairments due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. These are mainly mild to moderate and tend to
affect memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Most cognitive recovery occurs in the
first 3 months after cardiac arrest.[95] [125] Emotional problems are also common; anxiety is present in 15%
to 30% of survivors at 3-6 months (and remains in 15% to 23% at 12 months), while depression affects 13%
to 32% of patients at 3-6 months (decreasing to 5% to 15% at 12 months).[95] Symptoms of stress and post-
traumatic stress are reported in 16% to 28% of survivors, and some patients develop behavioral problems,
such as emotional lability or aggression.[95] [125] Fatigue is reported in approximately 70% of survivors at
6 months, and 50% at one year. Physical problems include rib fractures, muscle weakness, and restricted
mobility, and some patients may benefit from referral to a physical therapist or occupational therapist.[95]
[126] Of those who were previously working, 63% to 85% are able to return to work, although some need to
adapt their working hours or activities.[95]

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
