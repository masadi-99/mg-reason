Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Overview
Summary
Cyanosis and tachypnea are frequently encountered in the neonatal period. The prevalence of respiratory
distress in newborns ranges from 2.9% to 7.6%. Cyanosis can result from a range of disorders, including
cardiac, metabolic, neurologic, and pulmonary disorders. In all, 4.3% of newborns may require supplemental
oxygen therapy because of cyanosis.[1] [2] [3] Cyanosis is dependent on the absolute concentration of the
reduced hemoglobin and not on the ratio of reduced hemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin. It is visually perceptible
when reduced hemoglobin exceeds 3-5 g/dL. Cyanosis is classified into central and peripheral cyanosis.
When present throughout the body, including the mucous membranes and tongue, the condition is termed
central cyanosis. When limited to the extremities, it is termed peripheral cyanosis or acrocyanosis.

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Theory
THEORY
Etiology
Any of the following five mechanisms may give rise to arterial oxygen desaturation:
• Hypoventilation
• Ventilation-perfusion mismatching
• Diffusion impairment
• Significant right-to-left intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting
• Inadequate transport of oxygen by the hemoglobin.
During assessment, it is helpful to break down the etiology into different systems. Cyanosis may be due to:
Cardiac causes (memorized as the 5-Ts mnemonic):
• Transposition of great arteries: the great arteries (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) have their
origins transposed, so that the aorta originates from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery
originates from the left ventricle. Thus, deoxygenated blood is in the aorta, giving rise to severe
cyanosis. Generally, these infants have an intracardiac shunt, such as a ventricular septal defect
(VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD). The condition is a life-threatening emergency if there is no
intracardiac shunt.
• Tetralogy of Fallot: the four common components are right ventricular hypertrophy, infundibular
pulmonary stenosis, overriding of the aorta, and a VSD. Most infants will be cyanotic at birth but a few
of them will have adequate oxygen saturation, depending on the pulmonary blood flow and shunt.
• Total anomalous pulmonary venous return: the pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium (instead
of the left atrium) and this condition leads to profound cyanosis and pulmonary congestion. The
veins may also drain into the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, or hepatic veins. The condition
is generally associated with an ASD for intracardiac shunting. The condition can be partial or total,
depending on whether all four pulmonary veins drain into the right side or not.
• Truncus arteriosus: one large vessel originates from both ventricles, instead of two vessels (the aorta
and the pulmonary artery). It is associated with a VSD. This gives rise to cyanosis and increased
pulmonary blood flow.
• Tricuspid atresia: right atrial blood is forced to shunt through foramen ovale or ASD to the left atrium;
most patients also have a VSD. This condition is usually associated with a hypoplastic right ventricle.
Other less common cardiac causes:
• Pulmonary atresia: generally associated with a VSD but may occur with intact ventricular septum, in
which case pulmonary blood flow depends on the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).
• Ebstein anomaly: the tricuspid valve is abnormal with two of its leaflets displaced toward the right
ventricle with subsequent atrialization of the right ventricle. The right atrium is significantly enlarged
and there is regurgitation of the tricuspid valve; shunt takes place from right atrium through foramen
ovale to left atrium.
• Left-to-right shunt with pulmonary edema: generally this takes place if there is a VSD or PDA.
Cyanosis is less severe than in conditions where there is right-to-left shunt but they have more severe
respiratory distress.
• Single ventricle states (hypoplastic left or right heart).
• Low cardiac output states.

vascular resistance and delayed clearance of fetal pulmonary fluid; acrocyanosis is frequently seen
• Asphyxia resulting in subsequent hypoventilation
• Arteriovenous malformation leading to (high output) congestive heart failure.
Other disorders of hemoglobin (hemoglobin M and sulfhemoglobinemia) occur very rarely. Cyanosis can also
result in any severely ill infant when a range of other features are present (e.g., metabolic acidosis, seizures).

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Emergencies
Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
In most healthy infants, the oxygen saturation rises to >90% by 10 minutes of age.[5] All cases of newborn
cyanosis persisting beyond the first 10 minutes postpartum require immediate attention. Most cases of
persistent newborn cyanosis are due to cardiopulmonary causes that require rapid intervention with a goal of
maintaining oxygen saturation >90%.
• Oxygen administration should occur prior to evaluation of the underlying cause.
• Oxygen saturation should be maintained >90%, except in the presence of cyanotic cardiac lesions
(which increase risk for pulmonary overcirculation, and where a target range of 75% to 85% is typically
recommended).[6] [7] [8]
• Assisted ventilation should be considered for all infants with severe cyanosis.[9] Effective positive-
pressure ventilation should be prioritized in newborns requiring support.[10] For preterm newborn
infants, use nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) if possible, rather than invasive
ventilation.[9] There is insufficient evidence to suggest for or against the use of exhaled carbon dioxide
to guide noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (with face masks, supraglottic airways, or
nasal cannulas) in infants immediately after birth.[11]
Preterm neonates may require surfactant administration through a tracheal tube to increase lung
compliance.[9] Surfactant administration is essential to treat respiratory distress syndrome.[12]
Vascular access should be established for infusion of drugs and/or fluids:
• Fluids and vasopressors (dopamine, dobutamine, or epinephrine) should be given for hypotension and
shock.
• Antibiotics should be given if there is evidence of sepsis (see below) or pneumonia.
• Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) infusion should be given to maintain patency of ductus arteriosus in
suspected ductal-dependent congenital cardiac conditions.
Administration of alprostadil as an intravenous infusion is life-saving in infants with ductal-dependent cyanotic
cardiac lesions. Treatment should therefore be initiated without delay if this cause is suspected, keeping in
mind that apnea can result from alprostadil administration.
Symptomatic hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected with intravenous administration of
glucose or calcium, as these conditions can give rise to apnea (with or without seizures).
Cyanotic infants with suspected congenital heart disease should be transferred to a tertiary care center
immediately for further management and treatment with balloon septostomy and/or surgery as necessary.
Infants with severe pulmonary hypertension should be referred to a center equipped with nitric oxide.
Sepsis
Cyanosis may be a presenting symptom of sepsis. Sepsis is a spectrum of disease, where there is a
systemic and dysregulated host response to an infection.[13] Presentation ranges from subtle, nonspecific
symptoms (e.g., feeling unwell with a normal temperature) to severe symptoms with evidence of multiorgan
dysfunction and septic shock. Patients may have signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, fever or
hypothermia, poor capillary refill, mottled or ashen skin, cyanosis, newly altered mental state or reduced
urine output.[14] Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies.

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Emergencies
EMERGENCIES
Risk factors for sepsis include: age under 1 year, impaired immunity, recent surgery or other invasive
procedures, any breach of skin integrity, and indwelling lines or catheters.[14]
Early recognition of sepsis is essential because early treatment improves outcomes.[14] [15] [Evidence
C] However, detection can be challenging because the clinical presentation of sepsis can be subtle and
nonspecific. A low threshold for suspecting sepsis is therefore important. The key to early recognition is the
systematic identification of any patient who has signs or symptoms suggestive of infection and is at risk of
deterioration due to organ dysfunction. Criteria to identify sepsis and septic shock in children and young
people under the age of 18 years have been developed.[16] Several other risk stratification approaches exist.
All rely on a structured clinical assessment and recording of the patient's vital signs.[14] [16][17] [18][19] It
is important to check local guidance for information on which approach your institution recommends. The
timeline of ensuing investigations and treatment should be guided by this early assessment.[19]
Treatment guidelines have been produced by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and remain the most widely
accepted standards.[15] Within the first hour:[15]
• Follow institutional protocols for management of sepsis/septic shock in neonates; these improve the
speed and reliability of care
• Obtain blood cultures before administering antibiotics (provided this does not substantially delay
antibiotic administration)
• Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics
• Administer crystalloid fluids, titrated to clinical signs of cardiac output and stopped if there is evidence
of volume overload. Consult local protocols.
Use trends in blood lactate levels to guide resuscitation. If the child's hypotension is refractory to fluid
resuscitation, consider use of vasopressors.[15]

• Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM; formerly known as congenital cystic adenomatoid
malformation [CCAM])
• Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
Onset hours after birth:
• Cyanotic congenital heart disease
• Aspiration
• Tracheoesophageal fistula
• Pneumonia.
General examination
In a cold environment, acrocyanosis is common. Exam should be performed under a radiant warmer in a
well-lit room.[12] Prolonged capillary refill time is often evident when peripheral perfusion is suboptimal in:
• Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
• Sepsis/pneumonia
• Polycythemia
• Acidosis
• Hypovolemic states
• Hypothermia.
Respiratory examination
Tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, and grunting generally indicate a pulmonary cause. However,
these symptoms may also occur in cardiac conditions with significant left-to-right shunt or in sepsis/
shock syndromes. The respiratory rate may be normal in infants with cyanotic heart disease or
methemoglobinemia. Apnea and cyanosis may be due to sepsis, asphyxia, or seizures.
Upper airway obstruction may be evident from stridulous breathing due to:
• Laryngotracheomalacia
• Subglottic stenosis
• Vocal cord paralysis
• Glossoptosis with micrognathia (Pierre-Robin syndrome).
Upper airway obstruction can also give rise to supraclavicular, submandibular, and suprasternal retractions.
Bilateral choanal atresia generally gives rise to significant retractions at birth, but the symptoms are relieved
by an oral airway. Cyanosis due to parenchymal lung disease is associated with intercostal and subcostal
retractions.
Absent/poor aeration of one side of chest on auscultation may be due to:
• Pneumothorax
• Pleural effusion
• Atelectasis
• Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Cardiovascular examination
Normal heart rate in full-term newborns is approximately 120 beats per minute (bpm), with a range of 100
to 140 bpm. During quiet states it may be as low as 90 bpm. Heart rates >160 bpm during quiet state are
abnormal. In supraventricular tachycardia, heart rates >200 bpm are usually seen. Heart rate variability is
also important: in severe sepsis and asphyxia, the beat-to-beat variability will be lost. S2 is loud and narrowly
split in pulmonary hypertension.
A single S2 is generally indicative of:
• Severe pulmonary stenosis
• Pulmonary atresia
• Abnormal single valve position (transposition of great arteries)
• A large semilunar valve, as in truncus arteriosus.
It is important to record the type and quality of murmurs. The location of apical impulse should be noted to
rule out dextrocardia. Precordial thrill indicates significant murmur of grade >3/6. Precordial hyperactivity
is generally due to increased ventricular activity. It should be remembered that not all heart murmurs are
pathologic and that many serious congenital cardiac conditions do not cause murmurs.
Abdominal examination
The abdomen may appear scaphoid in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Abdominal distention due to
bowel obstruction or ascites can give rise to respiratory distress. Hepatosplenomegaly with ascites and
hydrops fetalis may occur in cases of severe hemolytic disease of the newborn, a potential cause of severe
respiratory distress. Hepatomegaly can coexist with pulmonary congestion in conditions such as total
anomalous pulmonary venous return. Absence of bowel sounds indicates ileus and is associated with sepsis,
gangrenous bowel, or peritonitis.
Central nervous system examination
Hypotonia is one of the earliest signs of:
• Sepsis
• Asphyxia
• Metabolic disorders.
Phrenic nerve paresis/paralysis can precipitate respiratory distress and is associated with Erb palsy following
traumatic vaginal delivery. Excessive traction on the neck or vaginal breech extraction are the common
etiologies.
Chest x-ray
Chest x-ray is integral to initial assessment of respiratory distress.[4] [20] [21] The location of stomach, liver,
and heart should be ascertained to rule out dextrocardia and situs inversus.
The size and shape of the heart may yield some clues to the diagnosis:
• A small heart may be due to hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency from asphyxia or adrenal hemorrhage,
significant pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and congenital lobar emphysema.
• Severe cardiomegaly is present in Ebstein anomaly. Moderate cardiomegaly is seen in infants with
diabetic mothers (hyperinsulinemia) and in cardiomyopathy (infections, metabolic disorders, or

asphyxia) and congestive cardiac failure. Congestive heart failure without intrinsic cardiac anomaly is
seen in coarctation of the aorta and arteriovenous malformation.
• The commonly described cardiac silhouettes in congenital heart disease are:
• "Egg on end" appearance of transposition of the great vessels
• "Snowman" sign (a rounded, figure-of-eight-like cardiac contour) of unobstructed total
anomalous pulmonary venous return, surrounded by "snowy" lung fields due to pulmonary
congestion
• Boot-shaped heart of tetralogy of Fallot.
Pulmonary vascular markings may yield further clues toward the diagnosis:
• Increased pulmonary vascular markings and pulmonary congestion are indicative of left-to-right shunt
• Decreased pulmonary vascular markings (oligemic lung fields) indicate pulmonary stenosis or
pulmonary atresia with inadequate ductal shunting. They may also occur in persistent pulmonary
hypertension of the newborn.
The expansion of lungs (lung volume) on both sides should be checked. Normal inspiratory films should
have 8 intercostal spaces of lung fields on both sides. Diaphragmatic paralysis (more commonly seen on
the right side) is manifested by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm by more than 2 intercostal spaces
compared with the left side. This may simulate right lower lobe atelectasis. Hyperinflated lung fields are seen
occasionally in lobar emphysema or cystic lesions of lungs. The prevalence of spontaneous air leaks giving
rise to pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in full-term newborns is approximately 1% to 2%.

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Diagnosis
It is important to check the bony thoracic cage. In asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, the thoracic cage will be
small and narrow. The thorax may have a bell-shaped appearance in infants with severe hypotonia. Fractures
of the ribs, humerus, or clavicles should be looked for following difficult vaginal deliveries, as infants may
develop respiratory distress from the pain and splinting of the chest.

Ultrasound examination of diaphragmatic motion during spontaneous breathing can detect paradoxical
motion in diaphragmatic paralysis. Pleural effusion, eventration of the diaphragm (an abnormal elevation of
an intact diaphragm), and size/location of the liver/spleen can also be determined.
Other imaging
Computed tomography scan of the chest is occasionally helpful if diagnosis is not clear, and it can identify
congenital abnormalities and tumors of the mediastinum, lungs, and heart. Feeding-associated cyanosis may
be due to incoordination of sucking and swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux, vocal cord paralysis, laryngeal
cleft, severe birth asphyxia, or tracheoesophageal fistula. A pediatric gastroenterologist may recommend a
pH probe test or upper gastrointestinal contrast study to rule out severe gastroesophageal reflux.
Pulse oximetry
Pulse oximetry monitoring is recommended for all infants with respiratory distress and cyanosis, because
clinician assessment of color at birth varies.[22] It is an accurate, reliable, and noninvasive method for
monitoring oxygen saturation in infants.[23] [24] [25] [26] In severe cyanosis with respiratory distress,
both preductal and postductal oxygen saturations should be monitored to detect the gradient across the
ductus arteriosus. For this procedure, the pulse oximeter probes should be placed over the right hand and a
lower extremity (never the left hand). Acrocyanosis is a common finding in young newborns. This generally
resolves spontaneously.
Pulse oximetry screening is now accepted practice for early detection of critical congenital heart disease
(CCHD) in the newborn, and may detect life-threatening malformations before symptoms develop.[27] [28]
A significant body of evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategy for reducing morbidity and
mortality rates in young children.[28] [29] CCHD screening has been widely implemented in the US and
Europe, and complements physical exams with relatively few false positive screens.[28] [30]
Laboratory tests
ABG can help in determining the oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base status of the infant. In
methemoglobinemia, the PaO₂ is normal even with cyanosis. Elevated serum lactate is indicative of
inadequate oxygen delivery.
CBC with differential count is an important test to rule out polycythemia, anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia,
abnormal I:T (immature to total neutrophil count) ratio, and thrombocytopenia as signs of sepsis.
If sepsis is suspected, a blood culture should be obtained immediately and antibiotic therapy started. A spinal
tap should be performed in stable infants, but without delaying the start of antibiotic therapy.
Significant metabolic acidosis may indicate cardiac failure, sepsis, asphyxia, or metabolic disorders. Closure
of the ductus arteriosus in an infant with a ductal-dependent cardiac lesion can lead to shock and severe
metabolic acidosis with cyanosis and respiratory distress.

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Accurate blood glucose measurement is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal hypoglycemia.
Local protocols and guidelines on optimal blood sampling and measurement should be followed.[31]
Calcium and magnesium levels should be obtained where other causes have been ruled out. Hypocalcemia
and hypomagnesemia are both associated with central nervous system irritability and seizures.
Metabolic screening of urine and drug screening of urine/meconium should be performed as clinically
indicated.
ECG
An ECG is an important test, but of limited value except in the diagnosis of arrhythmias.[32] [33] Normally,
there is right ventricular predominance in the newborn, and many cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease
will have similar findings. Left axis deviation with left ventricular dominance is seen in tricuspid atresia or
pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. Left axis deviation is frequently seen in arteriovenous
canal malformation due to anatomical defects in the atrioventricular conduction system.
Echocardiogram
Echocardiogram is the definitive test in the diagnosis of congenital cardiac lesions and pulmonary
hypertension. A technician who is trained in performing echocardiograms in newborns and a pediatric
cardiologist are required for this procedure.

Evaluation of cyanosis in the newborn Evidence tables
EVIDENCE TABLES
Evidence tables
What are the effects of early versus late initiation of empiric antimicrobial
treatment in children with or at risk of developing sepsis or severe sepsis?[14]
This table is a summary of the analysis reported in a guideline (underpinned by a systematic review)
that focuses on the above important clinical question.
View the full source guideline (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng51/evidence)
Evidence C *
Confidence in the evidence is very low or low where GRADE has been performed
and the intervention may be more effective/beneficial than the comparison for key
outcomes. However, this is uncertain and new evidence could change this in the
future.
Population: Children with or at risk of developing sepsis or severe sepsis
Intervention: Early initiation of empiric antimicrobial treatment
Comparison: Late initiation of empiric antimicrobial treatment

Recommendations as stated in the source guideline
For children aged 5–11 years who have suspected sepsis and one or more high-risk criteria, give a broad-
spectrum antimicrobial ᵇ  at the maximum recommended dose without delay (within 1 hour of identifying that
they meet any high-risk criteria in an acute hospital setting).
Note
The guideline group noted that the direct evidence in children came from one small (n=130), single-
centre retrospective study of children in PICU with severe sepsis and septic shock. Therefore, they also

ᵇ  See full guideline for more information.
* Evidence levels
The Evidence level is an internal rating applied by BMJ Best Practice. See the EBM Toolkit (https://
bestpractice.bmj.com/info/evidence-tables/) for details.
Confidence in evidence
A -  High or moderate to high
B -  Moderate or low to moderate
C -  Very low or low
† Effectiveness (BMJ rating)
Based on statistical significance, which demonstrates that the results are unlikely to be due to chance, but
which does not necessarily translate to a clinical significance.
‡ Grade certainty ratings
High The authors are very confident that the true
effect is similar to the estimated effect.
Moderate The authors are moderately confident that
the true effect is likely to be close to the
estimated effect.
Low The authors have limited confidence in the
effect estimate and the true effect may be
substantially different.
Very Low The authors have very little confidence in
the effect estimate and the true effect is
likely to be substantially different.

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
