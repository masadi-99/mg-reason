Brugada syndrome Overview
Summary
Brugada syndrome (BrS) (also known as sudden unexplained [or unexpected] nocturnal death syndrome and
as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation) should be suspected in any patient with a past history of any one or more
of unexplained cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia (e.g., documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
or ventricular fibrillation) of unknown cause, or cardiogenic syncope. Be aware that patients may also present
asymptomatically with incidental findings of Brugada pattern on ECG, or through family screening.
Diagnosis of BrS is considered probable or definite if spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern is recorded on
ECG from the 2nd to 4th intercostal spaces. Induced type 1 Brugada pattern (e.g., by fever, medications such
as sodium-channel blockers, or by psychotropic drugs, alcohol, or illicit drugs) or type 2 or 3 Brugada pattern
on the ECG is not diagnostic, and requires further investigation. However, diagnosis of BrS should be made
by a specialist, and requires synthesis of ECG findings and features of the history (which should include
relevant family history) and physical exam.
Treatment consists of conservative management and primary and secondary prevention of serious
arrhythmic events. This aims to prevent serious arrhythmic events, while avoiding potential complications
of any treatments. Nonconservative treatments include implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD),
pharmacologic therapy, and radiofrequency catheter ablation.
Definition
Brugada syndrome (BrS) (also known as sudden unexplained [or unexpected] nocturnal death syndrome and
as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation) is an inherited channelopathy characterized by a typical pattern of ST-
segment elevation in the precordial leads V1-V3, and is associated with increased risk of serious arrhythmic
events such as ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.[1] BrS is typically first diagnosed in young- to
middle-aged patients and is rare in children.[1] [2] [3]
The diagnosis and management of BrS in children is not covered in this topic.

Brugada syndrome Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The true prevalence of Brugada syndrome (BrS) is difficult to determine because the diagnosis requires
specific ECG findings (which are often intermittent), and many patients are asymptomatic.[1] [7] [8] [9]
However, prevalence of BrS with type 1 Brugada pattern on the ECG is thought to be around 1 in 2000.[1] [4]
[8][9] [10] Prevalence of a type 2 or type 3 Brugada pattern on the ECG (which is not diagnostic of BrS, but
requires further investigation) is around 1 in 500.[1]
BrS is most commonly diagnosed in young- to middle-aged men; it is around 8 to 10 times more prevalent in
men than in women.[1] [10] [11] The phenotypic expression of BrS appears to be age dependent because it
is rare in children, with a prevalence of around 1 in 20,000.[1] [2] [3] However, BrS is thought to be the cause
of around 4% to 12% of sudden cardiac deaths in children and young athletes, and around 20% of sudden
explained deaths in young people in general.[12] Note that children are not covered elsewhere in this topic.
BrS occurs more commonly in Asia than in Europe and the US.[1] [13] It is particularly common in Southeast
Asia, where nocturnal sudden death syndrome in young men was clinically reported by a variety of local
names (e.g., bangungut, lai-tai, pokkuri, bei gui ya) in countries such as Philippines, Thailand, Japan, and
China, prior to the formal classification of BrS.[14] It is the leading cause of death in men under age 40 years
in Southeast Asia.[4]
Etiology
Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a condition that is inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern of
transmission with variable expression.[1] [4] [15] [9] Mutations of many genes have been implicated in BrS,
but only SCN5A gene variants are considered definitely disease-causing.[1] [7] However, identifiable SCN5A
variants are only found in approximately 20% to 30% of patients with BrS.[1] [16][17] [18] Mutations of other
genes may account for around 2% to 5% of cases.[14] [16] [17][19]
Features of BrS may be apparent only when induced by certain factors.[1] [7] Inducible features of BrS
are particularly important to identify in asymptomatic patients (i.e., those who do not have a past history of
unexplained cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, or syncope), but may also be present in symptomatic
patients. These include:[1] [7]
• Febrile illness. This is known to induce type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG and precipitate arrhythmic
events.[1] [7] In endemic regions, the prevalence of BrS in patients presenting with febrile illness for
any reason has been reportedly as high as 4%, around 20-fold greater than a nonfebrile control group
in one Thai cross-sectional study of 401 patients.[20] [21] While in isolation fever is not specific for
BrS, in a patient with suspected BrS, it has implications for both diagnosis and management.[1] [7]
• Medications.[1] [7] [18] These include sodium-channel blockers (e.g., flecainide, procainamide),
psychotropic medications (e.g., tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, lithium), and local anesthetics.
These are known to induce type 1 Brugada ECG changes and may also precipitate arrhythmic
events.[1] [7] [18]
• Illicit drugs or alcohol.[1] [7] These are known to induce type 1 Brugada ECG changes and may also
precipitate arrhythmic events.[1] [7] [18]

Brugada syndrome Theory
Pathophysiology
The underlying pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome (BrS) remains unclear.[1] It is likely that there are
a number of contributing factors that lead to the typical Brugada pattern on ECG, rather than a single
mechanism, because of the range of clinical manifestations and phenocopies.[1]
Around 20% to 30% of people with BrS have identifiable inherited mutations of the SCN5A gene, which
causes dysfunctional cardiac voltage gated NaV1.5 sodium channels.[1] [7] [16] [17] [18] These defective
sodium channels shorten the duration of the cardiac action potential, leading to a reduction of the peak influx
of sodium ions and a slowing in the upstroke (phase 0) of the cardiac action potential.[1] Over 300 mutations
of the SCN5A gene have been discovered so far.[22] This range of genetic mutations may cause differences
in electrophysiologic abnormalities, which could explain the different clinical manifestations of BrS.[23] [24]
Experimental studies have shown that the function of NaV1.5 sodium channels is also affected by changes in
temperature, with additional shortening of the cardiac action potential at higher temperatures.[1]

Brugada syndrome Theory
THEORY
Other genes that have been implicated in BrS (although their significance is disputed; only SCN5A gene
variants are considered definitely disease-causing) include SCN10A (which encodes for the a-subunit of the
NaV1.8 sodium channel), those that encode for NaV1.5 b-subunits, those involved in NaV1.5 trafficking or
expression, and potassium and calcium channel genes.[1] [17] [19][25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31]
There is debate about whether BrS is due to a primary repolarization disorder, a primary depolarization
disorder, or both.[1] [32] [33] The argument for a primary repolarization disorder is supported by the fact
that patients with BrS have a conduction delay in the right ventricular outflow tract, which is associated
with late action potentials.[1] This conduction delay results in heterogeneity of depolarization around the
right ventricular outflow tract, which is thought to predispose the patient to arrhythmias.[1] The argument
for a primary depolarization disorder is supported by evidence that has shown a dispersion of transmural
(epicardial-endocardial gradient) action potentials in canine models of pharmacologically induced BrS.[1]
[33] [34] Heterogeneity of repolarization between the epicardium and endocardium is thought to cause
arrhythmias by phase 2 re-entry.[1] [34] In addition, both repolarization and depolarization abnormalities have
been demonstrated in people with BrS, although it is suggested that these repolarization changes occur
secondary to a primary depolarization disorder.[1]
Some studies have shown that people with BrS have functional changes in the epicardial aspect of the
right ventricle.[1] [35] [36] There have also been histologic changes identified in the anterior right ventricular
outflow tract that are associated with areas of low voltage and the presence of abnormal fractionated
electrograms on electrophysiologic studies.[1] These changes include increased collagen and fibrosis,
presence of inflammatory infiltrates, and a reduction in connexin-43 (a gap junction protein that provides
electrical coupling between myocytes).[1] [37][38] Ablation that is targeted to these areas can result in
correction of the typical Brugada pattern ECG changes and prevention of ventricular arrhythmias.[1] [22] [37]

Case history
Case history #1
A 33-year-old man presents with palpitations and a recent episode of fainting while at the gym. An ECG
with standard lead positions is unremarkable, aside from occasional premature ventricular complexes.
Repeat ECG with high precordial leads shows ST segment elevation that is coved-type and >2 mm in
amplitude, and inverted T-waves in the right precordial leads. The patient reports that his uncle passed
away unexpectedly in his early 40s when his car went off the road unexpectedly while driving during
the daytime. The patient has a past medical history of depression, for which he is taking a selective
serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, but no other medical problems. He is a non-smoker but occasionally drinks
5-10 alcoholic beverages in one sitting while watching sports.
Case history #2
A 19-year old student who is a college athlete is undergoing preparticipation evaluation and noted to have
a type I Brugada pattern pattern on ECG. The student is asymptomatic, but states that his uncle died
aged 38 in his sleep in Southeast Asia.

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
Approach
Brugada syndrome is usually diagnosed through a combination of clinical features, risk factors, and ECG
findings, although the diagnosis is considered probable or definite if spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern is
recorded on ECG from the 2nd to 4th intercostal spaces.[1] [4][7] [51] Refer all patients with type 1 Brugada
pattern (spontaneous or induced) to a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist for further investigation. Key
differentials, such as acute coronary syndrome, should be excluded. The proposed Shanghai score may also
be used to aid diagnosis.[1]

History
Take a detailed history of any patient with suspected BrS to identify clinical features of BrS, risk factors
for BrS and sudden cardiac death, and other potential differentials. This is particularly important for the
diagnosis of BrS in patients with type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG that is induced by triggers (e.g., fever,
medications such as sodium-channel blockers or psychotropic drugs, alcohol, or illicit drugs), and in
asymptomatic patients with type 2 or 3 Brugada pattern on ECG.[1] [7]
Clinical features
Consider a diagnosis of symptomatic BrS if a patient has a past history of any one or more of the
following:
• Unexplained cardiac arrest, or documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT), or
ventricular fibrillation (VF)[1] [5] [7]
• There are many causes of sudden cardiac arrest, PMVT and VF, but BrS should be
considered as a differential, particularly if there is Brugada pattern on ECG and one or more
risk factors for BrS (see below).
• Patients may also present with monomorphic VT, but this is rare and should prompt
investigation of other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies.[5] [52] [53]
• Cardiogenic syncope
• Up to one third of patients with BrS present with, or have a history of, syncope at the time of
diagnosis.[54]

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
• Take a careful history to differentiate cardiogenic from noncardiogenic causes of syncope.[1]
[7] The Shanghai score for the diagnosis of BrS assigns 2 points to patients with suspected
cardiogenic syncope, and 1 point to those with an unclear cause of syncope.[1] [49]
• Patients with BrS who have a history of cardiogenic syncope are also at 2.5 to 5-fold greater
risk of serious arrhythmic events compared with those with noncardiogenic syncope.[47]
[48] [55] [56] [57] Patients with noncardiogenic syncope have not been shown to have an
increased risk for serious arrhythmic events.[58]
Other clinical features of BrS may include:
• Atrial fibrillation or flutter in a patient <30 years.[1] [59] [60]
• Concomitant atrial arrhythmias are common in patients with BrS, with a prevalence of
approximately 10%, although these are not specific for diagnosis of BrS.[61]
• Use of sodium-channel blockers may unmask the Brugada pattern in some of these
patients.[61]
• Nocturnal agonal respirations.[1] [7]
• The Shanghai score for BrS assigns 2 points to patients with nocturnal agonal
respirations.[1] [49]
• In a Danish national survey, prevalence of nocturnal agonal respirations in patients with BrS
was 14%, but this is likely to be greater in endemic areas.[62]
• Nocturnal agonal respirations were described in early reports from Southeast Asia
(Philippines, Thailand, Japan, China, and others) of sudden unexpected nocturnal death
syndrome (SUNDS), a syndrome which is thought to be genetically, phenotypically, and
functionally the same as BrS.[63]
Risk factors
Identify any of the following risk factors which are associated with, or increase the risk of, BrS and
subsequent sudden cardiac death:[1]
• Age 30 to 50 years[1]
• BrS is typically first diagnosed in young to middle-aged patients.[1]
• Patients ages 30 to 50 years with BrS are also at high risk of serious arrhythmic events.[39]
 This is also typically the age at which patients with BrS may present with their first serious
arrhythmic event.[1] However, serious arrhythmic events have also been reported in children
as young as <1 year old.[21] [40] [41] Women in particular may be more likely to have their
first SAE in childhood, or later in life.[1] [39]
• Patients >50 years who have BrS experience significantly fewer serious arrhythmic events
compared with younger patients, and for those ≥55 years at the time of BrS diagnosis,
annual mortality is similar to that of the general population.[41] [42] [43] However, it remains
unclear whether these observations are due to protective effects acquired through aging or
simply represent selection bias.
• Male sex[1]

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• BrS is more common in men compared with women.[1] [39] Men account for up to 90% of
cases of BrS in some cohorts.[1] [39]
• Evidence has shown that men with BrS are also at increased risk of serious arrhythmic
events.[44] [45] [46] However, this finding remains controversial, and has not been confirmed
with complete adjustment for potential confounding factors.[47] [48]
• Asian ancestry[1]
• BrS occurs more commonly in Asia compared with Europe and the US.[1] [13] BrS is
particularly common in Southeast Asia, where a nocturnal sudden death syndrome in young
men was clinically reported by a variety of local names in countries such as Philippines,
Thailand, Japan, and China, prior to the formal classification of BrS.[14]
• Positive family history
• Determine the following features (which form part of the Shanghai score) in any first or
second degree relative of the patient:[1] [49]
• Definite BrS
• Suspicious sudden cardiac death (febrile, nocturnal, confounded by BrS-associated
drug)
• Unexplained sudden cardiac death <45 years with noncontributory autopsy.
• Bear in mind that, although family history is a standard and important part of any diagnostic
evaluation, limited evidence exists to support a family history of sudden death as a risk factor
for BrS-associated arrhythmic events.[50]
Asymptomatic patients
Features of BrS may only be apparent when induced by certain factors.[1] [7] Inducible features are
particularly important to identify in asymptomatic patients (i.e., those who do not have a past history of
unexplained cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, or syncope), but may also be present in symptomatic
patients. These include:[1] [7]
• Febrile illness
• Known to induce type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG and precipitate arrhythmic events.[1] In
endemic regions, the prevalence of BrS in patients presenting with febrile illness for any
reason has been reportedly as high as 4%, around 20 times greater than a non-febrile
control group in one Thai cross-sectional study of 401 patients.[20] [21] While in isolation
fever is not specific for BrS, in a patient with suspected BrS, it has implications for both
diagnosis and management.[1]
• Medications
• These include sodium-channel blockers (e.g., flecainide, procainamide), psychotropic
medications (e.g., tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, lithium), and local anesthetics.
• Known to induce type 1 Brugada ECG changes, and may also precipitate arrhythmic
events.[1] [18]
• Illicit drugs or alcohol

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
• Known to induce type 1 Brugada ECG changes and may also precipitate arrhythmic
events.[1] [18]
Physical examination
Perform a full cardiovascular examination to identify other causes of the patient’s clinical presentation.
These include:
• Acute coronary syndrome
• Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
• Athlete’s heart
• Hemodynamically significant valvular disease
• Pectus excavatum
• Incomplete right bundle branch block.
Although the physical examination is valuable in the overall evaluation of any patient, it is not useful to rule
out or rule in a diagnosis of BrS.
Check whether the patient has a fever, which may unmask features of BrS.[1]
Initial investigations
ECG
Perform an ECG as the first line investigation for any patient with suspected BrS.[1][5] [7] [18] [64] Look
for the following patterns that may indicate BrS:[1] [7]
• Type 1: coved ST-segment elevation (J-point elevation with a gradual down-sloping ST-segment) ≥2
mm with a negative T-wave in the right precordial leads.[1] [4] [5] [7] [51]
• Type 1 Brugada pattern may be spontaneous, or induced (e.g., by factors such as fever or
sodium-channel blockers).[1] [5] [7]
• Type 2 or 3: saddleback ST-segment configuration with variable levels of ST-segment elevation.[1]
[4] [51]
Consider high precordial lead testing if ECG using standard lead placement is not conclusive and you
have a high clinical suspicion of BrS. High precordial lead testing increases diagnostic yield by accounting
for anatomic variations in right ventricular outflow tract anatomy.[1] [4] [5] [65] [66] [67]

electrophysiologist.
• The diagnosis of BrS is considered probable or definite if spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern is

require diagnostic evaluation by a specialist.
• Ensure you establish the patient’s clinical history in all patients with type 1 Brugada pattern.[4] 
• This is essential, because distinguishing type 1 Brugada pattern from other causes of ST elevation
using ECG alone can be difficult, even for an experienced cardiologist.[4]

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• If the patient has induced type 1 Brugada pattern, additional information is key to aid diagnosis of
BrS (e.g., relevant clinical history or family history, and/or genetic testing).[1]
If the patient has type 2 or 3 Brugada pattern, consider provocative drug testing with sodium channel
blockade (see below).[1] [18]
Echocardiogram
Organize an echocardiogram for any patient being evaluated for BrS to assess for underlying structural
heart disease and to rule out other causes of their presentation.[1] [49] Echocardiogram is often normal in
BrS or may demonstrate mild structural abnormalities in the right ventricle or right ventricular outflow tract.
Other investigations
Provocative drug testing with sodium channel blockade
Consider provocative drug testing with sodium-channel blockers (e.g., procainamide, flecainide) for any
patient with both:[1] [7] [13] [18][49]
• Type 2 or 3 Brugada pattern on ECG
AND
• Suspected BrS due to relevant clinical signs, symptoms, or family history.
The diagnosis of BrS is considered probable in these patients if type 1 Brugada ECG pattern is provoked
during drug testing with sodium-channel blockers; this scores two points on the Shanghai score.[1] Refer
these patients to a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist.
Due to an associated risk of inducing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, provocative drug testing
should only be performed by experts under optimal circumstances.[68]
Sodium-channel blocker test is not recommended in patients with a prior type I Brugada pattern.[7]
Genetic testing
Arrange genetic testing in patients with type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG (spontaneous or induced);
this helps facilitate family screening of first degree relatives.[1] [18] [69] However, the presence of a
susceptible gene mutation is not diagnostic of BrS. This is in part due to only 50% penetrance of genetic
variants. Clinical presentation remains central to diagnosing Brugada syndrome.[1]
Probable pathogenic mutation in a BrS susceptibility gene also scores 0.5 points on the Shanghai
score.[1] Mutations of many genes have been implicated in BrS, but only SCN5A gene variants are
considered definitely disease-causing.[1] [7] However, identifiable SCN5A variants are only found in
approximately 20% to 30% of patients with BrS.[1] [7] [16] [17] [18][64] Mutations of other genes only
account for around 2% to 5% of cases.[14] [16] [17][19]
Advanced cardiac imaging (MRI or CT)
Consider other advanced imaging modalities, such as cardiac MRI or CT, if the diagnosis of BrS is
uncertain to help differentiate BrS from other differentials, such as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.[36]

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
Invasive EP studies with inducibility testing (including measurement of baseline intervals, programmed
electrical stimulation [PES], and electroanatomic mapping) may be considered following consultation with
an electrophysiologist or cardiologist with expertise in managing BrS if the patient has asymptomatic BrS
and is deemed intermediate risk on risk stratification. See Management approach  for more information
about risk stratification.[7] [64] Although there is debate regarding the prognostic value of PES in primary
electrical diseases, there is some evidence to consider its use in BrS.[64] [71]
Invasive EP assessments have demonstrated voltage abnormalities recorded from the right ventricular
epicardium of patients with BrS in the absence of cardiac MR or CT structural abnormalities.[38] This
highlights the importance of expert consultation if you suspect BrS, but the diagnosis is unclear.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
past history of unexplained cardiac arrest or documented PMVT or VF
(common)
• Consider a diagnosis of symptomatic Brugada syndrome (BrS) if a patient has a past history of
unexplained cardiac arrest, or documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT), or ventricular
fibrillation (VF).[1] [5] [7]
• • There are many causes of sudden cardiac arrest, PMVT and VF, but BrS should be considered
as a differential, particularly if there is Brugada pattern on ECG and one or more risk factors for
BrS.
• Patients may also present with monomorphic VT, but this is rare and should prompt investigation
of other arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies.[5] [52] [53]
cardiogenic syncope (common)
• Consider a diagnosis of symptomatic Brugada syndrome (BrS) if a patient presents with, or has a past
history of cardiogenic syncope.
• • Up to one third of patients with BrS present with, or have a history of, syncope at the time of
diagnosis.[54]
• Take a careful history to differentiate cardiogenic from noncardiogenic causes of syncope.[1] [7]
The published Shanghai score for BrS assigns two points to patients with suspected cardiogenic
syncope, and one point to those with an unclear cause of syncope (see Criteria ).[1] [49]
• Patients with BrS who have a history of cardiogenic syncope are also at 2.5 to 5-fold greater
risk of serious arrhythmic events compared with those with noncardiogenic syncope.[48] [47]
[56] [57] Patients with cardiogenic syncope have not been shown to have an increased risk for
serious arrhythmic events.[58]
Other diagnostic factors
inducible features of Brugada syndrome (common)
• Features of Brugada syndrome (BrS) may only be apparent when induced by certain factors.[1] [7]
Inducible features are particularly important to identify in asymptomatic patients (i.e., those who do not

DIAGNOSIS
have a past history of unexplained cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, or syncope), but may also
be present in symptomatic patients. These include:[1] [7]
• • Febrile illness. This is known to induce type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG and precipitate
arrhythmic events.[1] In endemic regions, the prevalence of BrS in patients presenting with
febrile illness for any reason has been reportedly as high as 4%, approximately 20-fold greater
than a nonfebrile control group in one Thai cross-sectional study of 401 patients.[20] [21] While
in isolation fever is not specific for BrS, in a patient with suspected BrS, it has implications for
both diagnosis and management.[1]
• Medications. These include sodium-channel blockers (e.g., flecainide, procainamide),
psychotropic medications (e.g., tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, lithium), and local
anesthetics. These are known to induce type 1 Brugada ECG changes and may also precipitate
arrhythmic events.[1] [18]
• Illicit drugs or alcohol. These are known to induce type 1 Brugada ECG changes and may also
precipitate arrhythmic events.[1] [18]
atrial arrhythmias (uncommon)
• Consider a diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS) in a patient <30 years who has atrial fibrillation or
flutter.[1] [59] [60] Concomitant atrial arrhythmias are common in patients with BrS, with a prevalence
of approximately 10%, although these are not specific for diagnosis of BrS.[61] [64] Use of sodium-
channel blockers may unmask Brugada pattern on ECG in some of these patients.[61]
nocturnal agonal respirations (uncommon)
• Can be a feature of Brugada syndrome (BrS).[1] [7]
• The Shanghai score for BrS assigns 2 points to patients with nocturnal agonal respirations
(see Criteria ).[1] [49]
• In a Danish national survey, prevalence of nocturnal agonal respirations in patients with BrS was 14%,
but this is likely to be greater in endemic areas.[61]
• Nocturnal agonal respirations were described in early reports from Southeast Asia (Philippines,
Thailand, Japan, China, and others) of sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), a
syndrome which is thought to be genetically, phenotypically, and functionally the same as BrS.[63]
Risk factors
Weak
age 30 to 50 years
• Brugada syndrome (BrS) is typically first diagnosed in young to middle-aged patients.[1]
• Patients aged 30-50 years with BrS are also at high risk of serious arrhythmic events.[39] This is also
typically the age at which patients with BrS may present with their first serious arrhythmic event.[1]
 However, serious arrhythmic events have also been reported in children as young as <1 year old.[21]
[40] [41] Women in particular may be more likely to have their first SAE in childhood, or later in life.[1]
[39]
• Patients >50 years who have BrS experience significantly fewer serious arrhythmic events compared
with younger patients, and for those ≥55 years at the time of BrS diagnosis, annual mortality is similar
to that of the general population.[41] [42] [43] However, it remains unclear whether these observations
are due to protective effects acquired through aging or simply represent selection bias.

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
male sex
• Brugada syndrome (BrS) is more common in men compared with women.[1] [39] Men account for up
to 90% of cases of BrS in some cohorts.[1] [39]
• Evidence has shown that men with BrS are also at increased risk of serious arrhythmic events.[44] [45]
[46] However, this finding remains controversial, and has not been confirmed with complete adjustment
for potential confounding factors.[47] [48]
Asian ancestry
• Brugada syndrome (BrS) occurs more commonly in Asia compared with Europe and the US.[1] [13]
 BrS is particularly common in Southeast Asia, where a nocturnal sudden death syndrome in young
men was clinically reported by a variety of local names in countries such as Philippines, Thailand,
Japan, and China, prior to the formal classification of BrS.[14]
family history of BrS or suspicious or unexplained cardiac death
• Determine the following features (which form part of the Shanghai score; see Criteria ) in any first- or
second- degree relative of the patient.[1] [49]
• • Definite Brugada syndrome (BrS)
• Suspicious sudden cardiac death (febrile, nocturnal, confounded by BrS-associated drug)
• Unexplained sudden cardiac death <45 years with non-contributory autopsy.
• Bear in mind that, although family history is a standard and important part of any diagnostic evaluation,
limited evidence exists to support a family history of sudden cardiac death as a risk factor for BrS-
associated arrhythmic events.[50]

• Perform an ECG as the first line investigation for any patient with
suspected Brugada syndrome (BrS).[1][5] [7] [18] [64] Look for type
1, 2, or 3 Brugada patterns, which may indicate BrS.[1]
• Type 1 Brugada pattern may be spontaneous or induced (e.g., by
factors such as fever or sodium-channel blockers).[1] [5] [7]
• Consider high precordial lead testing if ECG using standard lead
placement is not conclusive and you have high clinical suspicion
of BrS. High precordial lead testing increases diagnostic yield by
accounting for anatomic variations in right ventricular outflow tract
anatomy.[1] [4] [5] [65] [66] [67]

• Refer all patients with type 1 Brugada pattern (spontaneous or
induced) to a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist.
• • The diagnosis of BrS is considered probable or definite if
spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern is recorded on ECG from
the 2nd to 4th intercostal spaces.[1][4] [51] [7] However, these
patients require diagnostic evaluation by a specialist.
• Ensure you establish the patient’s clinical history in all patients
with type 1 Brugada pattern.[4] This is essential, because
distinguishing type 1 Brugada pattern from other causes of
ST elevation using ECG alone can be difficult, even for an
experienced cardiologist.[4]
• If the patient has induced type 1 Brugada pattern, additional
information is key to aid diagnosis of BrS (e.g., relevant clinical
history or family history, and/or genetic testing).[1] [7]
• If the patient has type 2 or 3 Brugada pattern, consider provocative
drug testing with sodium channel blockade (see below).[1]

Proposed Shanghai Score for diagnosis of Brugada syndrome

Screening
Screen all first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with Brugada syndrome (BrS) or unexplained sudden
cardiac death.[1] [79] Be aware that familial screening is primarily done through clinical rather than genetic
screening.[1] This is because:[1]
• The presence of a pathogenic variant in a BrS susceptibility gene in isolation is not diagnostic for BrS
• If a pathogenic variant is identified in a family, the penetrance is approximately 50%, and conversely
family members who do not have the variant may still have BrS.
Clinical screening should include standard- and high-lead ECG testing and consideration of provocative drug
testing with sodium channel blockade.[1] [7]

Brugada syndrome Diagnosis
• For adult family members, screening does not usually need to be repeated if provocative sodium
channel blockade testing is negative.[1]
• Pediatric family members should undergo standard- and high-lead ECG screening at age 3 years.[1]
If this is negative, they should undergo additional screening every 3 years until age 15 years.[1]
Provocative sodium channel blockade testing should not be used until they are age >15 years due to
higher risk of adverse events compared with adults.[1] If provocative sodium channel blockade testing
is negative in a person >15 years, screening does not need to be repeated.[1]
Arrange genetic testing in all patients with type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG (spontaneous or induced) to
facilitate family screening.[1] [18] [69][79] However, the presence of a susceptible gene mutation is not
diagnostic of Brugada syndrome. This is in part due to only 50% penetrance of genetic variants. Clinical
presentation remains central to diagnosing Brugada syndrome.[1]
• Probable pathogenic mutation in a BrS susceptibility gene also scores 0.5 points on the Shanghai
score (see Criteria ).[1]
• Mutations of many genes have been implicated in BrS, but only SCN5A gene variants are considered
definitely disease-causing.[1] [7][79] However, identifiable SCN5A variants are only found in
approximately 20% to 30% of patients with BrS.[1] [7][16] [17] [18]
• Mutations of other genes only account for around 2% to 5% of cases.[14] [16] [17][19]

Brugada syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Treatment for patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) consists of conservative management and primary and
secondary prevention of serious arrhythmic events.[1] This aims to prevent serious arrhythmic events, while
avoiding potential complications of any treatments.[1] Potential treatments include implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD), pharmacologic therapy, and radiofrequency catheter ablation.[1] [7]
Note that the distinction between confirmed and probable BrS is not significant in determining the
management; this is guided by the patient’s presentation, particularly whether they are symptomatic or
asymptomatic. Most patients who are asymptomatic require conservative management only.[1] [18]
Management summary for Brugada syndrome
Adapted from Krahn AD et al. J Am Coll Cardiol EP. 2022 Mar, 8 (3) 386-405; used with permission
Acute ventricular arrhythmia
Intravenous isoproterenol should be given during an acute ventricular arrhythmia, including electrical
storm (>2 episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in 24 hours) if the mechanism is due
to short-coupled premature ventricular complex-induced ventricular fibrillation.[1] [18] [51]
Quinidine should also be considered for patients who experience electrical storm.[1] [5] [51] [80] In
practice, this is given once they have been stabilized with isoproterenol.

Brugada syndrome Management
• Difficulty in obtaining quinidine can limit its use; phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors (cilostazol or
milrinone) may be considered as an alternative, although supportive data are limited.[1] [7]
Risk stratification
Risk stratify all patients to identify those who are at increased risk of serious arrhythmic events.[1] Risk
stratification can aid decision making for the management of Brugada syndrome, particularly when
considering an ICD for primary prevention of serious arrhythmic events.[1] [64]
There are currently no risk stratification tools that have proved effective in clinical practice.[1] The
Sieira risk score has been proposed for predicting sudden death in patients with BrS, but has not been
externally validated.[57] [81] [82][83] However, established features that are associated with the greatest
risk of serious arrhythmic events are:[1] [84] [85] [86] [87]
• Resuscitated cardiac arrest
• History of cardiogenic syncope
• Spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG.
Other features that are associated with increased risk of serious arrhythmic events are:[1]
• Sudden cardiac death in a young (<35 years) first-degree relative
• Greater "Brugada burden" on ECG, which includes:
• Presence of type 1 Brugada pattern ECG in the peripheral leads in addition to the right
precordial leads
• Higher proportion of spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern on ECGs during follow-up
• Other ECG markers such as early repolarization pattern and QRS fragmentation.[7] [64] [88]
Age and sex have limited effect on risk of serious arrhythmic events, although age ≥55 at diagnosis
is associated with a more benign prognosis, with no increased mortality compared with the general
population.[1]
Consider an electrophysiological study with programmed ventricular stimulation using up to two
extrastimuli for further risk stratification in some patients, although this remains controversial.[1][7] [18]
• It should not be used routinely because it is invasive and puts the patient at risk of complications,
as well as having issues around reproducibility of results.[1] One multicenter pooled analysis
showed that in patients with BrS, arrhythmias induced with electrophysiologic studies were
associated with a higher future risk of ventricular arrhythmia.[89]
• However, it may be useful in certain circumstances (e.g., where the decision to use an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator for primary prevention is unequivocal).[1] [18]
Conservative management
Use conservative management for all patients with definite/probable or suspected BrS, although some
patients may need other additional treatments alongside this.[1] [7] Asymptomatic patients with inducible
(particularly drug-induced) Brugada pattern on ECG usually require conservative management only.[1]
[18]
Conservative management includes:[1] [7]

Brugada syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
• Avoidance of drugs that could exacerbate the Brugada pattern (for further information see:  
[BrugadaDrugs.org: safe drug use and the Brugada syndrome] (https://www.brugadadrugs.org)
).[18] [51] These include:
• Antiarrhythmics (particularly sodium-channel blockers)
• Psychotropic drugs
• Anesthetics
• Certain over-the-counter drugs (e.g., antihistamines)
• Illicit drugs (e.g., cannabis, cocaine).
• Prompt treatment of fever[18] [51]
• Avoidance of metabolic disturbance (e.g., hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis)
• Avoidance of alcohol intoxication[18] [51]
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
An ICD is recommended for all patients with BrS who have been resuscitated from cardiac arrest for
secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death.[1] [7] [18] [51]
However, the decision to use an ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death due to BrS is
less clear cut and needs to weigh up the risk of serious arrhythmic events with the risk of ICD-related
complications.[1]
• ICD is generally recommended for patients who have:
• Spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG and a history of cardiogenic syncope,
particularly if this is likely to be due to ventricular arrhythmias[1][7] [18]
• Documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia with or without syncope.[7] [18]
[51]
• ICD should be considered in patients who:
• Have provoked type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG and a history of cardiogenic syncope[1] [7]
[18]
• Are asymptomatic and have a type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG, with high-risk features that
are considered relevant after consultation with an expert.[1] [7] In general, ICD should be
avoided in those patients without high risk features.[1] [51]
• Develop ventricular fibrillation during electrophysiological study with programmed ventricular
stimulation.[7] [51]
The patient’s life expectancy should also be taken into account; ICD may not be appropriate if meaningful
survival is <1 year.[18]
Regarding choice of ICD, a dual chamber system is recommended in most patients, particularly
those prone to atrial arrhythmias (e.g., those carrying the SN5CA gene).[1] However, a subcutaneous
device may be preferred in young patients who don’t require pacing, because this has a lower risk of
intravascular infection.[1]
Pharmacologic therapy

Brugada syndrome Management
Quinidine is a class 1a antiarrhythmic agent that has many effects.[1] The most significant of these is
inhibition of the cardiac transient outward potassium current, which prolongs the refractory period.[1]
Quinidine is useful to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, and may also be used for medical management of
atrial arrhythmias.[1] [51] It should be considered in patients who:[1] [5]
• Have an ICD and experience recurrent shocks[7] [18]
• Decline or are unsuitable for an ICD[7] [18] [51]
• Experience electrical storm (>2 episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in 24
hours).[51] See "Acute ventricular arrhythmia" above
• Are asymptomatic but have a spontaneous type I Brugada pattern on ECG[51]
• Experience asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia.[68]
Be aware that significant adverse effects and difficulty in obtaining the drug can limit its use.[1] [5]
• Monitor the patient's CBC for anemia and thrombocytopenia.[1]
Phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors
Phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors (cilostazol or milrinone) may be considered for patients with BrS (as an
alternative to quinidine); however, supportive data are limited.[1] [7]
Radiofrequency catheter ablation
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is indicated in patients who:
• Have recurrent ICD shocks, particularly if these are refractory to medical therapy[1] [5] [7] [18] [51]
• Experience serious arrhythmic events despite optimized medical therapy[1] [5]
• Are intolerant to, or would prefer not to have, medical therapy, or medical therapy is ineffective[1] [5]
• Have spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG and symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias who
are unsuitable for, or decline an ICD[18]
• Have a history of electrical storms.[51]
Significant contraindications to ablation include:[38]
• Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation caused by myocardial ischemia, fever, or hypokalemia
• Presence of structural heart disease
• Brain anoxic encephalopathy from cardiac arrests caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
A combined endocardial and epicardial approach has been shown to modify triggers and substrate for
ventricular arrhythmias.[1]
Genetic counseling
Arrange genetic counseling for all patients to facilitate screening of relatives.[1] [7] [18] [79] See
Screening .

supportive data are limited.[1] [7]
adjunct radiofrequency catheter ablation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Indicated in patients who:
• Have recurrent ICD shocks, particularly if
these are refractory to medical therapy[1]
[5] [7] [18] [51]
• Experience serious arrhythmic events
despite optimized medical therapy[1] [5]
• Are intolerant to or would prefer not to
have medical therapy, or medical therapy
is ineffective[1] [5]
• Have spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern
on ECG and symptomatic ventricular
arrhythmias who are unsuitable for or
decline an ICD[18]
• Have a history of electrical storms.[51]
» Significant contraindications to ablation
include:[38]
• Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
caused by myocardial ischemia, fever, or
hypokalemia
• Presence of structural heart disease.

Brugada syndrome Management
Acute
» A combined endocardial and epicardial
approach has been shown to modify triggers and
substrate for ventricular arrhythmias.[1]
Patient discussions
As part of conservative management, advise the patient to:[1] [7]
• Avoid drugs that could exacerbate the Brugada ECG pattern (for further information see: 
[BrugadaDrugs.org: safe drug use and the Brugada syndrome] (https://www.brugadadrugs.org)
).[18] [51]
• Antiarrhythmics (particularly sodium-channel blockers)
• Psychotropic drugs
• Anesthetics
• Certain over-the-counter drugs (e.g., antihistamines)
• Illicit drugs (e.g., cannabis, cocaine).
• Treat any fever promptly[18] [51]
• Avoid alcohol intoxication.[18] [51]
In addition, patients should discuss new medications with their cardiologist as appropriate.
Reassure patients that exercise is not a normal trigger for ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome.
However, a post-vagal state following exercise has been reported.
Advise patients to contact their care team urgently if they have palpitations, syncope, or seizures. In
addition, if they have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) they should also report any syncope or
ICD shocks.

Brugada syndrome Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Arrange yearly follow up with a cardiologist or electrophysiologist with expertise in Brugada syndrome.[1]
 In particular, symptoms such as palpitations, syncope, and seizures must be evaluated.
If a patient is taking quinidine, monitor their CBC for anemia and thrombocytopenia.[1]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atrial arrhythmias variable medium
Atrial arrhythmias occur in about 10% of patients with Brugada syndrome.[61] [93] [94]
serious arrhythmic events variable low
Brugada syndrome (BrS) is the cause of around 28% of cases of sudden cardiac death in patients with an
apparently normal heart and around 5% to 10% of cases of resuscitated cardiac arrest.[1] [91] [92] Around
1 in 25 patients with BrS have a history of cardiac arrest at time of initial diagnosis.[1] [54] Incidence of
sudden cardiac death in those without an ICD is approximately 0.19%.[83] Patients who have BrS and
cardiogenic syncope have an annual incidence of a serious arrhythmic event of about 1.4%.[1] The most
likely mechanism of serious arrhythmic events is ventricular fibrillation initiated by short-coupled premature
ventricular complexes.[1]
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)-related
complications
variable low
Patients who require an ICD tend to be <50 years old and are at risk of ICD-related complications (e.g.,
lead fracture, infection) and unnecessary ICD shocks. One meta-analysis found a 4.5% annual rate of
ICD-related complications and a 3.5% annual rate of inappropriate shocks.[95]
Prognosis
Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) who have genetic mutations of SCN5A tend to develop symptoms at a
younger age, and have more pronounced electrophysiologic defects (e.g., higher rate of spontaneous type 1
ECG pattern, significant conduction or repolarization abnormalities, increased atrial vulnerability) and a more
severe prognosis.[90]
Age ≥55 at diagnosis is associated with a more benign prognosis, with no increased mortality compared with
the general population.[1]
Established features that are associated with the greatest risk of serious arrhythmic events in patients with
BrS are:[1][40][85][86][87]
• Resuscitated cardiac arrest
• History of cardiogenic syncope
• Spontaneous type 1 Brugada pattern on ECG.

Figure 1: Electrocardiographic patterns in Brugada syndrome showing type 1 (diagnostic) and types 2 and
3 (non-diagnostic) patterns. Type-1 (diagnostic): coved STT morphology in lead V2 with J-point elevation
(dark gray line) of ≥0.2 mV (≥2 mm) and a terminal ST-segment elevation (light gray line, J+60 ms) also ≥0.2
mV (≥2 mm). Note the PR interval and wider QRS complex, wide and deep S in lead I, and fractionation
in the right precordial ECG leads. Type-2 (non-diagnostic): saddleback STT morphology in lead V2 with J-
point elevation (dark gray line) of ≥0.2 mV (≥2 mm) and a terminal ST-segment elevation (light gray line, J
+60 ms) ≥0.1 mV (≥1 mm), followed by a positive T wave. Note the less wide and deep S-wave in lead I,
less prominent fractionation. Type-3 (non-diagnostic): saddleback STT morphology in lead V2 with J-point
elevation (dark gray line) of ≥0.2 mV (≥2 mm) and a terminal ST-segment elevation (light gray line, J+60 ms)
<0.1 mV (<1 mm)

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
