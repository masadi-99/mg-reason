Evaluation of palpitations Overview
Summary
Palpitations are defined as the abnormal awareness of one's own heartbeat. It is a common complaint
seen in the outpatient setting in virtually all age groups and demographics. Most palpitations are due to
nonarrhythmic etiologies that occur during normal sinus rhythm.
A significant proportion of palpitations are due to non-life-threatening, treatable cardiac conditions. They
include premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, and supraventricular tachycardias
such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, and
atrioventricular reentry tachycardia or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Ironically, the most common rhythm
seen when evaluating patients for palpitations is sinus rhythm. A heightened sense of normal rhythm can
be seen in settings of emotional or physical stress, or in conjunction with use of caffeine, alcohol, or other
stimulants.
However, palpitations are occasionally a manifestation of potentially life-threatening conditions, especially in
the setting of structural heart disease - for example, ventricular tachycardia (VT), which may lead to sudden
cardiac death. Inherited conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, and long QT
syndrome may also initially present with palpitations and carry a risk of sudden cardiac death.[1] [2]
Palpitations associated with syncope are particularly worrying as they are more likely to be associated with
malignant arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and should also be urgently evaluated.
The evaluation of palpitations includes a careful and directed history and physical exam and a 12-lead
ECG. Further testing and treatment should be guided by this initial evaluation, and includes ambulatory
electrocardiographic monitoring and electrophysiologic testing.

Evaluation of palpitations Theory
THEORY
Etiology
Palpitations can be caused by cardiac disorders or noncardiac disorders.[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Cardiac etiologies
are classified by site of origin and include supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) and ventricular tachycardias
(VTs), as well as premature atrial and ventricular depolarizations. Cardiac arrhythmias are also common in
the setting of structural heart disease.[8]
Noncardiac causes include panic attacks, anxiety disorder, anemia, fever, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia,
and electrolyte imbalance.[9] Panic disorder may cause palpitations in 20% of patients.[7] In addition, many
patients with palpitations have a history of panic attacks.[10] However, psychiatric diagnoses such as panic
attack or anxiety disorder should not be accepted as the sole etiologies of palpitations until true arrhythmic
causes have been excluded.[11] [12]
Primary cardiac arrhythmias
SVTs
• Sinus tachycardia: the most common etiology of palpitations, defined as a heart rate >100 bpm with an
identifiable cause such as exercise, stress, or some pathologic state e.g., anemia.
• Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: defined as a resting heart rate >100 bpm, or an exaggerated heart
response to exercise, without an identifiable etiology for the tachycardia such as pregnancy, anemia,
or hyperthyroidism. Etiology is unknown but may be due to autonomic nervous system dysfunction or
sinus node abnormality. A related syndrome is the postural orthostatic syndrome where inappropriate
tachycardia is demonstrated in response to posture on a tilt-table test.
• Atrial tachycardia: frequently seen in patients with structural heart disease or in the setting of an acute
illness, such as infection. It is much more common in older people. Alternatively, it can be described
as incessant with symptoms that are less specific such as fatigue and shortness of breath. Incessant
atrial tachycardia can sometimes lead to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
• Atrial flutter: commonly seen in patients with atrial fibrillation.[13] [14]
• Atrial fibrillation: frequently seen in the setting of congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, thyroid disease, and pulmonary disease. Prevalence increases with
older age.[13] [15] [16] [17] Tall stature and high aerobic fitness level, alone and in combination, are
associated with increased risk.[18] [19] [20] [21]
• Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia: can occur at any age, although most commonly presents
in the late 20s or early 30s.[22] Palpitations typically have an abrupt initiation and termination.
• Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia: a reentrant SVT using an anomalous bypass tract between the
atria and ventricles. When evidence of this bypass tract is seen as a delta wave on the ECG, and the
patient has palpitations, it is referred to as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. It is important to note that
this condition can be present without visible delta waves on the baseline ECG, due to what is referred
to as a “concealed” bypass tract; where the bypass does not conduct in the antegrade direction, and
the ventricle is not preexcited. However, the bypass tract has retrograde conduction that will support
an orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is more frequently seen
in males in the late teens or early twenties, and is associated with a slight increase in incidence of
sudden cardiac death.[23] [24]
VTs
• Reentrant VT due to cardiomyopathy (most often due to coronary artery disease with prior infarction).
• Brugada syndrome: a familial syndrome that has an associated risk of sudden cardiac death.[2]

Evaluation of palpitations Theory
• Long QT syndrome (LQTS): palpitations are due to episodes of nonsustained polymorphic VT, often
with associated syncope.[2] LQTS increases predisposition to sudden cardiac death and may be
congenital or acquired. Classic triggers exist for episodes in familial syndromes; triggers depend on
the underlying genotype. In LQTS 1, episodes occur during exercise. In LQTS 2, they often occur with
arousal from sleep or during emotional stress. A number of pharmacotherapeutic agents have been
implicated in acquired LQTS; it is essential to evaluate the patient's medications for drugs that may
prolong the QT interval, such as macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, or certain antipsychotics.
• Idiopathic VT: several different types of idiopathic VT exist, classified by site of origin. These include
right ventricular outflow tract VT, left ventricular outflow tract VT, and left ventricular idiopathic VT,
sometimes referred to as Belhassen VT or verapamil-sensitive VT, which originates from the left
ventricular myocardium.
Other cardiac causes
• Premature ventricular contractions: one of the most common etiologies of palpitations; can be seen in
normal hearts as well as in patients with structural heart disease.
• Premature atrial contractions: one of the most common etiologies of palpitations; can be seen in
normal hearts as well as in patients with structural heart disease.
Structural cardiac disorders
• Myocardial infarction: VT is often seen in the acute setting. A myocardial scar from a previous
infarction predisposes a patient to VT due to reentry, causing palpitations. Patients with prior
myocardial infarction, especially those that develop congestive heart failure, are also especially prone
to developing atrial fibrillation and flutter.[1] [25] [26] [27]
• Dilated cardiomyopathy: associated with increased frequency of VT and atrial fibrillation.[1] [28] [29]
• Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: may be familial, marked by left ventricular hypertrophy that
can present with a variety of arrhythmias that lead to palpitations, as well as dyspnea on exertion,
near-syncope, and syncope.[30] The arrhythmias can be supraventricular such as atrial fibrillation,
premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular (typically nonsustained VT).[1]
• Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: although rare, frequently presents with palpitations
as the initial symptom.[1][31] [32]
• Mitral valve prolapse: palpitations (often due to SVTs), and premature ventricular contractions are
frequently seen in this disorder, particularly when significant mitral regurgitation is present.[1][33] [34]
[35] [36]
• Ebstein anomaly (congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve annulus): atrioventricular bypass tracts
are associated with this condition, frequently resulting in atrioventricular reentry tachycardia.[1] [37]
• Valvular abnormalities (stenotic or regurgitant): commonly lead to atrial enlargement, which
predisposes to atrial fibrillation and flutter.[1] [13] [25]
• Congenital heart defects: repaired or unrepaired atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and
tetralogy of Fallot can lead to VT by reentry around surgical scars or atrial tachyarrhythmias due to
significant atrial enlargement.[1][38][39]
• Pericarditis: atrial fibrillation can be precipitated, especially after cardiac surgery.[1] [40] [41]
• Cardiac surgery: any cardiac surgery that involves an incision, such as cannulation of the atria for
initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, or exposure of the mitral valve, results in scarring that may
become a substrate for a reentrant tachycardia.

Noncardiac causes
Include the following:[9][42]
• Panic disorder
• Anxiety disorder
• Anemia
• Fever
• Hyperthyroidism: can cause sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation
• Pheochromocytoma: palpitations associated with sweating and headache
• Alcohol use: even modest alcohol consumption has been found to increase the risk of atrial
fibrillation[43]
• Medication: drugs that prolong the QT interval may precipitate polymorphic VT; drugs that contain
omega-3-acid ethyl esters, particularly at high doses, increase the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients
being treated for hypertriglyceridemia[44] [45][46] [47]
• Caffeine use: although many patients experience increased palpitations following caffeine
consumption, the epidemiology and physiology behind this are unclear[48]
• Electrolyte imbalance: electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia)
predispose patients to many arrhythmias from premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular
contractions to atrial fibrillation, and often incite and/or contribute to VT

Evaluation of palpitations Emergencies
Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
In certain situations urgent diagnosis and treatment are indicated. Patients found to be in a sustained
tachycardia (defined as tachycardia lasting >30 seconds) should be triaged to an appropriate setting, such
as the emergency department, and connected to a cardiac monitor. Oxygen saturation and blood pressure
should be monitored and appropriate resuscitation given if required. An immediate 12-lead ECG should be
performed. Monitoring of urine output should also be considered, especially if the patient is hemodynamically
unstable. The treatment given will depend on the arrhythmia diagnosed.
It is often the clinician's first instinct to terminate the arrhythmia before obtaining an ECG; however, unless
the patient is hemodynamically unstable, there is almost always enough time to perform a 12-lead ECG,
which will be useful in diagnosis and subsequent management.
Palpitations associated with syncope are particularly worrying as they are more likely to be associated with
malignant arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and should be urgently evaluated.

Evaluation of palpitations Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
History
Important points to be noted on history include:[1] [49]
• Rate and degree of regularity of palpitations: sustained, rapid, irregular palpitations may indicate atrial
fibrillation or atrial flutter, whereas rapid, regular rhythms may indicate paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia (SVT)
• Nature of palpitations: feeling of flip-flopping in the chest, often described as the heart stopping and
then starting again, or as a skipped beat with the sensation of a pounding beat, a “clunk” or a “thud”,
usually indicates premature ventricular contractions or premature atrial contractions. A feeling of
rapid fluttering in the chest may indicate atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia.
Patients often use terms such as "mechanical" or "shifting into gear", which are highly suggestive
of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia or atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. Symptoms that
terminate abruptly, especially with a Valsalva maneuver, suggest a reentrant mechanism in which
the AV node is involved (such as atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia or atrioventricular reentry
tachycardia). Symptoms that "just seem to fade away" are often due to sinus tachycardia
• A feeling of rapid and regular pounding in the neck: typical of reentrant supraventricular arrhythmias,
particularly atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia. The sensation is due to atrioventricular
dissociation producing contraction of the atria against closed tricuspid and mitral valves.
Atrioventricular dissociation can also result from isolated premature ventricular contractions or
sustained ventricular tachycardias (VTs)
• Palpitations that follow feelings of panic: suggest a diagnosis of panic disorder, although it is often
difficult for patients to distinguish whether the feeling of anxiety or panic precedes or follows the
palpitations. Certain psychiatric disorders such as panic attack or anxiety disorder are common causes
of palpitations, but these diagnoses should not be accepted as sole etiologies of palpitations until true
arrhythmic causes have been excluded[11] [12]
• Palpitations brought on by exercise (catecholamine excess): suggests an idiopathic VT, particularly
those arising from the right ventricular outflow tract.[50] Long QT syndrome can also present with
palpitations triggered by vigorous exercise.[2] SVTs, particularly atrial fibrillation, may be induced
during exercise or at the termination of exercise when the withdrawal of catecholamines is coupled
with a surge in vagal tone. This is more common in athletic men in the third to the sixth decade
of life.[51] [52] [53] Palpitations during minimal exertion or emotional stress can also indicate
inappropriate sinus tachycardia. This arrhythmia is characterized by inappropriate increases in sinus
rates. It is most frequently seen in young women and may result from a hypersensitivity to beta-
adrenergic stimulation
• Palpitations on awakening (typically early in the morning): there is a well-described association
between atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea, likely due to large variations in sympathetic
and vagal tone at the time of the apneic episode. The coexistence of these two conditions should be
considered in patients with risk factors for sleep apnea who awake from sleep with palpitations[54]
• Precipitation by emotional stress: most frequently due to anxiety, but may also suggest long QT
syndrome with polymorphic VT[55]
• Association with position: patients with atrioventricular nodal tachycardia often develop the arrhythmia
when they bend over. Some patients note a pounding sensation while lying in bed, particularly when
in the supine or left lateral decubitus position. This symptom may be the result of premature beats,

which occur more frequently at slow heart rates, and is believed to be due to the sensation of the left
ventricle against the thoracic wall
• Polyuria: SVT often results in atrial distension and release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),
precipitating a significant diuresis[56] [57]
• Dizziness, presyncope, or syncope: should prompt a search for VT. Occasionally, syncope occurs with
SVT, particularly at the beginning of the tachycardia[1]
• Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or other structural heart disease are at increased
risk of sudden cardiac death, and complaints of palpitations may be due to premature ventricular
contractions and/or nonsustained VT. The etiology of palpitations should be aggressively sought,
as well as risk-stratification for sudden cardiac death and treatment with an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator if indicated
• Patients with a history of congenital heart disease (repaired or unrepaired) are prone to multiple types
of arrhythmias. Those with chronic volume overload are prone to atrial enlargement leading to atrial
fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia. Patients with repaired ventricular septal defects or
tetralogy of Fallot are prone to reentrant VT around the ventricular septal defect patch, or from the site
of pulmonic valve repair in the right ventricular infundibulum in the case of repaired tetralogy of Fallot
• Family history of arrhythmia, syncope, or sudden death from cardiac causes: suggests cardiomyopathy
or channelopathy such as long QT syndrome
• History suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as weight loss, heat intolerance, increased frequency of
bowel movements
• Alcohol use: a significant risk factor for atrial fibrillation[13] [43]
• Excessive caffeine use
• Medication history: stimulants or stimulant-containing medications such as diet pills, or other
medications that prolong the QT interval and lead to polymorphic VT (torsades de pointes) such as
macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.[44]
Drugs containing omega-3-acid ethyl esters increase the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients treated for
hypertriglyceridemia.[45][46] [47]
Physical exam
Although physicians rarely have the opportunity to examine a patient during an episode of palpitations, the
physical exam is useful to define potential cardiovascular abnormalities. Important points on examination
include:
• Heart rate and rhythm
• Blood pressure
• General examination: pallor, fever, signs of hyperthyroidism such as warm and sweaty skin, thinning
hair and skin, exophthalmos, eyelid lag, pretibial myxedema
• Jugular venous pulse: cannon A waves, seen as a bulging in the neck (sometimes termed a frog
sign; occurs when the atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid or mitral valve) as in atrioventricular
dissociation[58] [59]
• Cardiac examination: a laterally displaced and diffuse point of maximal impulse indicates dilated
cardiomyopathy. Auscultation may reveal the midsystolic click of mitral valve prolapse.[33] [34] A
harsh holosystolic murmur heard along the left sternal border that increases with Valsalva maneuver
indicates hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. There may be signs of congestive heart failure
such as an S3. Mitral stenosis and regurgitation both lead to left atrial enlargement, which is
associated with atrial fibrillation

12-lead ECG
The initial evaluation of all patients with a history of palpitations should include a 12-lead ECG, which can
be diagnostic if an arrhythmia correlating with palpitations is recorded. 12-lead ECG also helps to narrow the
differential diagnosis in patients with normal sinus rhythm.[1]
Important points to note on ECG include:
• Bradycardia: any bradycardia can be accompanied by premature ventricular contractions and
palpitations. In particular, complete heart block can be associated with premature ventricular
contractions, prolonged QT intervals, and torsades de pointes

Further diagnostic testing
Further diagnostic testing should be performed for four groups of people:[1] [60] [61] [62]
• When the initial diagnostic evaluation (history, physical exam, and ECG) suggests an arrhythmic
cause, especially if the palpitations are associated with syncope.
• Those who are at high risk for an arrhythmia without a clear diagnosis after the initial evaluation. This
includes people with structural heart disease or myocardial abnormalities including scar formation
from myocardial infarction, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, clinically significant valvular regurgitant
or stenotic lesions or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; these conditions can lead to serious arrhythmias,
especially VT. Other high-risk patients include those with a family history of arrhythmia, syncope, or
sudden death from cardiac causes (e.g., cardiomyopathy or the long QT syndrome).
• Those patients with factors associated with a high-risk of thrombotic complications from atrial
fibrillation in whom, if the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is established, require antithrombotic therapy.
• Low-risk patients who are anxious to have a specific explanation for their symptoms.
Modes of further testing include ambulatory monitoring, implantable event monitors, laboratory tests, imaging
and electrophysiology studies.
Ambulatory monitoring

Evaluation of palpitations Diagnosis
Ambulatory monitoring is the definitive means for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias as the etiology of a
patient's palpitations as it demonstrates the patient's cardiac rhythm during the symptoms. Low-risk patients
should have ambulatory monitoring only if the history suggests a sustained arrhythmia that is significantly
bothersome to the patient. Even if the patient is low risk and the history is suggestive of premature atrial
contractions or premature ventricular contractions, it is sometimes necessary to document this in order to
reassure the patient that the palpitations have a benign cause. This can be highly therapeutic in the patient
who is excessively concerned about their risk of dangerous arrhythmia.[1] Several types of monitoring
systems are available:[63]
• Holter monitors: 24-hour monitoring systems that record and save data continuously. They are worn for
1 to 2 days while the patient keeps a diary recording the time and characteristics of symptoms. They
are only effective for patients who have daily episodes.
• Event monitors or continuous-loop recorders: continuously record data but save the data only
when manually activated by the patient during an episode of palpitations. Some models will also
automatically record any episodes of arrhythmia, whether symptomatic or not. Although Holter
monitors remain popular in clinical practice, continuous-loop recorders are generally more cost
effective and effective for the evaluation of intermittent palpitations.[64] [65] They can be used for
longer periods than Holter monitors and are more likely to record data during palpitations, as most
patients with palpitations are not symptomatic every day. A monitoring period of 2 weeks is sufficient to
make a diagnosis in many patients.[66]
• Mobile continuous outpatient telemetry: offers continuous ECG monitoring and recognizes arrhythmias
according to prescribed algorithms. Continuous telemetry offers greater sensitivity by 1) recognizing
arrhythmias that are asymptomatic, and 2) capturing arrhythmias in patients who are not able to
manually activate a loop monitor.[67]
• Digital devices: increasingly play a role in the diagnosis of palpitations.[68] Many smart watches
can monitor heart rates, and the abrupt acceleration of the pulse in conjunction with symptoms of
palpitations suggests an arrhythmia. There are also commercially available devices that can record a
single and six channel ECG to evaluate in correlation with symptoms.[69]
Implantable event monitors
Implantable event monitors are used for patients who have infrequent palpitations, such as only a few times
a year, but the palpitations are associated with worrisome symptoms such as syncope. In such a patient,
it may be necessary to establish a firm diagnosis of one of these rare events. These small monitors are
placed in the left prepectoral subcutaneous tissue and will automatically store ECGs of specific events such
as extreme tachycardia or bradycardia, or asystole. Any episode that the patient identifies as an episode of
palpitation will also be stored. These stored ECGs are then retrieved from the device memory when analyzed
through the use of telemetry.
Laboratory tests
Laboratory tests may also be useful to exclude specific underlying causes:
• Thyroid stimulating hormone: for evaluation of sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation
• CBC: anemia could be an explanation for sinus tachycardia
• Electrolyte profile: electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) often
incite and/or contribute to VT

Evaluation of palpitations Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Imaging studies that can be considered are:
• Transthoracic echocardiogram: may be indicated when there is evidence of ischemic heart disease
or if structural heart disease is suspected, but is rarely appropriate without other symptoms or signs
of heart disease.[70] This is of fundamental importance when risk stratifying patients for a malignant
etiology to their palpitations.
• Cardiac MRI: modality for assessing cardiac structure and function often with even greater fidelity
than echo. It has the advantage of being able to specifically characterize cardiac tissue, which is
particularly useful in diagnosing conditions such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy or
cardiac sarcoid. Cardiac scarring, as detected by MRI, is associated with increased risk of arrhythmias.
Evaluation with MRI should be reserved for situations in which such a diagnosis is suggested, but not
confirmed, by echocardiogram.
Electrophysiology studies
Electrophysiology studies, with or without preceding ambulatory monitoring, should be performed in two
situations:
• If palpitations are sustained or poorly tolerated and there is evidence of heart disease, particularly
with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%. An electrophysiology study can be performed to see
whether ventricular arrhythmias are inducible, in which case the patient would be a candidate for an
implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
• If an arrhythmia is identified that is treatable with ablation, such as atrial flutter, atrioventricular node
reentry tachycardia, or atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. An electrophysiology study should be
performed as the diagnostic part of a therapeutic ablation procedure.

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
