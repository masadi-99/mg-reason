Evaluation of mediastinal mass Overview
Summary
Mediastinal anatomy
The mediastinum is the thoracic space between the visceral pleura of the lungs. The boundaries of the
mediastinum are the visceral pleura, thoracic inlet (spine, first ribs, and manubrium), diaphragm, sternum,
and anterior spinal ligaments. The contents of the mediastinum include the heart, great vessels, trachea,
esophagus, thymus gland, lymphatic tissue, and nerves.
The International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) classification divides the mediastinum into
prevascular, visceral, and paravertebral compartments (which roughly correlate to the historic anterior,
middle, and posterior compartments, respectively).[1] [2]

Etiology
The etiology of a mediastinal mass can be suggested by its location within the mediastinum. A mass may
extend beyond the boundaries of these radiographically-defined compartments as it grows or invades;
however, in general, the differential of mediastinal masses can be narrowed by the location of its epicenter.

Thyroid masses (goiter, neoplasm)
Substernal thyroid goiter most commonly represents direct extension of the thyroid gland into the
prevascular (anterior) mediastinum. Goiters and ectopic thyroid tissue can also occur in the visceral (middle)
mediastinum. Follicular adenoma is the most common benign neoplasm in substernal goiters.[3] Malignancy
is present in 10% to 15% of substernal goiters.[4] [5] [6]

Lymphadenopathy (metastatic, lymphoma)
Lymphadenopathy may result in a mediastinal mass in any part of the mediastinum. Malignant etiology is
more common in older patients and patients with a prior history of cancer. Hematologic malignancies such as
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia may have associated B symptoms,
including fever, rash, night sweats, and weight loss.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia presents with acute onset of symptoms such as fatigue, bleeding, and recurrent
infections, due to cytopenias.
Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. It presents as a bulky
mass in the prevascular (anterior) mediastinum with symptoms related to compression of adjacent structures,
such as the superior vena cava (SVC), which can result in venous congestion of the head and upper
extremities causing SVC syndrome.[7]
Thoracic aortic aneurysm
Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a localized or diffuse dilatation of the aorta involving all layers of the vessel
wall. It may present as a mediastinal mass in the visceral (middle) or paravertebral (posterior) mediastinum.
Ascending aortic aneurysms are often caused by cystic medial degeneration or necrosis, which is often
associated with collagen vascular disorders. Descending aortic aneurysms are most often associated
with atherosclerotic disease. The natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysms involves continued gradual
expansion and increased risk for eventual rupture if left untreated.[8] [9]

Thymic masses (thymic neoplasm, thymic hyperplasia)
Thymic neoplasms, including thymoma and thymic carcinoma, account for 30% of prevascular (anterior)
mediastinal masses in adults and 15% of prevascular (anterior) mediastinal masses in children.[10] [11]
WHO classification of thymic tumors is used to classify thymic neoplasms into Types A, AB, B, or C (thymic
carcinoma), with increasingly worse prognosis.[12] The Masaoka-Koga staging scheme for thymomas is
often used to describe the extent of local extension.[13] Thymic neoplasms can occur in all age groups,
although they have a higher incidence in older people and have a slight male predominance.[14] [15] [16]

Mediastinal germ cell tumors
Extragonadal germ cell tumors are found along the body's midline and correspond to the embryologic
urogenital ridge. Mediastinal germ cell tumors constitute 50% to 70% of all extragonadal germ cell tumors,
and present in the anterior mediastinum.[17] [18] They are classified as benign or malignant. Benign
mediastinal germ cell tumors include mature teratoma. Malignant mediastinal germ cell tumors include
seminomas (dysgerminomas) and nonseminomas.
Mature teratomas can occur in any age group but are more common in children or young adults.[19] There is
no gender predilection for mature teratoma.

THEORY
Pure seminoma germ cell tumors account for 35% of malignant germ cell tumors.[20] They occur in younger
adults ages 20 to 40 years, with a male predominance.
Nonseminoma germ cell tumors include choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, and endodermal
sinus tumors.[21] They occur in younger adults ages 20-40 years and have a strong male predominance.
They can be associated with Klinefelter syndrome.[22]
The distinction between seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors influences the treatment
approach. Therefore, when these etiologies of mediastinal mass are suspected, a biopsy is usually
performed to guide the treatment strategy.
Cyst (bronchogenic, pericardial, esophageal)
Bronchogenic, pericardial, and esophageal cysts may present as a mass in the visceral (middle)
mediastinum. Although neoplastic transformation has been reported, this is generally not their natural history.
Symptoms are related to compression of adjacent structures, hemorrhage, or infection of the cyst.
Bronchogenic and esophageal cysts are embryonic bronchopulmonary or foregut malformations. These are
often removed once identified radiographically.
Pericardial cysts are thin-walled cysts that arise from the pericardium, and can be congenital or acquired.
These are often not intervened upon unless enlarging or causing symptoms from adjacent compression.

Tracheal tumors (benign or malignant)
Primary tracheal tumors can be benign or malignant and may present in the visceral (middle) mediastinum.
The majority of tracheal tumors are malignant, with adenoid cystic carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma
being the most common histologies.[23] The most common benign tracheal neoplasm is squamous
papilloma. Ninety percent of tracheal tumors in adults are malignant, compared with 10% to 30% in
children.[24]
Neurogenic tumors (paraganglioma)
Neurogenic tumors arise from peripheral nerves, autonomic ganglia, and embryonic remnants of the neural
tube. They may be benign or malignant and may present in the paravertebral (posterior) mediastinum.
Neurogenic tumors in children are often malignant, while tumors in adults tend to be benign.[25] Children
and young adults are more prone to tumors of autonomic ganglia (two-thirds of which are malignant). Adults
are more prone to nerve sheath tumors, which are almost all benign. Benign tumors include neurilemmoma,
schwannoma, pheochromocytoma, neurofibroma, ganglioneuroma, and granular cell tumor. Malignant
tumors include malignant schwannoma and neuroblastoma.
Lung cancer
Lung cancer often metastasizes to mediastinal lymph nodes, which represents stage III lung cancer.
Thorough mediastinal staging is essential for establishing appropriate therapy and prognosis.[26] [27] Small

Evaluation of mediastinal mass Emergencies
Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
Superior vena cava syndrome
Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome occurs when the SVC is occluded or compressed by a mediastinal
mass. Malignant tumors are commonly associated with SVC syndrome. In most cases, SVC syndrome is not
a medical emergency unless neurologic symptoms are present.[28] A biopsy should be obtained prior to the
initiation of therapy. Biopsies can often be obtained from percutaneous biopsy, sampling of more accessible
synchronous lesions, or via mediastinoscopy. Treatment is directed at the underlying disease process, with
consideration of endovascular SVC stent placement for acute severe symptoms until the primary tumor has
sufficiently shrunk to relieve compressive symptoms. 
Tracheal obstruction
Tracheal obstruction may occur from primary endoluminal tumor growth or from extrinsic compression. The
majority of tracheal tumors are malignant, with squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma being
the most common histologies.[23] Extrinsic tracheal compression can occur from tumors of surrounding
tissues such as thyroid, esophagus, lymph nodes, and lung.[29] [30] These malignancies may also directly
invade the trachea through local extension.
Symptoms of progressive or dynamic tracheal obstruction include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and stridor.
Acute respiratory distress may not be present until the trachea is almost completely occluded, and may prove
lethal without immediate intervention. Standard chest radiography is insensitive for the detection of tracheal
tumors.[31] Computed tomography (CT) scan is the imaging modality of choice, including both inspiratory
and expiratory imaging. Bronchoscopy, whether flexible or rigid, is the best way to visualize the degree of
tracheal obstruction, with the ability to concomitantly debulk the tumor through rigid bronchoscopy. Rapid
recognition and surgical intervention is required for near complete tracheal obstruction.[32]
Bronchial obstruction
Bronchial obstruction could occur from intrinsic or extrinsic tumor compression. Intraluminal bronchial tumors
are often malignant, with small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma being the most common
histologies. Extrinsic bronchial compression can occur from tumors of surrounding tissues, such as lymph
nodes and lung, or occasionally from an aneurysm. Symptoms include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and
wheezing.
Standard chest radiograph may identify a mass lesion with associated unilateral lung collapse. CT scan
is the imaging modality of choice.[31] Bronchial obstruction may be addressed surgically or with radiation
therapy after the underlying tumor is diagnosed.[33]
Thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture
The natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysms involves gradual expansion and eventual rupture if
untreated.[8] [9] When a thoracic aortic aneurysm ruptures, sudden death may ensue. Patients may present
with sudden-onset severe chest pain that may have a tearing character and radiate to the back. Syncope,
lightheadedness, and a feeling of impending doom may be present. Presenting signs include tachycardia,
hypotension, and shock.

Evaluation of mediastinal mass Emergencies
EMERGENCIES
Chest x-ray may show widened mediastinum.[34] CT angiogram of the chest is the test of choice to diagnose
a suspected rupture.[35] Emergent vascular or cardiothoracic surgery referral should be made if the
diagnosis is suspected on clinical grounds, and critical care maintained until surgery.[36]
Aortic dissection
Aortic dissection occurs when an intimal tear causes blood to enter into the intima-media space of the
aorta, resulting in a false lumen. The false lumen may extend in an antegrade (toward the descending
aorta) or retrograde (toward the aortic valve) direction. The most common causes of aortic dissection are
hypertension, congenital bicuspid aortic valve, and collagen vascular disorder.[37] [38]
Frequency by location of dissection has been reported as: ascending aorta 65%, descending aorta 20%,
aortic arch 10%, and abdominal aorta 5%.[39] Signs and symptoms depend on the location of dissection,
vascular branch involvement, and presence of rupture. Pain is almost universal and often described as
tearing or shearing with radiation to the back or neck.[40] [41] Regional ischemia may occur from branch
vessel involvement.
Chest x-ray may show widened mediastinum and/or displacement of aortic intimal calcification, but a normal
chest x-ray does not exclude the diagnosis. ECG is useful to exclude concomitant myocardial infarction.
Transesophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced CT
scan are the diagnostic modalities of choice.[42] In unstable patients who cannot be taken to the scanner,
transesophageal echocardiography can rapidly make the diagnosis. In more stable patients, a CT scan
or MRI can make the diagnosis as well as give more information regarding extent of dissection and arch
involvement, which are critical in operative planning.[43]
Once an aortic dissection is suspected, critical care and cardiothoracic surgery services should be
activated.[36]

Evaluation of mediastinal mass Diagnosis
Approach
Many mediastinal tumors are asymptomatic (incidental finding) or associated with only vague complaints.
The likelihood of malignancy depends on mass location, patient age, and the presence of symptoms.[11] [44]
[45]
Malignant masses are found in the prevascular (anterior), visceral (middle), and paravertebral (posterior)
mediastinum in approximately 60%, 30%, and 15% of cases, respectively.[10] Symptoms are present in 80%
to 90% of patients with malignant mediastinal tumors at presentation, compared with 46% of patients with
benign masses.[10]
Approximately 25% of patients with thymoma have myasthenia gravis, and 15% of patients with myasthenia
gravis have thymoma.[46] Neurogenic tumors are commonly observed in children. Acute lymphocytic
leukemia may occur in children (commonly <5 years) or adults. Lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
thymomas, and thyroid tumors tend to occur in adults.[47] [48]
History
Although many mediastinal tumors may be asymptomatic, certain symptoms may raise concern for a
mediastinal tumor and relate to its location. These include the following:
• Airway compression: dyspnea, stridor, hemoptysis, cough
• Esophageal compression: dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve compression: hoarse voice
• Superior vena cava obstruction: facial swelling, headache
• Sympathetic ganglion involvement: Horner syndrome, in which the patient may note pupillary
constriction (miosis), drooping eyelids (ptosis), and absence of sweating (anhidrosis)
• Chest wall invasion: myasthenic pain, palpable mass
• Myasthenic symptoms: easy fatigability, drooping eyelid, double vision, dysarthria
• Constitutional symptoms of malignancy: weight loss, night sweats, fever.
Physical examination
The mediastinum is inaccessible to direct physical examination except during surgery. Specific physical
findings are related to compression or invasion of adjacent structures, or paraneoplastic syndromes:
• Airway compression: stridor, prolonged inspiration/expiration, hemoptysis
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve compression: hoarseness
• Superior vena cava obstruction: facial swelling, collateral veins, plethora
• Sympathetic ganglion involvement: Horner syndrome, with miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis
• Myasthenic symptoms: ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, proximal muscle weakness
• Evidence of hematologic malignancy: fever, pallor, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal mass.
Laboratory tests
Laboratory testing is indicated depending on the suspected etiology:
• Thymoma: CBC and acetylcholine receptor antibodies
• Mediastinal goiter: thyroid function tests

DIAGNOSIS
• Parathyroid adenoma: serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone
• Germ cell tumor: alpha-fetoprotein, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
• Pheochromocytoma: plasma free metanephrines, or 24-hour urine fractionated metanephrines and
normetanephrines
• Neurogenic tumor: 24-hour urinary homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid
• Hematologic malignancy: lactate dehydrogenase, CBC and blood smear, flow cytometry, HIV serology,
hepatitis B and C serology.
Imaging studies
Imaging to evaluate mediastinal mass typically employs a stepwise approach beginning with chest
radiography.
Chest x-ray
Posteroanterior and lateral views are usually indicated.[49] Provides information on the size, anatomic
location, density, and composition of the mass.
Computed tomography (CT)
CT with intravenous contrast enhancement provides information concerning the vascularization of the mass
and its relationship to adjacent structures.[49] It can determine the content (calcium, fat, or necrotic tissue)
and characteristics (cystic or solid) of the mass. CT scan is an essential test and is indicated in virtually all
cases to evaluate a mediastinal mass.

Necrotic mediastinal lymphadenopathy

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Provides useful information in evaluating spinal, vascular, or cardiac invasion.[49] MRI facilitates an
assessment of the relationship of the mass to vascular structures, and provides the highest level of
information regarding cystic versus solid components of thymic lesions (which can be important to
differentiate thymomas from benign hyperplasia or thymic cysts).[50]
In the evaluation of the paravertebral (posterior) compartment of the mediastinum, MRI is more sensitive
than CT for determining involvement of the neural foramen or spinal canal invasion. MRI is also useful for
evaluating thyroid masses when iodinated contrast is contraindicated.
Barium swallow
Assesses the relationship of an esophageal cyst to the esophagus proper, and determines whether there is a
communication with the esophageal lumen, which is the case in approximately 10% to 20% of patients.[51]
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
May be used to differentiate between an intramural or extramural mass and delineate the relation of an
esophageal or bronchogenic cyst to surrounding structures.

DIAGNOSIS
Has a high sensitivity and is able to detect intratesticular lesions as small as 2 mm; indicated if germ cell
tumor is suspected.
Radionuclide studies
Nuclear scans and biochemical studies are useful in diagnosing and evaluating the following conditions.
Suspected substernal thyroid
Radioactive iodine thyroid scan to define the nature and extent of thyroid gland; toxic multinodular goiter
shows multiple hot and cold areas consistent with areas of autonomy and suppression; malignant thyroid
nodules are generally cold.
Suspected catecholamine-secreting tumor
Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan to define the nature and extent of tumor.
Malignancy
Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET scan to define the extent and stage of a malignancy. 18F-
FDG uptake occurs in most malignancies including lymphomas, metastatic carcinomas, and lung cancers.
18F-FDG PET-CT is effective in detecting lymph node metastases and extrathoracic metastases in patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It confers significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than
contrast-enhanced CT and higher sensitivity than 18F-FDG PET in staging NSCLC.[52] [53]
Neuroendocrine tumor
Gallium 68 or GaTate PET-CT scans are especially suited for diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, such as
thymic carcinoid. They increase the sensitivity with which metastatic disease can be identified.[54]
Biopsy techniques
While clinical assessment in combination with radiographic imaging can often narrow the diagnostic
possibilities, definitive pathologic diagnosis is often required prior to initiating therapy. There are many
modalities to obtain a pathologic diagnosis, and each modality has its advantages and limitations.
Image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy
Performed with either CT or ultrasound using local anesthesia and light sedation. Samples are taken using
either a fine needle or a core needle. It is mainly indicated for prevascular (anterior) mediastinal masses.
Image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy is minimally invasive, associated with low risk, and can be
done as an outpatient procedure.[55] Tissue may, however, be insufficient to render a definitive diagnosis,
especially with lymphoma and thymoma.
Endoscopic biopsy with or without ultrasonography
Can be performed bronchoscopically (combined endobronchial ultrasound, EBUS) or through the esophagus
(EUS) using a fine needle.[56] The accessible areas are those immediately adjacent to the tracheobronchial
tree and esophagus, which limits what can be biopsied. The American Thoracic Society has standardized the
nomenclature of lymph nodes in the chest. There are 14 numbered nodal stations; lymph nodes considered

to be in the mediastinum are stations 1 to 9. EBUS can access mediastinal nodal stations 2, 4, and 7, while
EUS can access nodal stations 5, 7, 8, and 9.
EBUS is minimally invasive, associated with low risk, and can be done as an outpatient procedure.[57] Use
of EBUS may reduce the need for surgical staging via mediastinoscopy.[58] However, only limited areas are
amenable to biopsy with EBUS.
Mediastinoscopy
A surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia. Incision is made just above the manubrium, and a
mediastinoscope is passed along the pretracheal plane into the mediastinum. The high (station 2) and low
(station 4) paratracheal lymph nodes, as well as the subcarinal lymph nodes (station 7) can be sampled.
It is generally used for diagnosis and staging of lung cancer or lymphoma. Mediastinoscopy has the same
accuracy as combined EBUS and EUS, with greater accuracy when all tests are taken together.[58] However,
mediastinoscopy is an invasive procedure, and endobronchial ultrasound is increasingly used instead. The
risk of major complications, such as great vessel injury, is low.
Mediastinotomy/Chamberlain procedure
Typically used for masses of the anterior mediastinum or within the aortopulmonary window. A small
transverse parasternal incision allows excellent exposure and has a high diagnostic yield. It is an invasive
procedure requiring general anesthesia and may require tube thoracostomy if the pleural space is violated.
Thoracoscopy
Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), a minimally invasive surgical technique, is a valuable tool
in the diagnosis and management of mediastinal masses. Almost all traditionally open procedures can
be performed via VATS, including thymectomy, duplication cyst excision, pericardial cyst excision, and
paravertebral (posterior) mediastinal mass resection. It allows excellent exposure of all compartments of the
mediastinum for diagnostic biopsy or therapeutic excision. VATS also permits the accurate determination of
local invasion or intrapleural metastatic spread. VATS typically requires general anesthesia, but awake VATS
has been reported and is used in some centers, particularly in Europe and Asia.[59] VATS procedures may
be performed with robotic assistance, with excellent outcomes.[60]
Sternotomy or thoracotomy
Sternotomy gives excellent exposure to the prevascular (anterior) mediastinum, and thoracotomy gives
excellent exposure to the visceral (middle) and paravertebral (posterior) mediastinum. Sternotomy or
thoracotomy is useful when excision of large lesions (>5 to 7 cm) is required, or if there is invasion into
adjacent structures requiring complex resection and reconstruction (such as the SVC, diaphragm, or
pericardium).
Bone marrow biopsy
Indicated if clinical features are suggestive of an underlying hematologic malignancy such as lymphoma or
acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Peripheral lymph node biopsy
Hematologic and metastatic malignancies may have abnormal lymph nodes peripherally. Excision of
a complete lymph node provides valuable information on the malignant cell type based on histologic

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
