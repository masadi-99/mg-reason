Ventricular septal defects Overview
Summary
Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are defects in the interventricular septum that allow shunting of blood
between the left and right ventricles.
Usually congenital, but rarely acquired after myocardial infarction or trauma.
May be associated with other congenital defects such as tetralogy of Fallot.
Significant left-to-right shunting results in pulmonary hypertension, which, if left untreated, can progress to
shunt reversal with cyanosis and Eisenmenger syndrome.
Small shunts may close spontaneously in childhood and can be managed by observation.
Large shunts require surgical closure.
Definition
VSDs are congenital or acquired defects in the interventricular septum that allow shunting of blood between
the left and right ventricles.
Eisenmenger syndrome is shunt reversal (blood flowing from the right to the left ventricle) leading to the
distribution of deoxygenated blood to the systemic arterial circulation.

THEORY
Epidemiology
Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are among the most common congenital heart defects in infants and
children, and an isolated VSD is seen in approximately 3 infants per 1000 live births.[7] Most of these close
spontaneously in childhood.[8] [9] [10] [11] VSD may accompany other congenital defects.
Type 4 (muscular) defects are the most common VSDs, along with type 2 (perimembranous).[12] [13]
Down syndrome is commonly associated with atrioventricular septal defects, which are seen in between one
third and one half of all patients.[14] [15] These may be atrial septal, ventricular septal, or both.[16] Overall,
atrioventricular septal defects are thought to be present in about 0.29 to 0.54 per 1000 live births.[7][13] [17]
Acquired VSDs, due to myocardial infarction or trauma, are rare.
Etiology
Congenital
• Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are usually developmental congenital conditions. No definite cause
is known. In families with a strong history of congenital cardiovascular malformations, the incidence of
VSD is increased. Certain genetic abnormalities have a high incidence of associated VSD, the most
common being Down syndrome, which is associated with congenital cardiovascular malformations in
one third to one half of cases.[14] [15]
Acquired
• In rare cases, a VSD can occur as a result of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This usually occurs 2 to
5 days after the infarction and is marked by the onset of acute left-heart failure, chest pain, low cardiac
output and shock.[6] VSD also occurs as a result of penetrating or, rarely, blunt trauma.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiologies of all VSDs are essentially the same, regardless of location. Two factors determine
the hemodynamic effects of a VSD: the size of the defect and the pulmonary vascular resistance. If the
defect is able to limit the transmission of pressure from the left to the right side of the heart, it is called a
restrictive defect.
A small restrictive defect (pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio [Qp:Qs] <1.5:1) leads to minimal left-to-right
shunting across the ventricles, and is not associated with any increase in pulmonary vascular resistance or
with any symptoms. If found in infancy there is a high likelihood of spontaneous closure; however, it has a
good prognosis, even if it persists into adulthood.
A moderate restrictive defect (Qp:Qs 1.5:1 to 2.5:1) will lead to left-to-right shunting and a variable amount
of pulmonary hypertension. Initially, there is reactive pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary hypertension
that is reversible with pulmonary vasodilators) with left-to-right shunting. Gradually, the pulmonary
vascular resistance rises, resulting in decreased shunting. Persistent pulmonary hypertension eventually
becomes "fixed" pulmonary hypertension, produced by permanent irreversible remodeling of the pulmonary
vasculature. Pulmonary hypertension increases the back pressure on the heart, causing dilatation of the
cardiac chambers and, eventually, heart failure.

Ventricular septal defects Theory
In larger defects (Qp:Qs >2.5:1) and in late stages, significant pulmonary hypertension occurs and
pulmonary vascular resistance rises to the point that the shunt reverses (Eisenmenger syndrome). Shunt
reversal alludes to blood flowing from the right to the left ventricle, effectively "reversing" the flow seen
through most VSDs. It results in unoxygenated blood from the systemic venous return passing directly into
the systemic arterial circulation without going through the lungs to be oxygenated. Oxygen saturation in the
systemic arterial circulation therefore falls, resulting in cyanosis. The VSD becomes inoperable at this point.
In infancy, the mechanism of pulmonary hypertension is different from in adults, and is primarily due
to increased pulmonary blood flow rather than increased pulmonary vascular resistance. However, the
sequelae are the same. Reduced systemic perfusion is still seen in infants, resulting in heart failure.
An acute VSD resulting from an acute MI will usually result in acute left-heart failure with pulmonary edema
and shock.[6]
Additional problems can arise with certain types of VSD. With type 1 defects, accompanying aortic
regurgitation is common, produced by prolapse of the anterior aortic valve leaflet. With type 3 defects, there
is often involvement of the atrioventricular valves and the atrial septum.
Classification
Classification according to location[1]
VSDs are classified according to their location. There are 4 main types, 3 of which are known by several
synonyms.
Type 1
• 6% of isolated VSDs in non-Asian populations, but up to 33% in Asian populations
• Synonyms: conal defect, conal septal hypoplasia, sub-pulmonary defect, infundibular defect,
supracristal defect, doubly committed juxta-arterial defect
• Location: lies beneath the semilunar valves in the conal or outlet septum
• Often associated with aortic regurgitation produced by prolapse of the anterior aortic valve leaflet
Type 2
• Synonyms: perimembranous defect, paramembranous defect, conoventricular defect
• Location: confluent with the membranous septum, bordered by an atrioventricular (AV) valve
Type 3
• Synonyms: peri-inlet defect, AV canal type defect, AV septal defect, endocardial cushion defect
• Location: involves the inlet of the ventricular septum immediately inferior to the AV valve apparatus
• Typically occur in patients with Down syndrome
Type 4
• Up to 20% of VSDs in infants. Adult incidence is much lower
• Synonym: muscular defect
• Location: completely surrounded by muscle; multiple defects may be present, producing a "Swiss
cheese" appearance of the septum
•  Spontaneous closure may occur

Classification by etiology
Congenital
• Most VSDs are the result of a developmental defect
Acquired
• Rare
• Necrosis of the septum following MI can produce a VSD
• Penetrating trauma (e.g., a stab wound) or, very rarely, blunt trauma can produce a VSD
Classification by size[2]
VSDs can be divided into small, moderate, and large defects according to size. The magnitude of the shunt
produced by a VSD is described by the Qp:Qs ratio.
The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline includes the following
classification:
• Small restrictive defects. The pulmonary vascular resistance is not significantly elevated and the left-
to-right shunt is small (Qp:Qs <1.5:1).
• Large nonrestrictive defects in cyanotic patients who have developed Eisenmenger syndrome, with
pulmonary vascular resistance at systemic levels and shunt reversal (right-to-left).

International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision (ICD-11)[4]
In ICD-11, VSDs are contained within the “Developmental anomalies” chapter and are defined as a
congenital cardiac malformation in which there is a hole or pathway between the ventricular chambers. They
are further subclassified as follows.
Trabecular muscular ventricular septal defect
• A congenital cardiac malformation in which there is a ventricular septal defect within the trabeculated
component of the ventricular septum.
Perimembranous central ventricular septal defect
• A congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is a ventricular septal defect that:
• occupies the space that is usually closed by the interventricular part of the membranous septum
• is usually adjacent to the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of an atrioventricular
valve and an arterial valve
• is adjacent to an area of mitral-tricuspid fibrous continuity
• is located at the center of the base of the ventricular mass.
Ventricular septal defect hemodynamically insignificant
• A congenital cardiac malformation in which there is one or more small, clinically insignificant
ventricular septal defect(s) in the absence of flow-related cardiac chamber dilation or abnormal
elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure.
Case history
Case history #1
An infant is noted at birth to have a cardiac murmur. Physical exam reveals a systolic murmur at the left
sternal border. There is no clinical evidence of heart failure.
Case history #2
An infant presents with symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion, and faltering growth. Physical exam
reveals a systolic murmur at the left sternal border and signs of congestive heart failure.
Other presentations
Eisenmenger syndrome presents with central cyanosis, with or without finger clubbing, and patients
may have evidence of heart failure and a history of recurrent pulmonary infections. Erythrocytosis
develops secondary to cyanosis, subsequently leading to iron deficiency and blood hyperviscosity. Key
symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome include headache, fatigue, dizziness, hemoptysis, atypical chest
pain, palpitations, and dyspnea (may be on exertion only).[5] Usually, the patient will have a documented
history of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) that was not corrected.

A VSD secondary to myocardial infarction (MI) presents 3 to 5 days after the initial MI with symptoms of
heart failure or, in severe cases, cardiogenic shock.[6] Traumatic VSDs can present at a variety of time
frames from immediate to delayed. The presence and severity of symptoms depend on the size of the
VSD.[1]

DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Most patients with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) will present in infancy and childhood following the
detection of a murmur on routine examination. It is unusual for a VSD to present in adults. Most small
defects spontaneously close by age 1 to 2 years; most moderate defects have already been diagnosed and
treated before adulthood and most large untreated defects result in increased mortality in childhood, and are
therefore no longer seen in adults.[11]
If a VSD does present in adulthood, the context is usually one of the following:[2] [11]
• Restrictive defects that failed to close in childhood but are not hemodynamically important; these pose
a risk of endocarditis
• Moderate-sized defects not yet closed; these patients typically have mild pulmonary hypertension
• Large defects that lead to Eisenmenger syndrome (right-to-left shunt) and are inoperable
• Patients who have had their defects closed in childhood but are under follow-up, some of whom may
have or develop residual shunting from patch leaks.
The diagnosis is usually suspected by the detection of a murmur on physical exam and confirmed by
echocardiography.[2] [11] Chest x-ray and ECG provide supportive evidence of chamber enlargement but
are not diagnostic. If the images obtained by echocardiography are inconclusive, or further assessment of
complex associated abnormalities is required, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography
(CT) can be used.[21] Cardiac catheterization is used to confirm the estimation of the shunt in cases where
the shunt estimation obtained by echocardiography was inadequate or did not concur with the clinical
presentation.[1]

History
There is often a history of a systolic murmur, usually present since birth. The patient may have no
symptoms or, in cases of a moderate-sized defect, may develop shortness of breath with exertion as a
result of heart failure or faltering growth. If a large, unoperated defect is present, shunt reversal should be
suspected if there is a history of recurrent pulmonary infection and signs of cyanotic heart disease.
A VSD secondary to myocardial infarction (MI) presents 3 to 5 days after the initial MI with symptoms of
heart failure or, in severe cases, cardiogenic shock.[6] Traumatic VSDs can present at a variety of time
frames from immediate to delayed; the presence and severity of symptoms depend on the size of the
VSD.[1]
Physical exam
A holosystolic murmur can be heard at the lower left parasternal border. This may be accompanied by
a palpable thrill. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound may be loud due to pulmonary
hypertension. There may be signs of cardiomegaly, including displacement of the apical impulse
downward and laterally on the precordium and, in case of right ventricular hypertrophy, a parasternal
heave. Tachypnea may be present in infants who develop heart failure.
Shunt reversal should be suspected if there is evidence of cyanosis, which is sometimes accompanied by
clubbing of the nails.
Initial investigations
Echocardiogram
• Echocardiography is the investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the shunt
as well as associated abnormalities.[2] [11] The defect can be seen on 2D images, and the shunt
visualized on color flow imaging. When directed at the defect in the parasternal views, spectral
Doppler will show a high-velocity systolic jet based on the gradient between the left ventricle and
right ventricle above the baseline in systole. Additionally, chamber sizes can be assessed, and the
tricuspid regurgitation jet can be used to determine the pulmonary arterial systolic pressure. In case
of a type 1 defect, associated aortic regurgitation can be evaluated. Associated conditions such as
tetralogy of Fallot can also be diagnosed.

• The magnitude of the shunt produced by a VSD is described by the pulmonary-systemic blood flow
ratio (Qp:Qs); this measurement is obtained by Doppler echocardiography.
• Echocardiography should be ordered in every patient suspected of having a VSD (regardless of
whether it is isolated or occurs in the context of a more complex condition) as it helps to establish

or confirm the diagnosis, and guides appropriate management. A comprehensive transthoracic
echocardiogram is recommended and can also evaluate pulmonary hypertension and any
concomitant heart defects.[22] [23] [24]
Chest x-ray
• The chest x-ray may show a normal-sized cardiac silhouette, or show enlargement of the heart. If
the shunting is significant, it may be accompanied by prominence of pulmonary vascular markings
and pulmonary congestion.
ECG
• The ECG may be normal, or may show evidence of left atrial enlargement and left ventricular
hypertrophy, or may show biventricular hypertrophy. The ECG is not diagnostic of a VSD, but
provides supportive evidence of chamber enlargement (if present).
Subsequent investigations
Cardiac MRI
• Although not commonly used in clinical practice for this purpose, MRI is an excellent modality to
assess a VSD and also to quantify the shunt. It is reserved for cases with complex defects in need
of further assessment, or where echocardiography is inconclusive.
Cardiac CT scanning
• Cardiac CT is not a first-line diagnostic test, but can be useful in patients in whom MRI is
contraindicated or if MRI shows artifacts from pacemaker leads, for example. It also has the
advantage of allowing assessment of coronary arteries.
Right-heart cardiac catheterization
• This is usually not needed, and is reserved for cases in which confirmation of shunt estimation
is required, usually due to a discrepancy between the clinical presentation and the assessment
of the VSD provided by imaging, or because imaging was inadequate in patients with difficult
echocardiographic windows.[2]
• An oximetric run on cardiac catheterization (continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation as the
catheter is moved) will demonstrate a "step-up" in oxygen saturations in the right ventricle (i.e., the
right ventricular saturation will be significantly higher than the right atrial saturation due to mixing of
oxygenated blood from the left ventricle).
• Contrast angiography of the left ventricle will demonstrate the location of the VSD and the site of
shunting with contrast going into the right ventricle from the left ventricle. It may also demonstrate
the presence of an aneurysm of the ventricular septum.
• Pulmonary arterial pressures can be measured to provide an index of pulmonary vascular
resistance. This information is useful to assess suitability for surgical correction.
• If significant pulmonary hypertension is present, responsiveness to vasodilators (oxygen or nitric
oxide) can be used to distinguish reactive from "fixed" pulmonary hypertension; patients whose
pulmonary hypertension is reactive may benefit more from surgery.

History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
systolic murmur left parasternal region (common)
• This murmur is generally holosystolic and does not increase with inspiration (unlike tricuspid
regurgitation).
• The murmur is generally easily heard; a smaller defect generally results in a louder murmur.

Ventricular septal defects Diagnosis
faltering growth (common)
• Congenital heart disease should always be excluded in infants and children with unexplained faltering
growth.
shortness of breath (common)
• Shortness of breath on exertion tends to occur in patients with a long-standing moderate-sized shunt.
Infants may also have tachypnea and shortness of breath with feeding and effort.
Other diagnostic factors
recurrent pulmonary infections (common)
• May be attributable to shunt reversal in patients with large unoperated defects, especially when
accompanied by physical signs of finger clubbing and/or cyanosis.
loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound (common)
• A sign of pulmonary hypertension, which typically develops in cases of significant left-to-right shunt.
cyanosis (uncommon)
• Occurs in cases of shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome).[5]
• The cause is a large uncorrected ventricular septal defect (VSD) shunt that produces severe
pulmonary hypertension, increasing the right-heart pressure to the point that unoxygenated blood is
forced straight into the left heart and systemic circulation.
• Decreased blood flow in the pulmonary circulation contributes further to the cyanosis.
finger clubbing (uncommon)
• Finger clubbing is associated with a range of cyanotic congenital heart diseases, including ventricular
septal defects (VSDs).
recent myocardial infarction (usually within 3 to 5 days) (uncommon)
• A recent history of myocardial infarction may indicate an acquired ventricular septal defect (VSD).[6]
recent trauma (uncommon)
• Rarely, a ventricular septal defect (VSD) can be caused by trauma.[1]
Risk factors
Strong
family history of congenital heart disease
• Congenital heart defects, including ventricular septal defects, are more likely in patients with a positive
family history of such defects.[18]
Down syndrome (trisomy 21)
• Between one third and one half of people with Down syndrome have congenital heart disease, most
commonly atrioventricular septal defects or ventricular septal defects.[14] [15]

concomitant heart defects.[22] [23] [24] 2D imaging and color flow
Doppler are usually diagnostic: the defect is clearly visualized on 2D
views, and spectral-wave Doppler serves to confirm a high-velocity jet
across the VSD demonstrating the left-to-right shunt. 
• The degree of shunting can be estimated by Doppler, and a
pulmonary-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp:Qs) can be determined.
• Also diagnoses associated conditions (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot) and
complications (chamber enlargement, aortic regurgitation).
• Continuous-wave Doppler of the tricuspid regurgitation jet can be
used to assess the degree of pulmonary hypertension.

Atrial septal defect • The murmur is usually higher
up in the left parasternal
region and results from
flow across the pulmonic
valve. Therefore, the murmur
is much softer, mid or
ejection systolic instead of
holosystolic, and the second
heart sound may have a
wide and fixed (not changing
with breathing) split.
• An echocardiogram will
demonstrate the defect and
site of shunting by color flow.
Patent ductus arteriosus • Associated with a continuous
systolic and diastolic murmur
at the base of the heart.
• An echocardiogram will
show the defect at the level
of the ductus arteriosus.
Mitral regurgitation • Mitral regurgitation results
in a holosystolic murmur
most prominent at the mitral
area, and may radiate to
the axilla or the lower left
sternal border depending on
the eccentricity of the mitral
regurgitation jet.
• An echocardiogram will
reveal posterior motion of
valve leaflets during mid-
systole without evidence of a
ventricular septal defects.
Tricuspid regurgitation • Tricuspid regurgitation
results in a holosystolic
murmur at the lower left
parasternal region. A
characteristic finding in
tricuspid regurgitation
shared with other right-sided
murmurs is an increase in
the murmur intensity with
inspiration (Carvalho sign).
• An echocardiogram will
demonstrate regurgitant
flow across the tricuspid
valve without evidence of a

Pulmonic stenosis • Ejection systolic murmur at
the left upper parasternal
border.
• An echocardiogram will
demonstrate turbulence of
color flow and a gradient

without evidence of a
ventricular septal defect.
Tetralogy of Fallot • Typical infant presents in
the newborn period with

Screening
Routine physical exam at birth and other times will generally detect the murmur of ventricular septal defect
leading to the diagnosis. All newborns should be screened for congenital heart defects, ideally using pulse
oximetry. An echocardiogram is necessary only if the child has a murmur, or has unexplained faltering
growth or heart failure signs. In the US and certain other countries, a failed pulse oximetry screen mandates
echocardiographic evaluation for critical congenital heart disease.[25]

Ventricular septal defects Management
Approach
Initially, the diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) should be confirmed by echocardiography and
an assessment made of the degree of shunting and the presence and degree of any associated pulmonary
hypertension. The magnitude of the shunt produced by a VSD is described by the pulmonary-systemic blood
flow ratio (Qp:Qs).
In patients with small defects, observation is all that is required. In patients with significant shunts with Qp:Qs
≥1.5:1 (moderate and large defects), surgical closure of the VSD is generally recommended. If the patient
presents with symptoms of heart failure, the heart failure must be treated prior to surgical closure. In cases
of severe pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome, closure of the VSD is contraindicated.
Pulmonary vasodilators may be used to provide supportive treatment.[5] For advanced disease with
Eisenmenger syndrome, heart-lung transplantation could be considered.[2] [5] [24]
Children with congenital heart defects such as VSD should ideally begin transitioning to adult cardiology
during early adolescence. It may be appropriate for the transition to continue into emerging adulthood
(ages 18 to 25 years) for some patients. The American Heart Association guidelines recommend designing
a transition program that is sympathetic to neurocognitive diversity and that emphasizes patient self-
management.[26] [27]
Patients with small congenital defects
Patients with small defects (Qp:Qs <1.5:1) can be managed with observation. In infants, most small
defects close spontaneously, and most of those that persist are of no hemodynamic importance.[2]
Asymptomatic patients with moderate or large congenital defects
Medium or large VSDs should be closed to prevent progression to severe pulmonary hypertension, heart
failure, and Eisenmenger syndrome.[2] Surgical closure is recommended in adults with evidence of
left ventricular volume overload and hemodynamically significant shunts (Qp:Qs ≥1.5:1) if: pulmonary
artery (PA) systolic pressure is <50% systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance is less than one third
systemic. Surgical closure may be considered: when a perimembranous or supracristal VSD causes
worsening aortic regurgitation; with a history of infective endocarditis; or when PA systolic pressure
is ≥50% systemic and/or pulmonary vascular resistance is greater than one third systemic with a left-
to-right shunt (Qp:Qs ≥1.5:1).[2] [11] The usual procedure is open surgery in which a patch (bovine
pericardium or synthetic material) is used to close the VSD.[2] One study found that surgical repair
and transcatheter device closure of perimembranous VSDs in children were equally effective, with
transcatheter closure being associated with shorter hospital stay, less blood transfused, and lower
cost.[28] Percutaneous device closure of a VSD is an alternative option, in which an occluder device
is placed through percutaneous access to close the VSD. The percutaneous approach may be used in
patients who have type 2 or type 4 defects that are not in close proximity to the valves. It has also been
utilized in cases with too high a risk for surgical closure due to serious comorbidities.[29] [30] [31] [32]
Symptomatic patients with moderate or large congenital defects
Patients who present with symptoms of congestive heart failure may be treated medically prior to surgical
correction. Although small defects often close spontaneously in children, children with large defects may
present with faltering growth and require surgical closure. Preoperative medical therapy may be used in
infants to delay closure until the infant has grown enough and surgery can be performed; these medical
therapies are almost never required in adults. Furosemide is the first-line treatment. ACE inhibitors and

digoxin can be added depending on the clinical response.[2] [33] Once the heart failure is adequately
treated, open surgery or percutaneous device closure can be used to close the VSD.[2] Surgical closure
is recommended in adults with evidence of left ventricular volume overload and hemodynamically
significant shunts (Qp:Qs ≥1.5:1) if: PA systolic pressure is <50% systemic and pulmonary vascular
resistance is less than one third systemic. Surgical closure may be considered: when a perimembranous
or supracristal VSD causes worsening aortic regurgitation; with a history of infective endocarditis; or when
PA systolic pressure is ≥50% systemic and/or pulmonary vascular resistance is greater than one third
systemic with a left-to-right shunt (Qp:Qs ≥1.5:1).[2] [11] Anemia, if present, should be corrected by red
blood cell transfusion, or by iron therapy in case of iron-deficiency anemia.
If patients progress to shunt reversal with Eisenmenger syndrome, the VSD is inoperable and
treatment is supportive with pharmacotherapy.[5] Drugs used to treat pulmonary hypertension include
phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil), endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g.,
bosentan, ambrisentan), and prostacyclins (e.g., epoprostenol).[24] Sildenafil and tadalafil have been
shown to improve exercise capacity and hemodynamics in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.[24] [34]
 However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend the use of these agents
for this indication in pediatric patients due to an increased risk of mortality with higher doses in one trial,
unless the medical team consider that the benefits of treatment with the drug are likely to outweigh its
potential risks.[35]  [Revatio (sildenafil): drug safety communication - FDA clarifies warning about pediatric
use for pulmonary arterial hypertension] (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm390876.htm) 
 Bosentan and ambrisentan have also been shown to improve hemodynamics in Eisenmenger syndrome,
but larger studies are needed.[24][36] Epoprostenol may be an alternative option to these agents.[37][38]
[39] Monotherapy or combination therapy with these agents may be recommended, and the choice of
regimen should be decided in consult with a specialist.
In very severe cases, heart-lung transplantation can be considered.[5] [24]
Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome frequently develop erythrocytosis to compensate for the hypoxemia,
and some of them develop hyperviscosity.[5] Hyperviscosity manifests with headache, fatigue, dyspnea
and dizziness.[5] Phlebotomy and intravenous infusion of saline may be performed in select patients if
symptoms of hyperviscosity are severe.[5] Routine phlebotomy for asymptomatic erythrocytosis is not
indicated. Anemia and volume depletion can cause similar symptoms and should be excluded before
starting this type of therapy.[5]
Patients with acquired VSD due to myocardial infarction
Surgery is required in all patients, as mortality without surgery is extremely high.[6] Mortality is much
lower with urgent surgery. Generally, patients undergo coronary angiography and intra-aortic balloon
pump insertion prior to open surgery, in order to define coronary anatomy for possible coronary artery
bypass grafting and to stabilize the patient with the intra-aortic balloon pump.[6] Concomitant coronary
revascularization appears to improve outcomes.[40] Percutaneous device closure is an option if the risks
of open surgical closure are too high.[41] [42]
Patients with acquired VSD due to trauma
VSD has been reported both after penetrating trauma such as stab wounds and, very rarely, after blunt
trauma such as motor vehicle accident injuries. A traumatic VSD can manifest clinically over a range of
time courses from immediate to delayed. A traumatic VSD is generally treated with surgical repair of the
defect in patients with significant-sized defects. Small defects with insignificant shunts may be managed
conservatively.

Prophylactic antibiotics
Due to the high flow velocity across the VSD, there is an increased risk of infective endocarditis in patients
with VSDs compared with the general population. Even small defects that are not hemodynamically
significant may cause endocarditis.[43]
A high index of suspicion should be maintained in these patients; infective endocarditis often presents
nonspecifically and most commonly involves fever with possible physical signs of peripheral emboli: Osler
nodes, Roth spots, or Janeway lesions.
Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended in all patients with VSD, but is reserved for especially
high-risk groups: patients with Eisenmenger syndrome; patients with a previous history of infective
endocarditis; patients within 6 months following patch repair or percutaneous device closure of VSD;
or patients with a residual defect following closure. Prophylaxis is no longer recommended for routine
gastrointestinal procedures.[2] The development of endocarditis as a complication is an indication for
corrective closure of the VSD regardless of its size.

defect is inoperable and treatment is supportive
with pharmacotherapy.[5]
» Drugs used to treat pulmonary hypertension
include phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors
(e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil), endothelin receptor
antagonists (e.g., bosentan, ambrisentan), and
prostacyclins (e.g., epoprostenol).[24]
» Sildenafil and tadalafil have been shown to
improve exercise capacity and hemodynamics
in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.[24] [34]
However, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) does not recommend the use of these
agents for this indication in pediatric patients
due to an increased risk of mortality with higher
doses in one trial, unless the medical team
consider that the benefits of treatment with the
drug are likely to outweigh its potential risks.[35] 
[Revatio (sildenafil): drug safety communication

» Bosentan and ambrisentan have also
been shown to improve hemodynamics in
Eisenmenger syndrome, but larger studies are
needed.[24] [36]
» Epoprostenol may be an alternative option to
these agents.[37] [38] [39]
» Monotherapy or combination therapy with

Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome
frequently develop erythrocytosis to compensate
for the hypoxemia, and some of them develop
hyperviscosity.[5] Hyperviscosity manifests with
headache, fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness.
Phlebotomy and intravenous infusion of saline
may be performed in select patients if symptoms
of hyperviscosity are severe.[5] Routine
phlebotomy for asymptomatic erythrocytosis is
not indicated. Anemia and volume depletion can
cause similar symptoms and should be excluded
before starting this type of therapy.[5]
2nd heart-lung transplantation
» In some patients who are severely
symptomatic, heart-lung transplant may
be considered and, when feasible, surgical
correction of the ventricular septal defect
together with lung transplant may be
considered.[5] [24] The survival of patients with
Eisenmenger syndrome who receive a heart-
lung transplant is similar to that of other heart-
lung transplant recipients, or better, despite a
more difficult operative course.[24] [44]

Acute
» Patients generally present with acute left-
heart failure, and mortality without surgery is
extremely high.[6] Mortality is much lower with
urgent surgery.
» Generally, patients undergo coronary
angiography and intra-aortic balloon pump
insertion prior to surgery in order to define
coronary anatomy for possible coronary
artery bypass graft (CABG) and to stabilize
the patient with the intra-aortic balloon
pump. CABG is carried out at the same time
as the corrective closure.[6] Concomitant
coronary revascularization appears to improve
outcomes.[40]
» Percutaneous device closure is an option if
the risks of open surgical closure are too high.

Primary prevention
Avoidance of alcohol and smoking during pregnancy is recommended. Maternal alcohol consumption and
cigarette smoking are both associated with increased incidence of ventricular septal defects.[19] [20]

Ventricular septal defects Management
Secondary prevention
In case of a febrile illness, endocarditis should be suspected and blood cultures obtained before initiating
antibiotic therapy. Depending on the degree of suspicion, transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography
should be performed.[49] Prophylaxis is only indicated in patients at particularly high risk of developing
endocarditis: patients with Eisenmenger syndrome; patients with a previous history of infective endocarditis;
patients within 6 months following patch repair or percutaneous device closure of ventricular septal defect
(VSD); or patients with a residual defect following closure. Prophylaxis is not recommended for routine
gastrointestinal procedures.[2]
Patient discussions
It is important for patients to keep follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms immediately,
especially shortness of breath on exertion. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention in
case of fever or tiredness, especially following dental work.
Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), even with the lower-complexity type, are at increased risk
of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as they age, and show increased morbidity and
mortality following cardiovascular events.[48] Patients should be educated about this risk and lifestyle
elements such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, and arterial hypertension, and monitored for
the development of such modifiable risk factors.

Monitoring
Monitoring
Asymptomatic individuals should undergo annual clinical follow-up. Issues to be monitored include
development of aortic regurgitation, development of tricuspid regurgitation, assessment of left-to-
right shunt, ventricular dysfunction, and assessment of pulmonary pressure. Routine surveillance via
transthoracic echocardiogram at 3 to 5 yearly intervals is considered appropriate for asymptomatic
individuals with small muscular ventricular septal defects (VSDs) or 1 to 2 yearly intervals in asymptomatic
children with VSDs in other locations besides muscular septum.[23]
In patients who have undergone repair or closure of a VSD, the degree of residual shunting and
development of heart blocks or arrhythmias are additional issues that need to be monitored.

Ventricular septal defects Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
aortic regurgitation in type 1 defects long term high
Flow of blood through a restriction causes a reduction in fluid pressure (the Venturi effect). If a Venturi
effect occurs through a left-to-right shunt in proximity to the aortic valve, the valve can prolapse, causing
aortic insufficiency and regurgitation. In such cases, surgical repair of the ventricular septal defect (VSD)
should be considered in order to prevent worsening of the aortic regurgitation.[46]
complication of surgical management: heart block long term low
The surgical procedure may affect the conducting tissue in the heart thereby resulting in heart block. This
may require implantation of a permanent pacemaker.[47]
postoperative dysrhythmias long term low
Cardiac dysrhythmias are a major source of morbidity and mortality for patients. Although rhythm disorders
can often be observed with unrepaired or palliated defects, the most difficult cases usually involve patients
who have undergone prior intracardiac repairs, especially when performed relatively late in life.
Virtually the entire spectrum of rhythm disturbances can manifest in these patients.
infective endocarditis variable low
Due to the high flow velocity across the ventricular septal defect (VSD), there is an increased risk of
infective endocarditis in patients with VSDs compared with the general population. Even small defects that
are not hemodynamically significant may cause endocarditis.[43]
A high index of suspicion should be maintained in these patients; infective endocarditis often presents
nonspecifically and most commonly involves fever with possible physical signs of peripheral emboli (Osler
nodes, Roth spots, or Janeway lesions).
Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended in all patients with VSD, but is reserved for especially
high-risk groups: patients with Eisenmenger syndrome; patients with a previous history of infective
endocarditis; patients within 6 months following patch repair or percutaneous device closure of VSD;
or patients with a residual defect following closure. Prophylaxis is no longer recommended for routine
gastrointestinal procedures.[2]
Three sets of blood cultures should be obtained prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. A transesophageal
echocardiogram should be obtained in all suspected cases of infective endocarditis. Treatment is guided
by presentation, clinical findings, and organism virulence.
Prognosis
Patient outlook depends on the size of the defect.

Ventricular septal defects Follow up
FOLLOW UP
• This type, found in infants, closes spontaneously in about 50% of cases. Others are likely to remain
asymptomatic.
Moderate-sized restrictive defect
• May be asymptomatic on presentation. If left untreated over the long-term, many will develop
pulmonary hypertension and later, symptoms of congestive heart failure. If treated with closure, these
patients overall have an excellent outcome.
Large-sized nonrestrictive defects
• These tend to produce early pulmonary hypertension and early heart failure symptoms requiring early
closure. If not closed, patients may develop severe pulmonary hypertension with reversal of blood
shunting, resulting in cyanosis and Eisenmenger syndrome, which is then inoperable and associated
with a poor prognosis.

advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
