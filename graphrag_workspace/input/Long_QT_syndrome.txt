Long QT syndrome Overview
Summary
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by a prolonged QT interval on ECG, which may be congenital or
acquired.
In congenital LQTS, genetic mutations affect ion channels important in myocardial repolarization.
Acquired LQTS may occur secondary to ingestion of QT interval-prolonging drugs, electrolyte imbalances, or
bradyarrhythmias.
Patients with LQTS are at increased risk of syncope, ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes),
and sudden cardiac death.
Unless there is an identifiable reversible cause, treatment primarily involves lifestyle modification and beta-
blocker therapy with the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in selected cases.
Definition
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a congenital or acquired condition that is characterized by a prolonged
QT interval on the surface ECG and is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death due to
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In congenital LQTS, mutations within 17 identified genes result in a variety of
channelopathies affecting myocardial repolarization, thus prolonging the QT interval.
Published definitions of the normal QT interval vary. A prolonged QT interval is defined as a heart rate-
corrected QT interval (QTc) of >450 ms in males and >460 ms in females.[1] The European Society of
Cardiology suggests using a QTc of ≥480 ms for diagnosing LQTS and using a QTc of 460-479 as a
borderline range where a diagnosis may be considered along with other criteria.[2]

Long QT syndrome Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Historically, only the most severe cases of LQTS were detected and reported, suggesting that the condition
was extremely rare.[9] However, it is currently estimated that at least 1 in 2000 to 1 in 2500 people worldwide
are affected with congenital LQTS, although its observed prevalence has increased as awareness and
screening for the condition has improved.[4] [5] [11] Untreated LQTS has an annual rate of sudden cardiac
death of <0.5% in asymptomatic patients, which rises to approximately 5% in patients who have a history of
syncope.[2] LQTS is thought to be responsible for approximately 3000 sudden deaths in the US annually.[11]
[12] [13] [14] The 10-year mortality rate in untreated, symptomatic index cases is approximately 50%.[5]
The mean age of patients at presentation is 14 years.[2] Few data are available to suggest worldwide racial
or ethnic variation in prevalence, but this has not been widely studied. LQTS is more commonly diagnosed
in women, which may be a spurious observation resulting from the higher upper limit for the corrected QT
interval (QTc) in postpubertal females than in males (460 ms and 450 ms, respectively), although one report
suggests a slightly higher incidence in women on the basis of genetics.[15] About 70% to 85% of patients
with LQTS have an identifiable genetic mutation.[2] [5] The LQT1, LQT2, and LQT3 subtypes of the condition
constitute over 90% of cases for which a gene can be identified, with LQT4 to LQT15 accounting for the
remainder. KCNQ1 mutations, which lead to LQT1, account for up to 35% to 45% of genotyped patients and
are the most commonly identified mutations in these patients, followed by KCNH2 mutations, which lead to
LQT2.[16] Romano-Ward syndrome is the most common form of LQTS and has an autosomal dominant form
of inheritance, as opposed to the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, which is a rare autosomal recessive
form of LQTS.[8]
The overall incidence and prevalence of acquired LQTS is not known and is difficult to estimate. In one
retrospective review of hospital admissions, 0.7% of patients had a corrected QT interval >500 ms.[17] In
another case-control study from a cohort of hospitalized cancer patients, 1.5% had a corrected QT interval
>500 ms.[18]
Etiology
Genetic mutations identified in 17 genes account for congenital LQTS, with those in the following 3 genes
constituting 90% to 95% of cases where a gene can be identified.[3] [5] [8] [16] [19] [20]
• LQT1 arises from loss-of-function mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes a potassium channel
responsible for the slow component of the delayed rectifier current (IKs). A homozygous mutation in
KCNQ1 results in the autosomal recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS).
• LQT2 arises from loss-of-function mutations in the KCNH2 gene, which encodes a potassium channel
responsible for the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (IKr).
• LQT3 arises from gain-of-function mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes a sodium channel.
While the number of genes implicated in causing LQTS has expanded to 17, some have limited or disputed
evidence casting doubt on their association with disease.[7]
Acquired LQTS results from a wide variety of causative factors:
• Some of the drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium and/
or magnesium are quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide,
phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds (Arizona CERT):

treatments are also known to cause QT prolongation, e.g., kinase inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors,
androgen-deprivation therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies.[23] [24]
• Electrolyte imbalances: in particular hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.
• Bradyarrhythmias: any sudden bradycardia or atrioventricular (AV) nodal block may result in QT
prolongation or pause-dependent QT prolongation.
• Central nervous system (CNS) lesions: such as intracranial hemorrhage (especially subarachnoid
hemorrhage) and ischemic strokes.
• Malnutrition: liquid protein diet, starvation.
• Intense exercise training may be a cause of reversible long QT interval in athletes.[25]
Pathophysiology
In congenital LQTS, a number of identified genetic mutations cause the alteration of a specific ion channel
current, leading to the pathophysiologic prolongation of repolarization, which equates to QT interval
prolongation on the ECG.
In LQT1 and LQT2, mutations reduce function of the delayed rectifier potassium currents (IKs and IKr,
respectively), which shuttle potassium ions out of the myocardial cell during repolarization, thus making the
cell more negative and returning it to the baseline state of approximately -90 mV.
• LQT1 results from heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, which encodes
the alpha subunit of the slow-activating potassium channel responsible for the slow component
of IKs. These mutations lead to dysfunctional IKs channels, which in turn lead to dispersion of
repolarization from the epicardial to the endocardial surface, allowing potential development of
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Electrocardiographically, there are characteristic prolonged QT intervals
associated with a broad-based T wave.[16]

• LQT2 results from mutations in the KCNH2 gene, which encodes the alpha (HERG) subunit
of the potassium channel responsible for the rapid component of IKr. These mutations lead to
dysfunctional IKr channels, which in turn lead to slowed repolarization and transmural dispersion of
repolarization. This predisposes to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes.
Electrocardiographically, there are characteristic low-amplitude and notched T waves.[16]

ions to persist long into the plateau phase of the action potential, thereby prolonging repolarization.
Electrocardiographically, there are characteristic long ST segments with a late-appearing T wave
resulting in a long QT interval.[16]
ECG findings in type 3 long QT syndrome
From the collection of Dr James P. Daubert
• A hereditary form of complete AV block resulting from degeneration of the bundle of His and its
branches has been linked to the SCN5A gene (mutations of which are responsible for LQT3), which
encodes for rapidly inactivating sodium channels, resulting in a gain of function of a late sodium
current allowing an inward flow of sodium ions to persist long into the plateau phase of the action
potential, thereby prolonging repolarization.
The many causes of acquired LQTS result in prolongation of the QT interval through a variety of
pathophysiologic mechanisms.[26]
• Hypokalemia causes hyperpolarization of myocardial cell membranes with consequent prolongation of
repolarization, which equates to QT interval prolongation on the ECG.
• Hypomagnesemia, which often coexists with hypokalemia, causes early afterdepolarizations, which in
turn lead to prolonged repolarization of myocardial cells and subsequent QT interval prolongation on
the ECG.
• Hypocalcemia prolongs the plateau phase of the action potential, thereby prolonging repolarization of
myocardial cells, which equates to prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
The likelihood of developing acquired LQTS is influenced by genetic variants that affect the repolarization
reserve of a patient, such as D85N in KCNE1.[5]
Classification
Congenital
The condition is inherited as a monogenic disorder with primarily autosomal dominant inheritance and
variable penetrance. Multiple genetic mutations have been identified as the cause of LQTS.[3] [4] [5] [6]
• LQT1 is due to mutations in the KCNQ1 gene.

THEORY
• LQT2 is due to mutations in the KCNH2 gene.
• LQT3 is due to mutations in the SCN5A gene.
• LQT4 to LQT17 have been described but are responsible for <10% of cases; affected genes include
CALM1/2/3, TRDN, KCNE1/2, KCNJ2, and CACNA1C.
While 17 genes have been implicated in causing LQTS, some have limited or disputed evidence casting
doubt on their association with disease.[7]
Inherited as either an autosomal dominant or a recessive trait, LQTS can be phenotypically classified into
several congenital syndromes.
• Romano-Ward syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It may result from a mutation in
any one of the identified genes and is not associated with deafness.[8]
• Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and results from
a homozygous mutation in KCNQ1. It is clinically characterized by a very severe form of LQTS and
sensorineural deafness,[9] and those affected may experience their first cardiac event during infancy.
This is much rarer than the Romano-Ward (autosomal dominant) pattern.
• Andersen-Tawil syndrome, also known as hypokalemic periodic paralysis or LQT7, is a rare autosomal
dominant condition resulting from a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene.[5] These patients have periodic
paralysis and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and have a variety of dysmorphic features.[10]
• Timothy syndrome (LQTS8), a rare autosomal dominant syndrome associated with syndactyly, cardiac
malformations, autism, and dysmorphic features.[2]
Acquired
Many factors are associated with the development of a prolonged QT interval:
• Drugs
• Electrolyte imbalances
• Bradyarrhythmias
• CNS lesions
• Malnutrition
• Pathologic genetic variants in KCNE1 and KCNE2.[5]

Other presentations
The condition may also be discovered as an incidental ECG finding during the routine investigation of
an unrelated presenting complaint. For example, a patient referred to a cardiologist with a concern of a
heart murmur, determined to be an innocent flow murmur, may have an initial ECG revealing a prolonged
corrected QT interval (QTc) of 0.49 seconds, suggesting the presence of LQTS.

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
The diagnosis of LQTS is not straightforward, as nearly 2.5% of the normal population may have a mildly
prolonged QT interval, and nearly 25% of patients genotypically positive for LQTS may have normal-
appearing QT intervals.[31] The QT interval is affected by heart rate (the slower the heart rate the longer the
QT interval); therefore, rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is used. Patients with LQTS may be risk-stratified for
the probability of a future cardiac event (syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden death) according to genotype,
sex, age, and length of the QTc. It is also important to take into consideration any history of past symptoms
when assessing the patient's risk of a future cardiac event. A careful history can help elucidate the presence
of LQTS and identify its genetic subtype in the congenital form of the condition, or highlight the cause of QT
interval prolongation in acquired LQTS. An ECG should be undertaken in all suspected cases.
The Schwartz criteria, based on ECG findings (length of corrected QT interval [QTc], presence of torsades
de pointes, visible T-wave alternans, presence of notched T waves, low heart rate for age in children), clinical
history (presence of syncope, congenital deafness), and family history (of LQTS or sudden death) can be
used to aid the diagnosis of LQTS.[32] [33]
Presenting features
LQTS commonly presents in young people with cardiac arrest or unexplained syncope and is frequently
misdiagnosed as epilepsy. It should therefore be considered in all such presentations, and a thorough
history, including a review of premonitory symptoms and a corroborative history, is essential as it can help
differentiate between cardiac syncope, epilepsy, and other causes of syncope, some of which may be
benign conditions.
Cardiac syncope is characterized by premonitory symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, and
dyspnea. During the syncopal episode, pallor and cyanosis are common features, and the recovery period
is brief and characterized by flushing.
In a patient with documented LQTS and syncope, it is important to try to identify triggers for syncope, as
this may suggest a certain subtype of the syndrome.
• Patients with LQT1 typically have events (i.e., syncope or sudden death) during heightened
adrenergic tone such as in exercise, particularly swimming.[34]
• Patients with LQT2 commonly have events during arousal or when startled, as by a telephone or
alarm clock.[34]
• Female patients with LQTS are more prone to developing arrhythmic symptoms during the first 9
postpartum months, particularly patients with LQT2.[35]
• Patients with LQT3 commonly have events at rest and during bradycardia.[34]
Both congenital and acquired LQTS may present with palpitations secondary to premature ventricular
complex and tachyarrhythmias including torsades de pointes, although the more common symptom is
syncope (or cardiac arrest).
Acquired LQTS secondary to electrolyte imbalance may present with associated symptoms of
hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and/or hypocalcemia.
• Hypokalemia is normally asymptomatic, but it may cause muscle weakness if severe.

• Hypomagnesemia may present with muscle weakness secondary to associated hypokalemia, as
well as tetany (manifested as carpopedal spasm) and numbness (periorally and in the extremities)
secondary to associated hypocalcemia.
Complete atrioventricular (AV) block may present with palpitations, syncope or presyncope, angina,
and symptoms of reduced cardiac output (cold and clammy extremities, fatigue, listlessness, poor effort
tolerance, dizziness, oliguria).
LQTS may also be discovered as an incidental ECG finding during the routine investigation of an
unrelated presenting complaint such as a cardiac murmur, or during genetic diagnostic testing for another
condition.[36]
Medication history
Drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium and/or magnesium may
precipitate symptoms in patients with congenital LQTS or be the primary cause of acquired LQTS:
• Quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, phenothiazines, tricyclic
antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds (Arizona CERT): drugs that prolong the
QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/login/dlcheck)
• Certain cancer treatments are also known to cause QT prolongation, e.g., kinase inhibitors, growth
factor inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies.[23]
[24]
Medical history
Some medical conditions are known to cause acquired LQTS:
• Any sudden bradycardia or AV nodal block may result in QT prolongation or pause-dependent QT
prolongation.
• Central nervous system lesions, such as intracranial hemorrhage (especially subarachnoid
hemorrhage) and ischemic strokes.
Knowledge of the patient's medical history may also be helpful in identifying possible therapeutic drugs
known to prolong the QT interval that the patient may be taking.
Family history
Review of the family history is extremely important to assist in making the diagnosis when it is in doubt,
understand the penetrance of the condition, and screen, treat, and potentially avert cardiac arrest in family
members.
If possible, the ECGs and medical records of all family members should be reviewed.
On occasion, a family member may have more pathologic findings than the affected proband; more
commonly, the proband is the most severely involved.
Developing a family pedigree may help in discovering other affected but undiagnosed family members.
There may be a family history of complete AV block, which may indicate a diagnosis of acquired LQTS
secondary to this condition.

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Physical exam
Patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome have a very severe form of LQTS associated with
sensorineural deafness.[9]
Patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome have periodic paralysis (transient paralysis involving any part
of the body and lasting seconds to hours, typically resolving spontaneously and sometimes associated
with confusion and altered mental status) and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and have a variety of
dysmorphic features including micrognathia, low-set ears, widely spaced eyes, clinodactyly, syndactyly,
and scoliosis.[10]
Severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness.
Patients with hypocalcemia may have positive Chvostek sign (twitching of facial muscles in response
to tapping the facial nerve in the area of the parotid gland) and Trousseau sign (carpopedal spasm in
response to inflation of a blood pressure (BP) cuff creating pressure in the upper limb greater than systolic
BP).
Signs of reduced cardiac output (cold, clammy, pale, or cyanosed extremities; hypotension; confusion)
may be present in complete AV block.
Schwartz criteria
The Schwartz criteria are diagnostic criteria for LQTS and are distinct from the criteria used to risk-stratify
patients with known LQTS. Points are assigned to ECG, clinical, and familial findings. Patients with 3.5
or more points have a high probability of having LQTS, those with 1.5 to 3 points have an intermediate
probability, and those with 1 or no points have a low probability of having LQTS.[32][33]
ECG findings (in the absence of medications or disorders known to affect these features)
• Corrected QT interval (QTc), defined as QT interval (in seconds) divided by the square root of the
RR interval (in seconds):
• ≥480 ms = 3 points
• 460-479 ms = 2 points
• 450-459 ms (in males) = 1 point.
• QTc 4th minute of recovery from exercise stress test ≥480 ms = 1 point
• Torsades de pointes = 2 points
• Visible T-wave alternans = 1 point
• Notched T wave in 3 leads = 1 point
• Low heart rate for age (resting heart rate below the 2nd percentile for age) = 0.5 points.
Clinical history
• Syncope (cannot receive points for both syncope and torsades de pointes)
• With stress = 2 points
• Without stress = 1 point.
• Congenital deafness = 0.5 points.
Family history (the same family member cannot be counted for LQTS and sudden death)

• Family members with definite LQTS = 1 point
• Unexplained sudden cardiac death under age 30 years among immediate family = 0.5 points.
Resting ECG
A resting ECG is crucial in the diagnosis of LQTS and should be undertaken in all suspected cases in
order to confirm QT interval prolongation, help identify the LQTS subtype, and uncover any causative or
contributory reversible factors. When measuring the QT interval, it may be helpful for the patient to move
rapidly from lying to standing.[2]
In a patient with documented LQTS, it is very important to obtain ECGs from parents, siblings, and
especially any family member with presyncope or syncope.
Careful attention must be given to the QT interval and the corrected QT interval (QTc). ECG findings
associated with a high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias include T-wave alternans and functional 2:1
block.[5]

 Inspection and appreciation of the T wave and whether it is monophasic or multiphasic may also be
helpful.
• The QT interval is the ECG representation of ventricular depolarization and subsequent
repolarization and may be measured in any lead in which it looks prolonged.

• QT interval is measured using either tangent or threshold methods.The threshold method,
measured from the onset of the initial wave of the QRS complex to where the T wave returns to the
isoelectric baseline, has probably been the most commonly used.[1] [37] In the tangent method,
the downslope of the T wave is extrapolated to the isoelectric baseline and this intersection is used
for the end of the T wave. One study comparing the two methods found that the tangent method
resulted in shorter QT intervals than the threshold method, and both methods were found to have
high validity and diagnostic accuracy; however, the two methods need different cut-off values for
use in practice.[38]
• The QT interval can also be measured with digital recordings using on screen calipers. Automated
QT intervals are typically longer than manual measurements in lead II or V5 since they use the
earliest lead for QRS onset and the latest lead for T-wave offset.[1] Some computerized ECG
systems allow visualization of the automated QT interval (and other interval) measurements so they
can be verified. 
• The most commonly used formula to calculate the QTc is Bazett's formula: QT divided by the
square root of the RR interval, where all intervals must be in seconds. The RR interval is the
interval between each QRS complex, and should ideally be that immediately preceding the QT
interval and averaged for 3 to 5 complexes. Sinus arrhythmia may lead to overestimation (or
underestimation) of the QTc with 3 or even 5 complexes, so a broader average RR interval may be
used in such cases.

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Hypokalemia is characterized by ST depression, flattened T waves, prominent U waves, and a
prolonged QT interval.
• Hypomagnesemia in itself does not have well-defined ECG abnormalities but, as it is often
associated with hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, ECG changes associated with these may be
present.
• Hypocalcemia causes isolated prolongation of the QT interval.
Serum electrolyte measurement
Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia may precipitate symptoms in patients with
unrecognized congenital LQTS or be the primary cause of acquired LQTS. Serum electrolytes should
therefore be measured in all patients found to have a prolonged QT interval on ECG.
Holter monitor
All patients with suspected or confirmed congenital LQTS should undergo Holter monitoring, the main
purpose of which is to evaluate the behavior of the QT interval during:
• Bradycardia (at night)
• Tachycardia
• Sudden pauses (e.g., postextrasystolic).
Marked changes in QT morphology during the above changes in heart rate aid diagnosis.[39]
Holter monitoring may also allow the clinician to identify nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias in patients
with LQTS who are asymptomatic, thereby assisting the decision-making process as to whether medical
and/or device therapy should be initiated. A Holter monitor-derived "QT clock" may be used to improve
detection of QT prolongation.[39]
Exercise tolerance testing
All patients with suspected or confirmed congenital LQTS should undergo an exercise tolerance test to
identify abnormal QT interval prolongation during exercise and recovery, which is helpful in:
• Diagnosing LQTS, especially LQT1, in which the QT interval and QTc increase more than those of
the controls or LQT2 and LQT3 patients
• Diagnosing LQTS when the QT interval is borderline prolonged
• Assisting in the prescription of a maximum exercise level for patients presenting with exercise-
induced symptoms of presyncope or syncope, by simulating similar circumstances in a controlled
environment.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography is helpful to assess for and rule out regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive
of myocardial scarring or infarction. It is also helpful in ruling out and characterizing valvular stenotic or
regurgitant lesions.
This investigation should be carried out in patients with suspected structural heart disease as suggested
by a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or valvular heart disease requiring surgical
correction. SCN5A mutations in LQT3 may also exhibit cardiomyopathy.[40]

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
Genetic testing
Determination of the patient's genotype is recommended for all patients with a high probability of
congenital LQTS (Schwartz score ≥3.5).[5] [41] For patients with an intermediate probability of congenital
LQTS (Schwartz score 1.5 to 3), testing of established genes may be considered, mainly to help rule out
a diagnosis.[5] Definitive disease-associated genes are currently KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, and CALM
1, 2, and 3; in patients with a high probability of congenital LQTS, CACNA1C and KCNE1 may also be
considered.[5] For patients with defined syndromes, specific genes should be tested, for example KCNQ1
and KCNE1 in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, or CACNA1C in Timothy syndrome.[5]
The identification of specific gene mutations enables:[5]
• Pinpointing of the exact channelopathy responsible for the LQTS, thus identifying the subtype
• Risk stratification of patients with congenital LQTS
• Mapping of the mutation's inheritance so that family members can be screened
• Initiation of gene-specific prophylactic treatment.
Genetic testing has a sensitivity of approximately 70% to 85% in index cases.[2] [5] It requires expert
interpretation, and can be costly.[5] [42] In the absence of a family history of LQTS, it is not indicated for
asymptomatic individuals with borderline QTc intervals (<480 ms). However, genetic testing is indicated
when there is a very strong clinical diagnosis or when the QTc exceeds 500 ms on serial ECGs and a
reversible cause is absent.[5] [42]
Certain genetic subtypes are associated with particularly severe phenotypes that have a higher incidence
of sudden cardiac death (such as KCNQ1-A341V or SCN5A-G1631D), whereas others are associated
with milder disease.[5] Patients with multiple LQTS gene mutations are at higher risk for breakthrough
cardiac events during follow-up.[43] Family members should have variant-specific genetic testing once
a disease-causing variant has been identified in an index case. Early identification of affected family
members is important, even in those with a normal baseline QTc, and genetic testing can be carried out in
children from birth.[2] [5]
In patients with acquired LQTS, genetic testing for defined disease-associated genes should be offered to
those who experienced drug-induced torsades de pointes, are ages <40 years, and have a QTc interval
>440 ms (males) and >450 ms (females) in the absence of the likely causative drug.[5] In these patients,
a variant can be identified in >60% of cases.[5] Family screening is recommended for patients where a
QT-prolonging drug is prescribed or being considered.[5]
European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that a diagnosis of LQTS is made in the presence
of a pathogenic mutation, regardless of QT interval.[2]
Epinephrine test
This test involves a catecholamine challenge with a brief infusion of epinephrine and must be performed
with immediate access to advanced life support and external defibrillation. It is not recommended by
European guidelines due to low reproducibility.[2] However, it may be helpful in the diagnosis of LQT1 in
which the QT interval and QTc increase more than those of the controls or LQT2 and LQT3 patients.[44]
Electrophysiology study
Investigating for inducible ventricular arrhythmias using electrophysiology studies has not been shown to
have significant value in the diagnosis, treatment, or risk stratification of patients with LQTS.[2]

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
history of known gene mutation (common)
• Includes KCNQ1 gene mutations, KCNH2 gene mutations, SCN5A gene mutations, and CALM gene
mutations.
use of drugs or circumstances known to increase the QT interval (common)
• Some of the drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium and/
or magnesium are quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide,
phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds (Arizona CERT):
drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/login/dlcheck)  Certain cancer
treatments are also known to cause QT prolongation, e.g., kinase inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors,
androgen-deprivation therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies.[23] [24] 
• Electrolyte imbalances and bradyarrhythmias may result in QT prolongation.
syncope during heightened adrenergic tones (common)

syncope during arousal or surprise (common)
• Patients with LQT2 commonly have cardiac events during arousal or when startled, as by a telephone
or alarm clock.
arrhythmic symptoms postpartum (common)
• Female patients with LQT2 are more prone to developing arrhythmic symptoms during the first 9
postpartum months.[35]
syncope at rest and during bradycardia (common)
• Patients with LQT3 commonly have cardiac events at rest and during bradycardia.
cardiac syncope (common)
• Normally secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias.
• Characterized by premonitory symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, and dyspnea. During the
syncopal episode, pallor and cyanosis are common features, and the recovery period is brief and
characterized by flushing.
• Complete atrioventricular block may present with cardiac syncope.
palpitations (common)
• Congenital and acquired LQTS may present with palpitations secondary to premature ventricular
complex and tachyarrhythmias including torsades de pointes.
periodic paralysis (uncommon)

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
dysmorphic features (uncommon)
• Patients with Andersen-Tawil syndrome have a variety of dysmorphic features[10] including
micrognathia, low-set ears, widely spaced eyes, clinodactyly, syndactyly, and scoliosis. The very rare
Timothy syndrome (LQT8) can include dysmorphic features such as small upper jaw, low set ears,
flattened nasal bridge, and cutaneous syndactyly.
sensorineural deafness (uncommon)
• Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is a very severe form of LQTS associated with sensorineural
deafness.[9]
Other diagnostic factors

• Consequence of poor cerebral perfusion due to reduced cardiac output in complete atrioventricular
block and transient ventricular tachyarrhythmias or torsades de pointes.
angina (uncommon)
• Potential symptom of complete atrioventricular block.
fatigue (uncommon)
• Fatigue, listlessness, and poor effort tolerance are symptoms of reduced cardiac output in complete
atrioventricular block.
oliguria (uncommon)
• Consequence of poor renal perfusion due to reduced cardiac output in complete atrioventricular block.
muscle weakness (uncommon)
• Although hypokalemia is normally asymptomatic, it may cause muscle weakness if severe.
tetany (uncommon)
• Hypocalcemia causes tetany, which manifests as carpopedal spasm.
numbness (uncommon)
• Hypocalcemia causes numbness periorally and in the extremities.
Chvostek's sign (uncommon)
• Twitching of facial muscles in response to tapping the facial nerve in the area of the parotid gland,
elicited in hypocalcemia.
Trousseau's sign (uncommon)
• Carpopedal spasm in response to inflation of a blood pressure (BP) cuff creating pressure in the upper
limb greater than systolic BP, elicited in hypocalcemia.
cold and pale extremities (uncommon)
• Signs of reduced cardiac output secondary to compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction may be
present in complete atrioventricular block.
• Extremities may be cyanosed and clammy.

hypotension (uncommon)
• Sign of reduced cardiac output in complete atrioventricular block.
confusion (uncommon)
• Consequence of poor cerebral perfusion due to reduced cardiac output in complete atrioventricular
block.
Risk factors
Strong
KCNQ1 gene mutations
• LQT1 arises from mutations in the KCNQ1 gene. KCNQ1 mutations are the most commonly identified
in genotyped patients. A homozygous mutation in KCNQ1 results in the autosomal recessive Jervell
and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.[16]
KCNH2 gene mutations
• LQT2 arises from mutations in the KCNH2 gene. KCNH2 mutations are the second most commonly
identified, accounting for up to 35% to 45% of genotyped patients.[16]
SCN5A gene mutations
• LQT3 arises from mutations in the SCN5A gene.[16]
QT interval-prolonging drugs
• Ingestion of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is a recognized risk factor in the development of
acquired LQTS, and may reveal subclinical congenital LQTS.[27]
• Some of the drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium and/or
magnesium include quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide,
phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds (Arizona CERT):
drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/login/dlcheck)  Certain cancer
treatments are also known to cause QT prolongation, e.g., kinase inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors,
androgen-deprivation therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies.[23] [24]
hypokalemia
• Hypokalemia causes hyperpolarization of myocardial cell membranes with consequent prolongation of
repolarization, thus prolonging the QT interval.
hypomagnesemia
• Hypomagnesemia causes early afterdepolarizations, which in turn lead to prolonged repolarization of
myocardial cells, thus prolonging the QT interval.
hypocalcemia
• Hypocalcemia prolongs the plateau phase of the action potential, thereby prolonging repolarization of
myocardial cells, thus prolonging the QT interval.

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
bradyarrhythmias
• Any sudden bradycardia or atrioventricular nodal block may result in QT prolongation or pause-
dependent QT prolongation.
central nervous system lesions
• Lesions such as intracranial hemorrhage (especially subarachnoid hemorrhage) and ischemic strokes.
Weak
female sex
• LQTS is more commonly diagnosed in women, which may be a spurious observation resulting from
the higher upper limit for the corrected QT interval (QTc) in postpubertal females than in males (460
ms and 450 ms, respectively), although one report suggests a slightly higher incidence in females on
the basis of genetics.[15]
• In early childhood, boys with LQT1 are more likely to experience syncope or sudden death, but boys
are less likely than girls to have symptoms later in life.[8] [28]
• Women with LQT2 appear to be at higher risk of cardiac arrest, syncope, and/or sudden death than
men and remain at risk into adulthood.[29] [30]
• Number of overall deaths is greater in women than in men.[28]
malnutrition
• Starvation and a liquid protein diet are known triggers of a prolonged QT interval.

Criteria
Schwartz criteria (1993-2012 LQTS diagnostic criteria)[32][33]
The Schwartz criteria are diagnostic criteria for LQTS and are distinct from the criteria used to risk-stratify
patients with known LQTS.
Points are assigned to ECG, clinical, and familial findings. Patients with 3.5 or more points have a high
probability of having LQTS, those with 1.5 or 3 points have an intermediate probability, and those with 1 or no
points have a low probability of having LQTS.
ECG findings (in the absence of medications or disorders known to affect these features)
• Corrected QT interval (QTc), defined as QT interval (in seconds) divided by the square root of the RR
interval (in seconds):
• ≥480 ms = 3 points
• 460-479 ms = 2 points
• 450-459 ms (in males) = 1 point
• QTc 4th minute of recovery from exercise stress test ≥480 ms = 1 point
• Torsades de pointes = 2 points
• Visible T-wave alternans = 1 point
• Notched T wave in 3 leads = 1 point
• Low heart rate for age (resting heart rate below the 2nd percentile for age) = 0.5 points.

Long QT syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Syncope (cannot receive points for both syncope and torsades de pointes)
• With stress = 2 points
• Without stress = 1 point.
• Congenital deafness = 0.5 points.
Family history (the same family member cannot be counted for LQTS and sudden death)
• Family members with definite LQTS = 1 point
• Unexplained sudden cardiac death under age 30 years among immediate family = 0.5 points.
Screening
Prenatal screening
Fetal genetic screening may allow determination of the presence of a given mutation, although the
phenotypic penetrance of the mutation in utero cannot be determined solely on the basis of the genotype.
Fetal genetic screening is not performed in routine clinical practice.
12-lead ECG
Although not universally implemented, in parts of Italy infants and young athletes are screened by ECG for
LQTS.[45] [46]
Models using a 12-lead ECG to screen newborns for LQTS have been developed that appear to be cost-
effective and successful in improving survival.[47]
In the US, there is no screening program of asymptomatic people for LQTS.

Long QT syndrome Management
Approach
Given the increasing prevalence of LQTS and the associated risk of sudden cardiac death, primary care
providers are likely to find themselves encountering challenging management decisions.
The mainstay of treatment for LQTS, unless there is an identifiable reversible cause, is lifestyle modification
and beta-blocker therapy with the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients who have had a
previous cardiac arrest and in those continuing to have symptoms despite beta-blockade.
Acquired LQTS
In acquired LQTS, management involves thorough assessment in order to identify and remove or treat the
causative factor.
• Drug history should be taken to identify and remove drugs known to prolong the QT interval
or cause depletion of potassium and/or magnesium, including quinidine, procainamide,
sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and
methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds (Arizona CERT): drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://
crediblemeds.org/index.php/login/dlcheck)
• Serum electrolytes should be measured and corrected, in cases of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia,
and hypocalcemia; the goals of therapy include achieving a “high normal” potassium (of at least 4.0
to 4.5 mEq).
• Follow-up serial, periodic ECG monitoring is recommended until the QT interval has normalized.
• Any sudden bradycardia or atrioventricular (AV) nodal block may result in QT prolongation or
pause-dependent QT prolongation. If an identifiable cause is not present, treatment involves
implantation of a pacemaker (temporarily if the bradycardia or AV block improves, permanently if
symptomatic bradycardia or AV block persists).
• Beta-blocker therapy, and lifestyle modification with avoidance of any further QT-prolonging drugs
and monitoring, are indicated if removal of the causative drug is not possible due to medical
necessity.
• Prophylactic treatment with beta-blockers and lifestyle modification are not indicated in these
patients if the QT-prolonging agent is identified and removed.
• Cardiac events may include syncope, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, torsades de pointes, or cardiac
arrest. For details of management, see Sustained ventricular tachycardias  and Cardiac arrest .
Some patients with acquired LQTS may ultimately be diagnosed with congenital LQTS, and they should
be managed as other patients with congenital LQTS (e.g., with beta-blockers, lifestyle modifications, and
consideration of ICD).
Congenital LQTS without previous cardiac event
Treatment of congenital LQTS in patients without a previous cardiac event (e.g., syncope, ventricular
tachyarrhythmias, torsades de pointes, or cardiac arrest) is dependent on whether the patient is at low- or
high-risk of events.
Low risk (probability of first cardiac event before age 40 of <49%) is defined as: men or women with LQT1
or LQT2 and QTc <500 ms; men with LQT3 and QTc <500 ms; women with LQT3 (irrespective of level of
QTc prolongation).

Long QT syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
High risk (probability of first cardiac event 50% or higher) is defined as: men or women with LQT1 or
LQT2 and QTc ≥500 ms; men with LQT3 and QTc ≥500 ms.[29]
The 1-2-3 LQTS risk calculator is an alternative risk stratification tool that estimates the 5-year risk of life-
threatening arrhythmias for patients with LQTS based on QT interval and genotype; it may assist in the
identification of patients who would benefit from ICD placement.[2] [48]
Low risk:
• Lifestyle modification and monitoring
• Patients with LQT1 are at increased risk with activities that increase sympathetic activation,
such as swimming, emotional stress, and exercise; they should avoid swimming unless
cleared by LQTS experts, and should avoid extreme exertion until under optimal therapy and
fully counseled.[5]
• Patients with LQT2 are at high risk if woken from sleep or disturbed by a sudden noise.[5]
Removal of alarm clocks and telephones from bedrooms is recommended.[5]
• In general, competitive sports or similar extreme exertion should be avoided by patients with
LQTS. However, patients who wish to engage in competitive sports should be referred for
expert evaluation for risk stratification.[3] In one retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients
with genotype-positive LQTS who were treatment-adherent, their participation in competitive
or recreational sports was not associated with cardiac events or death.[49] Activities that are
of low risk include golf, curling, cricket, billiards, or bowling.[50] Noncompetitive swimming,
especially for LQT1 patients, must be limited and, if performed, should be done under close
supervision. Selected low-risk patients without a history of exercise-induced symptoms may
be considered for sports participation in consultation with an expert in LQTS and with careful
education and consideration of options.[51]
• All patients must avoid other sympathomimetics and factors that may prolong the QT interval,
such as drugs including quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide,
dofetilide, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds
(Arizona CERT): drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/
login/dlcheck)  Consult a drug formulary for a full list of drugs that prolong the QT interval.
• Electrolyte loss due to vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating should be replaced with
electrolyte solutions in order to avoid hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Patients with
LQT2 particularly require adequate potassium levels, and oral supplementation may be
beneficial.[5]
• Beta-blockers
• The mainstay of medical treatment for patients with congenital LQTS is beta-blocker therapy,
ideally nonselective beta-blockers (e.g., nadolol, propranolol).[2] As ventricular arrhythmias
may arise during a state of high adrenergic tone, particularly increasing the occurrence of
afterdepolarizations, beta-blockers are used to blunt adrenergic stimulation.
• Beta-blockers themselves will not shorten the QT interval, but their use is thought to
prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias, although they may provide less protection to patients
with LQT3. Data from one study show that beta-blocker therapy reduces the risk of life-
threatening cardiac events in females with LQT3; however, efficacy in males could not be
determined conclusively because of the low number of events.[52]

Long QT syndrome Management
• The efficacy of beta-blocker therapy may be assessed with exercise tolerance testing to
ensure the heart rate response is blunted.
• Although no randomized controlled trials exist, observational data suggest a strong mortality
benefit with beta-blocker therapy.[28] [53]
• Beta-blocker therapy should also be considered in patients with a normal QTc interval in the
presence of a pathogenic mutation.[2]
High risk:
• Lifestyle modification and monitoring: the recommendations are the same as for low-risk patients.
• Beta-blockers: the recommendations are the same as for low-risk patients.
• Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and in certain
very high-risk patients with LQT1, LQT2, or LQT3, ICD can be considered but expert consultation
should be sought first.[2] This should include a discussion regarding the risks of not having an ICD
and the advantages/disadvantages of an ICD, single- or dual-chamber depending on the individual
patient and following specialist cardiologist or electrophysiologist advice.
• Mexiletine: should be considered in patients with confirmed LQT3, especially those with syncope
or ICD shocks despite beta-blocker therapy; use in other genotypes is being investigated.[5] [54]
[55] Oral testing should be carried out to ensure that the QTc is shortened by at least 40ms before
prescribing mexiletine long term.[2] There is currently no evidence on whether mexiletine should be
given alone or in combination with beta-blocker therapy for patients with LQT3.[2]
• Left cardiac sympathetic denervation: may be considered in patients with recurrent syncope despite
treatment with beta-blockers or in those requiring multiple appropriate ICD shocks.[2] It may also be
an option in patients who are deemed not to be ideal candidates for an ICD, such as children, due
to the physical limitations of age and height and the psychologic distress of ICD shocks. 
Congenital LQTS with previous cardiac event
Cardiac events may include syncope, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, torsades de pointes, or cardiac arrest.
For details of management, see Sustained ventricular tachycardias  and Cardiac arrest .
Lifestyle modification
• Required in all patients with congenital LQTS; the recommendations are the same as for patients
without a previous cardiac event.
Beta-blocker therapy
• Required in all patients with congenital LQTS; the recommendations are the same as for patients
without a previous cardiac event.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
• Use of an ICD, in conjunction with beta-blockers, has proven invaluable in the treatment of patients
with LQTS who have recurrent arrhythmic syncope or documented torsades de pointes despite
optimally dosed beta-blocker therapy.[2] [56] [57]
• ICDs are now considered appropriate therapy for:
• Patients who have had a previous cardiac arrest.[2]

Long QT syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
• Those with recurrent arrhythmic syncope despite beta-blocker therapy, or in those whom
beta-blocker therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated.[2]
• Some patients with high-risk LQTS, especially patients with LQT2 or those with multiple
mutations.[58]
• Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.
Mexiletine
• Should be considered in patients with confirmed LQT3, especially those with syncope or ICD
shocks despite beta-blocker therapy; use in other genotypes is being investigated.[2] [5] [54] [55]
Left cardiac sympathetic denervation
• Sometimes called stellate ganglionectomy, this procedure involves surgical resection of the lower
half of the left stellate ganglion along with several other thoracic ganglia (T2 to T4) in an attempt to
partially denervate the heart.[59]
• This procedure is available at specialized medical centers and referral should be considered for:
• Patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers or in whom beta-blockers are contraindicated[2]
• Those with recurrent arrhythmic syncope despite beta-blocker therapy[2]
• Patients receiving multiple ICD shocks[2]
• Patients in whom ICD implantation is contraindicated or declined[2]
• Children in whom an ICD, due to the physical limitations of age and height and the
psychological distress of ICD shocks, is not appropriate.
• Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.
• Development of a minimally invasive thoracoscopic approach makes left cardiac sympathetic
denervation a more attractive option for these patients. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation is well
tolerated and does not negatively affect cardiovascular performance.[2] Side effects may occur with
this treatment though, and breakthrough events occur in half of the patients after the procedure.[2]
[60]
Permanent pacemaker
• When combined with beta-blockers, atrial (or, less optimally, ventricular) pacing, which prevents
bradycardia, may facilitate the uptitration of beta-blockers to more effective antiarrhythmic doses
and can also serve to prevent pause-dependent torsades de pointes.[61]
• A permanent pacemaker in conjunction with beta-blocker therapy should be considered if:
• The patient continues to have symptoms despite a left cardiac sympathetic denervation
• There is a lack of surgical experience in thoracoscopic left cardiac sympathetic denervation
(and the patient declines referral to a specialized center).
• However, no randomized study exists comparing the efficacy of pacemakers combined with beta-
blockers versus ICDs in preventing symptoms in patients with LQTS. Pacemakers are infrequently
used in LQTS given the similar risks of indwelling leads that an ICD system has and lack of back-up
defibrillation.

patients with LQTS is beta-blocker therapy,
ideally nonselective beta-blockers (e.g., nadolol,
propranolol).[2] As ventricular arrhythmias
may arise during a state of high adrenergic
tone, particularly increasing the occurrence of
afterdepolarizations, beta-blockers are used
to blunt adrenergic stimulation. Beta-blockers
themselves do not shorten the QT interval,
but their use is thought to prevent ventricular
tachyarrhythmias.
» Low-dose beta-blockers are prescribed initially
and titrated up as tolerated.
» Dose adjustments may be required to avoid
symptomatic bradycardia.

Long QT syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
Acute
plus lifestyle modification and monitoring
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Cardiac events may include syncope,
ventricular tachyarrhythmias, torsades de
pointes, or cardiac arrest.
» Electrolyte loss due to vomiting, diarrhea,
or excessive sweating should be replaced
with electrolyte solutions. Patients with LQT2
particularly require adequate potassium levels,
and oral supplementation may be beneficial.[5] 
» Sympathomimetics, factors that may prolong
the QT interval, and startling acoustic stimulation
such as alarm clocks should be avoided
(especially for LQT2 patients).
» Generally, competitive sports and extreme
exertion should be avoided, and noncompetitive
swimming (especially for LQT1 patients) should
be limited and done under close supervision.
However, patients who wish to engage in
competitive sports should be referred for expert
evaluation for risk stratification.[3] Selected
low-risk patients without a history of exercise-
induced symptoms may be considered for
sports participation in consultation with an
expert in LQTS and with careful education and
consideration of options.[51]
» ECG should be monitored annually or
biannually and after initiation or adjustment of
beta-blocker therapy (if applicable).
» Exercise testing and/or Holter monitoring
should be carried out to confirm adequate beta-
blockade after the initiation of beta-blockers (if
applicable), assess ongoing adequacy of beta-
blockade, and augment dosage as necessary
in children undergoing somatic growth (if
applicable).
» Measure serum electrolytes to monitor
for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and
hypocalcemia.
» Review medication for drugs contraindicated in
LQTS.
» Consult a drug formulary for a full list of drugs
that prolong the QT interval.
» Take symptom history for detection of interim
syncope.

Long QT syndrome Management
Acute
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Use of an ICD, in conjunction with beta-
blockers, has proven invaluable in the treatment
of patients with LQTS who have recurrent
arrhythmic syncope or documented torsades
de pointes despite optimally dosed beta-blocker
therapy.[2] [56] [57]
» Indications for an ICD include any of the
following: previous ventricular tachyarrhythmias
and/or torsades de pointes, previous cardiac
arrest, persistent syncope, some patients with
high-risk LQTS, especially patients with LQT2 or
those with multiple mutations, contraindications
or intolerance to beta-blockers.[2] [58]
» Single- or dual-chamber depending on the
individual patient and following specialist
(cardiologist or electrophysiologist) advice.
adjunct mexiletine
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» mexiletine: consult specialist for guidance
on dose
» Should be considered in patients with
confirmed LQT3, especially those with syncope
or ICD shocks despite beta-blocker therapy; use
in other genotypes is being investigated.[2] [5]
[54] [55]
2nd left cardiac sympathetic denervation
» Sometimes called stellate ganglionectomy,
this procedure involves surgical resection of the
lower half of the left stellate ganglion along with
several other thoracic ganglia (T2 to T4) in an
attempt to partially denervate the heart.
» Indications include inadequate response to
or not a candidate for implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD), receipt of multiple ICD shocks,
and children in whom an ICD is not appropriate
due to the physical limitations of age and height
and the psychological distress of ICD shocks.[2]
» A thoracoscopic left cardiac sympathetic
denervation has been developed, and is now
routinely done by experienced surgeons in
specialized medical centers.

» When combined with beta-blockers, ventricular
pacing, which prevents bradycardia, may
facilitate the up-titration of beta-blockers to more
effective anti-arrhythmic doses and can also
serve to prevent pause-dependent torsades de
pointes.[61]

Long QT syndrome Management
Emerging
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)
modulators
Early data suggest that the cystic fibrosis drug lumacaftor/ivacaftor may be of clinical use in LQT2
patients through its action on the hERG (human ether-a-go-go) gene trafficking defect affecting potassium
channels.[5]
Primary prevention
Because congenital LQTS is an inherited condition, primary prevention is not applicable. Early detection and
treatment of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, and avoidance of drugs known to prolong the QT interval
where possible, may prevent some cases of acquired LQTS.
Patients starting QT-prolonging anticancer therapy should have a baseline assessment for underlying risk
factors and have their QT interval monitored before and during treatment.[23] [24]
Secondary prevention
Patients should be advised to avoid drugs known to have the potential to prolong the QT interval or
cause depletion of potassium and/or magnesium, such as quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone,
disopyramide, dofetilide, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds
(Arizona CERT): drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/login/dlcheck) 
Energy drinks that contain large amounts of caffeine may lead to QT prolongation and caution should be
exercised in patients with LQTS.[63]
Patients with LQT2 should avoid startling acoustic stimulation such as alarm clocks. In general, competitive
sports or similar extreme exertion should be avoided by patients with LQTS. However, patients who wish to
engage in competitive sports should be referred for expert evaluation for risk stratification.[3]
Parental genetic counseling and testing prior to conception is recommended to determine the potential risk of
having a child affected with LQTS.
In-vitro fertilization, with implantation of a fertilized oocyte confirmed to be free of the known mutation, may
be an option for parents carrying an affected gene.
Patient discussions
Patients should be advised to:
• Avoid drugs known to have the potential to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium
and/or magnesium, such as quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide,
phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and methadone.[21] [22]  [Credible Meds (Arizona
CERT): drugs that prolong the QT interval] (https://crediblemeds.org/index.php/login/dlcheck) 
Energy drinks that contain large amounts of caffeine may lead to QT prolongation and caution
should be exercised in patients with LQTS.[63]
• Avoid alarm clocks or loud, unexpected noises (especially LQT2 patients)
• Avoid unsupervised swimming (especially LQT1 patients)
• Report any syncopal episodes immediately
• Replace electrolyte loss due to vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating with electrolyte solutions.

Monitoring
EGCs are undertaken routinely on an annual or biannual basis and after initiation or adjustment of beta-
blocker therapy.
Exercise testing and/or Holter monitoring is done to confirm adequate beta-blockade after the initiation of
beta-blockers, assess ongoing adequacy of beta-blockade, and augment dosage as necessary in children
undergoing somatic growth.
Serum electrolyte measurement to monitor for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.
Medication review for drugs contraindicated in LQTS, such as quinidine, procainamide, sotalol,
amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants.  [Credible Meds

Symptom history for detection of interim syncope.
Consideration of genotyping to facilitate family evaluation, and confirmation of full evaluation of family.
Patients with LQTS who undergo general anesthesia require careful perioperative monitoring, as they
are at high risk of torsades de pointes perioperatively. Little is known about the effects of LQTS during
pregnancy, but the incidence of dysrhythmia increases postpartum, so careful monitoring of LQTS
patients in the postpartum period is also required.[62]

Treatment is with intravenous magnesium and electrical cardioversion.
Torsades de pointes with associated pause-dependent VT is additionally treated with temporary ventricular
pacing or isoproterenol.
In addition, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) should be corrected,
and drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium and/or magnesium should be
discontinued.

Emergency treatment is with CPR and defibrillation as per the adult advanced life support protocol.
In addition, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) should be corrected,
and drugs known to prolong the QT interval or cause depletion of potassium and/or magnesium, such
as quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, disopyramide, dofetilide, phenothiazines, and tricyclic

Secondary to cardiac arrest resulting from polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Prognosis
Asymptomatic and undiagnosed
These patients may have normal life expectancy and may remain asymptomatic. Patients with congenital
LQTS may pass on the specific mutation to their offspring, who may then become symptomatic. Prognosis
is variable and depends on risk stratification for the probability of a future cardiac event (syncope, cardiac
arrest, or sudden death), which in turn depends on the history of symptoms, genotype, sex, age, and length
of the corrected QT interval (QTc).
Asymptomatic and diagnosed
These patients may have normal life expectancy and may remain asymptomatic. Treatment with beta-
blockers may be considered if high-risk features are identified. Lifestyle modifications, especially in patients
with congenital LQTS, should be emphasized and encouraged. These patients may progress to become
symptomatic.[43]
Symptomatic with ≥1 syncopal episodes
These patients are at risk of recurrent syncopal episodes. Careful attention must be given to minimize all
identifiable triggers that may prolong the QT interval, including drugs and electrolyte abnormalities. These
patients benefit most from treatment with beta-blockers and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
Symptomatic with cardiac arrest
These patients are at highest risk of recurrent episodes of syncope and/or cardiac arrest. Previous cardiac
arrest carries a higher risk of LQTS-related sudden death. Careful attention must be given to minimize all
identifiable triggers that may prolong the QT interval, including drugs and electrolyte abnormalities. Survival
is enhanced with beta-blocker and ICD therapy.

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
