Pulmonary regurgitation Overview
Summary
Pulmonary regurgitation is incompetency of the pulmonary valve, which results in leakage of blood from the
pulmonary artery back into the right ventricle.
Pulmonary regurgitation may be due to a congenital defect or may be acquired.
Any disease of the left side of the heart or the lungs that results in significant pulmonary hypertension and
dilated pulmonary arteries may lead to acquired pulmonary regurgitation. It may also result from surgical
repair of tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary stenosis, or atresia.
Isolated pulmonary regurgitation is rarely symptomatic; however, large regurgitant volume in the presence
of dilated right ventricle may be associated with exertional dyspnea, easy fatigability, and intermittent chest
pain.
Echocardiography is essential to determine the severity and mechanism of pulmonary regurgitation.
In symptomatic patients with severe regurgitation, pulmonary valve replacement should be considered.
Definition
Pulmonary regurgitation is the leakage of blood from the pulmonary artery back into the right ventricle. It is
rare and is infrequently symptomatic. It gradually develops over many years and results in volume overload
and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. It can be congenital or acquired, caused by conditions that increase
pulmonary artery pressure, such as left ventricular dysfunction or severe lung disease.
The acquired form occurs from any secondary cause that leads to pulmonary regurgitation through increased
pulmonary pressure secondary to left-sided failure, or after surgical intervention for tetralogy of Fallot,
pulmonary stenosis, or pulmonary atresia. Isolated pulmonary regurgitation occurs as a result of any cause
that impacts the valve directly, such as endocarditis.
The murmur of pulmonary regurgitation is diastolic and is associated with RV lift.[1]

Pulmonary regurgitation Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Trace or mild pulmonary regurgitation is commonly detected on echocardiography in patients without
structural heart disease. Nonsevere pulmonary regurgitation is usually asymptomatic and is most commonly
secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Severe isolated pulmonary regurgitation is usually a manifestation
of prior surgical repair or balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty, so patients may present later in life.[2] However,
even with severe isolated pulmonary regurgitation, only 40% of the patients present with symptoms, so the
true incidence and prevalence is unknown. There is no specific sex or ethnicity predominance; however, it is
commonly associated with younger age.[3]
Etiology
Pulmonary regurgitation may be congenital or acquired. In the acquired form it may result from any left-sided
cardiac condition, such as mitral stenosis, or severe pulmonary disease and pulmonary hypertension. Other
known causes are dilation of the pulmonary annulus secondary to pulmonary hypertension or post balloon
valvuloplasty for pulmonary valve stenosis. Endocarditis may destroy the integrity of the pulmonary valve
leaflets, resulting in pulmonary regurgitation.[1] [3] Other conditions that may result in abnormal pulmonary
valve leaflets are congenital anomalies, rheumatic heart disease, carcinoid heart disease, syphilis, and
trauma (e.g., from a Swan-Ganz catheter).[4] Connective tissue disease, such as Marfan syndrome, may
also be an associated cause.[4] Very rarely, it may be caused by primary or metastatic malignancies that
involve the main pulmonary artery.
In addition, the acquired form commonly results decades after surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary
stenosis, or atresia. It has also been associated with the Ross procedure (pulmonary autograft used for
aortic valve replacement).[5]
Pathophysiology
Severe isolated pulmonary valve regurgitation is rare. However, when present, it results in volume overload
and dilation of the right ventricle with compensatory right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy. Eventually, this results
in equalization of the pulmonary artery pressure and the RV pressure in diastole. Furthermore, with severe
progression and RV failure, right-sided stroke volume decreases, leading to peripheral edema, dyspnea, and
easy fatigability.
Pulmonary regurgitation associated with pulmonary hypertension is usually nonsignificant and has few to no
hemodynamic consequences. It is the pulmonary hypertension that results in RV failure and dilation and low
right-sided cardiac output.
The regurgitant pulmonary volume depends on several factors:[3]
• Diastolic filling period
• The regurgitant orifice dimension
• Pressure gradient across pulmonary valve
• Pulmonary artery distensibility
• RV compliance and function.

Case history
Case history #1
A 32-year-old woman with history of repaired tetralogy of Fallot in childhood presents with exertional
dyspnea, easy fatigability, and nonexertional chest pain. On physical examination her jugular venous
pressure is around 10 cm with prominent right ventricular anterior precordial lift. A short, low-pitched,
grade 2/6 diastolic and a loud, grade 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border are heard.
Case history #2
A 52-year-old woman with history of congenital pulmonic stenosis, for which she underwent open
valvotomy at age 9, presents to the adult congenital heart disease clinic for a second opinion, after being
followed by a general cardiologist for several years. She is asymptomatic and has excellent exercise
capacity. Physical examination reveals no jugular venous distension. Auscultation reveals a short, low-
pitched 2/6 diastolic and a loud 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border.

Pulmonary regurgitation Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
History and physical examination are nonspecific, and the patient is often asymptomatic.
History
In a symptomatic patient, exertional dyspnea, easy fatigability, and nonexertional chest pain are the most
common symptoms. The patient may also complain of palpitations, diaphoresis, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, and orthopnea. A history of left-sided heart failure and other valve pathologies such as mitral
stenosis and endocarditis may be present.
A thorough history regarding previous cardiac surgeries and pulmonary valvuloplasty should be obtained,
including repair of tetralogy of Fallot and Ross procedure (with prosthetic pulmonary valve or homograft
valve replacement).
Physical examination
Jugular venous pressure may be elevated and a prominent right ventricular (RV) anterior precordial lift
present. Most commonly, a short, low-pitched diastolic decrescendo murmur and systolic murmur may be
heard along the left sternal border.[6]
Although the likelihood of isolated right-sided heart failure secondary to pulmonary regurgitation is low, it
should be considered in patients with lower extremity edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites.
Tests
ECG may show incomplete right bundle branch block and right axis deviation, findings consistent
with right ventricular dilation that occurs either while in a compensated volume overload state or in a
decompensated pressure overload state. In a compensated state of pressure overload, right ventricular
hypertrophy may be present by ECG criteria that include the following: tall R wave in V1 or qR in V1; R
wave greater than S wave in V1; R wave progression reversal in the precordial leads; inverted T wave in
the anterior precordial leads; right axis deviation and right atrial enlargement. In pulmonary regurgitation
after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, QRS prolongation may be found.
A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) can be used to assess severity, mechanism, etiology, RV size and
function, other valvular abnormalities, and RV systolic pressure, and should be ordered in all patients in
whom pulmonary regurgitation is suspected.[7] Although the pulmonary valve leaflets are often difficult
to visualize by TTE, color flow imaging is most often used for detection of pulmonary regurgitation (PR).
Severity of PR is usually assessed by the diameter of the jet at its origin immediately below the valve,
in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), on the parasternal short axis view. A jet width that occupies
>65% of the RVOT is suggestive of severe PR.[8] The continuous-wave Doppler profile of the PR jet
in the parasternal short axis view is also fundamental in assessing the presence and severity of PR by
TTE. Where mild pulmonary regurgitation will have slow deceleration, the continuous-wave Doppler
signal of severe pulmonary regurgitation will have a steep deceleration returning to baseline by the end
of diastole.[9] Occasionally a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be needed to better assess
the severity and etiology of pulmonary regurgitation.[7] In general, if TTE indicates severe pulmonary
regurgitation, then a TEE would be recommended to better assess the degree and cause of regurgitation.
TEE is also indicated in cases where pulmonary regurgitation is suspected but availability of TTE is
limited. Rarely, the pulmonary valve leaflets may be difficult to visualize by TEE in the mid-esophageal

position as the valve lies in the far field, but may be better characterized from the transgastric views. The
development of 3-dimensional TEE is also improving visualization of these areas.
Catheterization and angiocardiography are less helpful in this setting because they may falsely elevate
the quantity of pulmonary regurgitation as the catheter is crossing the pulmonary valve. Other imaging
modalities, such as chest x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT), are
also useful to identify pulmonary anatomy and the cause of pulmonary regurgitation and to quantify the
degree of regurgitation. Additionally, MRI can measure pulmonary regurgitant fraction, RV end-diastolic
and end-systolic volumes, and RV ejection fraction.[10] [11] In patients where the decision to treat
pulmonary regurgitation is being considered, an MRI and/or CT may be extremely helpful. Cardiac MRI
is now considered the reference standard for quantification of PR, RV size, and RV function in patients
with repaired tetralogy of Fallot. The advantages of cardiac MRI over other imaging modalities in these
patients include accurate and reproducible measurements of the above-mentioned parameters, excellent
image quality in patients with a wide range of body sizes, and the absence of radiation making it a good
choice for longitudinal follow-up.[7][12] CT may be an alternative in patients with contraindications to MRI,
such as pacemakers or other metallic implants.[7]
In patients with chronic pulmonary regurgitation, cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be a useful test to
assess objective functional capacity and to follow patients longitudinally for changes over time related to
worsening RV function.

regurgitation.[1] [3] Details such as balloon size used at pulmonary valvuloplasty and degree of
regurgitation post valvuloplasty should be determined.
endocarditis
• Any condition that may destroy the integrity of the valve leaflets may result in pulmonary
regurgitation.[1] [3]
left-sided heart disease
• Any left-sided condition, such as severe left ventricular dysfunction, that results in pulmonary
hypertension may cause pulmonary regurgitation.[1] [3]

Pulmonary regurgitation Diagnosis
Differentials
Condition Differentiating signs /
symptoms
Differentiating tests
Mitral stenosis • Malar flush, low volume
pulse, a tapping and
undisplaced apex beat, and
loud S1 with an opening
snap.
• The murmur is rumbling and
mid-diastolic.
• CXR: pulmonary edema,
enlarged left atrium, and
mitral valve calcification.
• ECG: can present with atrial
fibrillation. Right ventricular
hypertrophy may also be
present.
• Echocardiogram: diagnostic
for mitral stenosis.
Aortic regurgitation (AR) • In mild AR the murmur is
early diastolic, and increases
in duration to holodiastolic in
severe AR.
• A diastolic murmur may be
absent in acute AR.
• CXR: may show
cardiomegaly in the leftward
and inferior direction in
chronic AR.
• ECG: may show nonspecific
ST-T wave changes, left
axis deviation, or conduction
abnormalities.
• Echocardiogram:
visualization of the origin of
regurgitant jet and its width;
detection of cause of aortic
valve pathology.
Atrial myxoma • The murmur is mid-late
diastolic, and changes in
character and intensity with
alterations in position.
• Echocardiogram:
visualization of a mass,
usually attached to the
interatrial septum or free wall
of the atrium.
Criteria
There are no specific criteria to grade severity of pulmonary regurgitation (PR). Severity of PR is usually
assessed by the diameter of the jet at its origin immediately below the valve, in the right ventricular outflow
tract (RVOT), on the parasternal short axis view. A jet width that occupies >65% of the RVOT is suggestive
of severe PR.[8] Additionally, a dense continuous-wave Doppler signal with a sine wave appearance is
suggestive of severe PR. Occasionally other modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed
tomography may need to be used to assess the right ventricular outflow tract and to identify the etiology of
pulmonary regurgitation.
NYHA functional classification for stages of heart failure
• Class I: no limitation of activities; no symptoms from ordinary activities
• Class II: slight, mild limitation of activity; comfortable with rest or with mild exertion
• Class III: marked limitation of activity; comfortable only at rest
• Class IV: confined to bed or chair; any physical activity brings on discomfort, and symptoms occur at
rest.

Pulmonary regurgitation Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Management of pulmonary regurgitation is different from that of aortic regurgitation and rarely requires
surgery. Treatment should be directed at the underlying pathology (e.g., pulmonary hypertension, mitral
stenosis, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and other underlying conditions). Longstanding pulmonary
regurgitation can lead to severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and diminished RV systolic performance, which
can lead to an inadequate ability to augment cardiac output with exercise and, in some cases, right-sided
heart failure or congestive heart failure. While the likelihood of isolated right-sided heart failure secondary
to pulmonary regurgitation is low, it should be considered in patients with lower extremity edema, elevated
jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, or ascites. In severe cases where right-sided heart failure has
occurred, diuretics may be used. Pulmonary valve replacement is required in patients post tetralogy of Fallot
repair or Ross procedure who develop New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III symptoms, but may
be considered earlier.
There are no specific criteria to grade severity of pulmonary regurgitation (PR). Severity of PR is usually
assessed by the diameter of the jet at its origin immediately below the valve, in the right ventricular outflow
tract (RVOT), on the parasternal short axis view. A jet width that occupies >65% of the RVOT is suggestive
of severe PR.[8] Symptoms and signs of severe pulmonary regurgitation include dyspnea on exertion,
syncope, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. In many situations (e.g., acute pulmonary regurgitation
post valvuloplasty, post-tetralogy of Fallot repair patients with NYHA class II symptoms or higher) the clinical
judgment of severity is more dependent on symptoms than on imaging.
When valve replacement is indicated, transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement is a less invasive approach
than surgery and may be considered in some select patients.[15] [16] Initially transcatheter pulmonary
valve replacement was applied to those patients with prior surgical pulmonary valve replacement or RV
outflow tract conduits, but with new devices this technique is also being successfully applied to patients
with native RV outflow tracts. In those patients with large RV outflow tracts and/or main pulmonary arteries,
surgical pulmonary valve replacement may be the only option, due to sizing of the available devices.[17]
Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement has been demonstrated to have comparable mortality and need
for reintervention when compared to surgical pulmonary valve replacement, but with greater rates of infective
endocarditis.[2] [18]
Acute pulmonary regurgitation
Acute pulmonary regurgitation is an almost unavoidable complication of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty
and can be managed conservatively in most cases. The clinical judgment of severity in these patients
is more dependent on symptoms than on imaging. Severe pulmonary regurgitation post valvuloplasty
is uncommon, affecting 17% of children in one study.[19] Treatment of even the most severe cases is
directed at treating heart failure. Pulmonary valve replacement may be required, especially in a neonate
with critical pulmonary stenosis following balloon dilation and a large patent ductus arteriosus. Fluid
resuscitation and intravenous pressors such as dopamine or dobutamine may be necessary, acutely, for
severe disease.
Chronic pulmonary regurgitation in asymptomatic patients
In most cases, no specific treatment is required for nonsevere pulmonary regurgitation, and treatment is
directed at the underlying cause. There is growing recognition of the role of pulmonary valve replacement
in the asymptomatic patient with evidence of hemodynamically significant pulmonary regurgitation.[20] In
those patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, there are now guideline recommendations for pulmonary

Pulmonary regurgitation Management
valve replacement based on changes in objective exercise capacity, RV end-diastolic and end-systolic
volumes, and RV systolic dysfunction.[15] [16] It is important to note that extrapolation of these criteria
to those patients with isolated pulmonary regurgitation after intervention for pulmonary valve stenosis
may not be appropriate. The typical situation in which pulmonary valve replacement may be considered
is in patients who develop pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, patients with a
dysfunctional RV to pulmonary valve conduit such as in repaired truncus arteriosus or following a Ross
procedure (a procedure in which the diseased aortic valve is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary
valve, and the pulmonary valve is then replaced with a cryopreserved cadaveric pulmonary valve). Many
would share the concern that it may be unwise to wait until RV function deteriorates in these patients,
and that valve replacement should be considered before irreversible damage to ventricular performance
occurs.[20] [21]
Chronic pulmonary regurgitation in patients with NYHA class I
symptoms
Patients are classed as NYHA class I if there is no limitation of physical activity and ordinary physical
activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea, but symptoms appear with more than
ordinary activity.
In most cases, no specific treatment is required. Underlying conditions such as LV failure, mitral stenosis,
and pulmonary hypertension need to be treated. Heart failure should be managed using standard
therapies.[22] Patients who develop pulmonary regurgitation after repair of tetralogy of Fallot or a Ross
procedure may be considered for pulmonary valve replacement, as it may be better to perform valve
replacement early in these patients.[23] If pulmonary regurgitation is severe and associated with right-
sided heart failure, then pulmonary valve replacement may be necessary. There are, however, no
definitive guidelines and the best course of action is unclear.
Chronic pulmonary regurgitation in patients with NYHA class II
or III symptoms
Clinical judgment of disease severity is more dependent on symptoms than on imaging in this situation.
Most patients with NYHA class II or III symptoms have developed pulmonary regurgitation as a
complication of tetralogy of Fallot repair or a Ross procedure. Underlying and associated conditions
such as LV failure, mitral stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension need to be treated. Pulmonary valve
replacement, usually with a homograft or xenograft, has been performed with low risk of complications,
and most specialists would perform pulmonary valve replacement in patients with NYHA class II or III
symptoms.[21] [24]
Chronic pulmonary regurgitation in patients with NYHA class IV
symptoms
Patients are defined as NYHA class IV if they are confined to their bed or chair, any physical activity
brings on discomfort, and symptoms occur at rest. There are no guidelines or standard protocols on
management of these patients. Specialist referral for individualized management is advised in all
circumstances.
Choice of valve replacement
Traditionally bioprosthetic pulmonary valves have been implanted; however, they have the disadvantage
of time-related structural valve failure.[14] Mechanical pulmonary valves have the advantage of long-
term durability, but they have been infrequently used due to concerns regarding thrombosis and difficulty

outcomes of mechanical pulmonary valves are available; however, there is a selection bias for patients
with prior operations in such reports.[25] The appropriate valve used in pulmonary valve replacement
needs to be tailored for the individual patient depending on age, multiple operations, and the need for
long-term anticoagulation. All patients who receive a mechanical valve require lifelong anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation may also be indicated due to the presence of other mechanical prostheses or as part of
the treatment of comorbid conditions.[14]

Patient discussions
If symptoms occur, patients should be reviewed by their physicians. As patients may be at increased
risk of developing infective endocarditis, the risks and requirements for antibiotic prophylaxis should
be discussed before any dental or urologic procedures. Current guidelines recommend prophylactic
antibiotics for patients with prosthetic valves (biological and mechanical, surgical and transcatheter).[15]
Due to increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the population of adults with
congenital heart disease and increased ASCVD morbidity and mortality in this group, patient education
regarding cardiovascular disease risk factors and modification of those risk factors where possible is
recommended.[28]

Pulmonary regurgitation Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Pulmonary regurgitation may worsen over time. Periodic echocardiogram with Doppler color flow studies
will provide serial assessment of progression of pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular size and
function. In cases of significant pulmonary regurgitation, exercise capacity should be assessed and
documented, observing for a change or decrease in function. The aim is to assess and accurately decide
on the need and timing for pulmonary valve replacement.
After pulmonary valve replacement, patients should be followed up at 30 days and then 6 months,
followed by yearly visits. In general, all patients who receive a mechanical valve require lifelong
anticoagulation. International normalized ratio should be monitored and kept between 2.5 and 3.5.
Frequency of monitoring should be individualized according to the patient's need and response.
Transition from pediatric to adult care warrants development of a healthcare transition program.[30]

Pulmonary regurgitation Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
right-sided heart failure long term low
In severe cases where right-sided heart failure has occurred, diuretics may be used. Decision to use
a diuretic would depend on the clinical condition of the patient, and the choice of diuretic should be
individualized by the treating specialist. When the condition is severe, patients may not tolerate any
diuretics. Further information on treatment of heart failure is available in the topics on heart failure.
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction long term low
Longstanding pulmonary regurgitation can lead to severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and diminished RV
systolic performance, which can lead to an inadequate ability to augment cardiac output with exercise and,
in some cases, result in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
valve failure long term low
Patient needs to be re-evaluated and consideration given to repeat valve replacement.
infective endocarditis variable low
All patients with prosthetic valves need antibiotics for prophylaxis against infective endocarditis when
undergoing dental procedures that involve manipulation of either gingival tissue or the periapical region of
teeth, or perforation of the oral mucosa.[14]
thromboembolic events variable low
In general, all patients who receive a mechanical valve require lifelong anticoagulation. INR should be
monitored and kept between 2.5 and 3.5. Frequency of monitoring should be individualized according to
the patient's need and response.
complications of valve replacement variable low
Early mortality for isolated pulmonary valve replacement is 1% in children, and freedom from
reoperation for bioprosthetic valve deterioration is approximately 90% at 10 years.[27] In patients with
transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement, mortality, and reintervention at 8 years was 8.9% and 25.1%
respectively.[29] Patients with mechanical pulmonary valve should be monitored for bleeding complications
with warfarin.
Prognosis
In general, patients do well after pulmonary valve replacement.[6] [21][23] Early mortality for isolated
pulmonary valve replacement is 1% in children and freedom from reoperation for bioprosthetic valve
deterioration is approximately 90% at 10 years.[27] Patients with mechanical pulmonary valve should be
monitored for bleeding complications with warfarin.

Pulmonary regurgitation Follow up
Prognosis in patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation who do not undergo surgery (although they may
be candidates) depends on a number of factors, which include the primary disease causing pulmonary
regurgitation, involvement of other valves, associated coronary artery disease, and right ventricular dilation
and dysfunction. In patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and chronic pulmonary regurgitation, right
ventricular dilation has been shown to correlate with an increased incidence of sudden death.[20]
There are no large trials of prosthetic valves in patients with isolated pulmonary regurgitation to provide
evidence for the prognosis in untreated patients.
Patients may be at an excess risk of acquired cardiovascular disease and associated cardiovascular mortality
compared to the general population, due to factors including abnormal anatomy, reperfusion injuries following
surgical intervention, hypertension, ventricular hypertrophy, and associated genetic syndromes.[28]

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
