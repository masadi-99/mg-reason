Atrial myxoma Overview
Summary
Atrial myxoma is the most common of the rare benign primary cardiac tumors.
Usually found in the left atrium and typically attached to the septum.
Most common presentation is with symptoms of mitral valve obstruction, followed by embolic manifestations.
Constitutional symptoms include fever, fatigue, and weight loss.
The only definitive treatment is surgical.
Definition
Myxoma is the commonest cardiac tumor and constitutes 50% of all benign cardiac tumors in adults, but only
15% of such tumors in children. About 75% of primary cardiac tumors are benign. Most myxomas are found
in the left atrium (75%) and, in decreasing frequencies, in the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle.

Atrial myxoma Theory
Epidemiology
Malignant and benign primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare, with a reported incidence in autopsy series
of 0.02%.[2] Myxoma is the commonest cardiac tumor, and constitutes 50% of all benign cardiac tumors in
adults.[3] It is not as common in children and accounts for only 15% of such tumors. About 75% of primary
cardiac tumors are benign. Most myxomas are found in the left atrium (75%) and, in decreasing frequencies,
in the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. The incidence of myxomas peaks at 40 to 60 years of
age. They are more common in women, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1.[4]
Etiology
The exact etiology of atrial myxoma is unknown and most cases are sporadic. Familial atrial myxomas have
an autosomal-dominant transmission, but these account for <10% of the total. Although familial myxomas
may be transmitted without any associated disorders, they may present as a component of a Carney
complex, an autosomal dominant condition comprising myxomas at various sites, endocrine tumors, and
spotty pigmentation of the skin.[5] [6] [7]
Pathophysiology
The exact origin of myxoma cells remains uncertain, but they are thought to arise from remnants of
subendocardial cells or multipotential mesenchymal cells in the region of the fossa ovalis, which can
differentiate along a variety of cell lines. The hypothesis is that cardiac myxoma originates from a
pluripotential stem cell, and myxoma cells express a variety of antigens and other endothelial markers.
Myxomas can be formed by pedunculation with a short broad base (85% of myxomas), but sessile forms
can also occur.[4] Myxomas are yellowish, white, or brownish, and are frequently covered with thrombus.[3]
 The tumor size ranges from 1 cm to 15 cm and can weigh from 15 g to 180 g.[4] The surface of the
myxoma is smooth in the majority of cases but it can also be friable or villous. The villous or papillary
form of myxoma has a surface that consists of multiple fine or very fine villous, gelatinous, and fragile
extensions that have a tendency to fragment spontaneously and are associated with embolic phenomena.[8]
Histologically, myxomas are composed of myxoma (lepidic) cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and
an undifferentiated form embedded within an acid mucopolysaccharide ground substance and covered by
endothelium.[9]
Classification
Benign primary cardiac tumors
Atrial myxoma is one of a number of benign primary cardiac tumors:
• Myxoma
• Papillary fibroelastoma
• Fibroma
• Lipoma
• Rhabdomyoma.

THEORY
Case history
Case history #1
A 40-year-old woman presents with dyspnea that is worse when she lies on her left side. About one
week ago she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Clinical examination shows a
diastolic murmur, which is prominent when the patient lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is
present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest x-ray shows
pulmonary congestion, and echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum.
Case history #2
A 58-year-old man presents with dyspnea. Chest x-ray shows small pleural effusion and enlarged
pulmonary arteries. Echocardiogram shows large right atrial mass.
Other presentations
Patients may present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, cough, low-grade fever, arthralgia,
myalgia, weight loss, erythematous rash, and laboratory findings of anemia and increased erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and gamma globulin levels. Less commonly they may have
thrombocytopenia, clubbing, cyanosis, or Raynaud phenomenon. There are also case reports on of the
presence of intracerebral aneurysms in association with atrial myxoma.[1]

Atrial myxoma Diagnosis
Approach
Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and a finding of a cardiac mass on echocardiogram, which is
most commonly present in the left atrium. The cardiac mass in the atrium most frequently (in 80% of cases)
arises from the region of the septal fossa ovalis.[4] The diagnosis is confirmed by histologic examination. The
specimen for histology is obtained from either surgery or biopsy via thoracotomy or a transvenous approach.

History and exam
Most clinical presentations related to myxoma result from mitral valve obstruction (syncope, dyspnea,
and pulmonary edema) followed by embolic manifestations.[4] [8] Other symptoms include weight loss,
fatigue, unexplained fever, and anemia. Atrial myxoma may result in sudden death. Myxoma involving
the right atrium may present with pulmonary embolism. Physical exam may reveal a systolic murmur or
a diastolic murmur suggestive of mitral stenosis. A tumor plop may also be heard (a low-pitched diastolic
sound as the tumor prolapses into the left ventricle).  [Texas Heart Institute: heart sounds auscultation]
(http://www.texasheart.org/Education/CME/explore/events/eventdetail_5056-presentation.cfm)  [4] [8] In
one study the most common auscultation findings were systolic murmur (in 50% of cases) followed by
loud first heart sound (32%), an opening snap (26%), and a diastolic murmur (15%).[8] Systolic murmur
may be caused by damage to the valves, failure of coaptation of the leaflets, or narrowing of the outflow
tract by the tumor. Diastolic murmur is present due to obstruction of the valve caused by the myxoma.
Tumor plop may be confused with a mitral opening snap or a third heart sound and can be detected in up

to 15% of cases.[4] In one study, a cardiac auscultation abnormality was detected in 64% of patients.[4]
Chest examination may reveal fine crepitations consistent with pulmonary edema.
Extremity examination may also reveal signs of embolic phenomenon. The signs vary depending on the
vascular territory involved. Involvement of cerebral vessels results in neurologic signs; involvement of
coronary arteries may result in an acute myocardial infarction; intestinal obstruction may result in ischemic
bowel; and peripheral arterial obstruction can result in limb-threatening ischemia.
Imaging
Initial investigations are echocardiogram, ECG, and CXR, and are followed by either a CT or MRI scan.
CT and MRI scans provide better delineation of the intracardiac mass, extent of tumor, and extracardiac
structures.[10] They also provide anatomical definition for preoperative planning and may also help to
identify whether the mass is solid, hemorrhagic, or fatty.

• Anemia (49% of patients)
• Elevated serum gamma globulin (45% of patients)
• Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (55% of patients)
• Elevated serum C-reactive protein (75% of patients).[8]
Biopsy
Biopsy is useful in certain conditions, such as differentiating a thrombus from tumor if not already
differentiated by echocardiogram or MRI/CT scan. It is also helpful in identifying tumors that are
unsuitable for surgical resection (e.g., metastatic cardiac tumor) and providing a histologic diagnosis,
allowing patients to be treated with chemotherapy if appropriate.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
dyspnea (common)
• One study found dyspnea to be the most common symptom and present in >50% of patients.[8]
syncope (common)
• Common initial symptoms are related to mitral valve obstruction (dizziness, syncope, pulmonary
edema, congestive heart failure [CHF]), which is present in >50% of patients.[4] Syncope alone has
been found to be the presenting symptoms in 14% of patients.[8]
dizziness (common)
• Common initial symptoms are related to mitral valve obstruction (dizziness, syncope, pulmonary
edema, CHF), which is present in >50% of patients.[4]
CHF/pulmonary edema (common)
• Common initial symptoms are related to mitral valve obstruction (dizziness, syncope, pulmonary
edema, CHF), which is present in >50% of patients.[4]
embolic manifestations (common)
• Embolic manifestations are present in 16% to 27% of patients.[4] [8]
• Embolization of cardiac myxomas is more likely to occur in patients presenting with preoperative atrial
fibrillation and in papillary-type tumors that are smaller in size.[11] The presence of an irregular or
friable (villous) surface is associated with an increased risk of embolization.[4] [8]
systolic or diastolic murmur (common)
• In one study the most common auscultation findings were systolic murmur (in 50% of patients)
followed by loud first heart sound (32%), an opening snap (26%), and a diastolic murmur (15%).[8]
tumor plop (uncommon)
• A tumor plop may be heard in up to 15% of patients.[4]

Connective tissue disease • Symptoms of arthralgia and

Other cardiac tumors • There may be no differences

• Imaging studies (e.g., CT

Criteria
There are no specific criteria. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and finding of a cardiac mass,
which is most frequently present in the left atrium. The cardiac mass in the atrium most commonly (in
80% of cases) arises from the region of the septal fossa ovalis.[4] The diagnosis is confirmed by histologic
examination. The specimen for histology is obtained from either surgery or biopsy via a thoracotomy or
transvenous approach.
Screening
Due to the potential of autosomal-dominant transmission, immediate family should be screened with
echocardiogram. Genetic testing is not routinely performed, but patients with Carney complex may have
PRKAR1α gene mutations. As this disorder is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern, first degree
relatives are at risk of developing cardiac myxomas. They may be offered genetic testing, so that they can be
followed closely with periodic echocardiogram.

Atrial myxoma Management
Approach
The only definitive treatment of cardiac myxoma is surgical removal. Surgery should be done as soon
as possible. The timing of surgery is dictated by the general condition of the patient, associated medical
conditions, and availability of an experienced surgeon. Prior to surgery, or in cases where surgery is not an
option, any associated clinical conditions such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or embolic phenomena should
be treated.
Treatment
Generally, after median sternotomies, the myxoma is surgically excised using cardiopulmonary bypass
and cardioplegic arrest. The tumor is removed by either right or left atriotomy or combined atriotomy,
depending on the site and extent of the tumor. The choice of technique also depends on associated
conditions that need surgical intervention such as valve repair or replacement, and coronary artery
bypass graft. Postoperatively, there is no definitive recommendation for anticoagulation if the myxoma is
removed. However, postoperative aspirin or anticoagulation should be considered if an embolic event has
occurred or if there are other indications for such therapy, though the evidence base for such an approach
is lacking.
Medical therapy may be required for the treatment of associated conditions, which include arrhythmias,
heart failure, and embolism.
• Arrhythmias are treated with the appropriate antiarrhythmic drug until surgery can be performed.
• If there is any evidence of residual heart failure, then appropriate long-term therapies (e.g., beta-
blockers, ACE inhibitors, and furosemide) may be needed in individual cases.
• No guidelines or recommendations exist regarding treatment of embolic phenomena in cases of
myxoma. The definitive treatment is surgical removal of the cardiac tumor.
• The treatment of embolic phenomena depends on the vascular territory involved. In cases where
large vessels are involved, anticoagulation is started based on an initial diagnosis of vascular
occlusion, but the definitive treatment is surgical removal of the myxomatous tissue.[12]
• The occlusive mass, unlike acute coronary thrombosis, is not composed mainly of platelet-rich
thrombus. Hence, both intracoronary thrombolysis and mechanical revascularization may be
unsuccessful in patients presenting with myocardial infarction due to cardiac myxoma.[13] [14]
Patients who have extensive comorbidities with poor prognosis and who are not candidates for cardiac
surgery are treated conservatively, with medical therapy directed at these specific complications if they
occur. The role of anticoagulation in these patients is not established and should be individualized.

Emerging
Cardiac autotransplantation
Cardiac autotransplantation may be considered for complex cases and those carried out in specialized
centers.[15] Cardiac autotransplantation is a technique mainly involved for resection of complex cardiac
tumors. The technique of autotransplantation involves cardiac explantation, ex vivo tumor resection with
cardiac reconstruction, and cardiac reimplantation.
Patient discussions
Patients should be instructed to follow up at regular intervals. In the event of any dyspnea, ankle swelling,
palpitations, dizziness, syncope, any evidence of systemic embolization, fatigue, or prolonged fever, they
are to promptly contact their physician or visit the nearest hospital.

Atrial myxoma Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Surgical resection of atrial myxoma has an excellent prognosis with low perioperative complications
and low recurrence rates, although lifelong follow-up is needed.[16] [17] Several factors are involved in
recurrence: for example, incomplete resection, tumor embolization, transformation of benign to malignant
lesion, and presence of single or multiple tumors. In cases of successful removal the risk of recurrence is
low. In one study, 1 in 63 patients (1.6%) had a recurrence during a median follow-up of 12 years.[18] The
affected patient had previous spread of myxomatous tissue close to the pulmonary vein, which was not
radically resected.
Recurrence may be more likely when the patient's myxoma is part of a complex of other associated
findings (pigmented lesion of the skin, skin myxomas, fibroadenoma of breast, adrenal cortical
disease).[23]

Atrial myxoma Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
general surgical complications short term low
The complications related to surgery are as encountered in other surgical procedures (e.g., pneumonia
and deep vein thrombosis).
myxoma surgical complications short term low
Specific complications related to myxoma surgery include: 1) arrhythmias (most commonly atrial
arrhythmias); 2) heart block; 3) constrictive pericarditis; 4) postpericardiotomy syndrome; and 5)
complications related to other associated procedures done with myxoma surgery, such as valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.[4] [8] [20] [21]
Arrhythmia occurs in 16% of patients,[8] arrhythmia or atrial ventricular disorder in 26%,[4] atrial
arrhythmia in 35%, pneumonia in 4.3%, cardiac tamponade in 4.3%, ventricular tachycardia in 2.2%, and
brain infarction in 2.2%.[20]
In another study postoperatively cerebral complications were noted in 10% of the patients, cardiac
arrhythmias in 22.5%, and pericardial effusion in 4%.[22]
emboli long term high
No guidelines or recommendations exist regarding treatment of embolic phenomena in cases of myxoma.
The definitive treatment is surgical removal of the cardiac tumor.
Rarely, myxoma can embolize and this tissue can grow at a distant site. This is possibly a myxoid variant
of cardiac sarcoma as the classic myxoma is not a malignant tumor that metastasizes.
The treatment of embolic phenomena depends on the vascular territory involved. In cases where large
vessels are involved, anticoagulation is started based on an initial diagnosis of vascular occlusion, but the
definitive treatment is surgical removal of myxomatous tissue.[12]
The occlusive mass, unlike acute coronary thrombosis, is not composed mainly of platelet-rich thrombus.
Hence, both intracoronary thrombolysis and mechanical revascularization may be unsuccessful in patients
presenting with myocardial infarction due to cardiac myxoma.[13] [14]
Emboli may trigger small vessel inflammation and mimic a small-vessel vasculitis. Full dermatologic
recovery has been reported with removal of the myxoma.[19]
Anticoagulation, with or without antiplatelet therapy, is usually prescribed in the setting of an embolic
phenomenon. Long term therapy of such agents after surgery is individualized.
heart failure variable high
If there is any evidence of residual heart failure, then appropriate long-term therapies (e.g., beta-blockers,
ACE inhibitors, and furosemide) may be needed in individual cases.
arrhythmias variable low
If there is any associated condition (e.g., arrhythmias), then long-term medications may be needed to
control the arrhythmias. The incidence of arrhythmias increases in the postoperative period.

Atrial myxoma Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Prognosis
Recurrence
Surgical resection of atrial myxoma has an excellent prognosis with low perioperative complications and low
recurrence rates, although lifelong follow-up is needed.
In a series of 153 patients who were surgically operated for atrial myxoma, the reported recurrence rate
(during mean follow-up of 5.2±1.8 years, range: 2 to 10 years) was 3.3%, with an inhospital mortality, from
sepsis, of only one patient (0.7%).[16]
In another study of 403 patients undergoing resection of atrial myxoma, the early inhospital mortality rate
was 0.7% and, during a median follow-up period of 4.5 years (range: 0.5 to 15 years), the tumor recurrence
occurred in six patients (1.5%).[17]Another case series reported a recurrence rate of 5%.[4]
The overall prognosis after successful removal of cardiac myxoma is very good. In one series, the overall
survival after surgery at a median follow-up of 13 years (range 1 month to 42 years) was 87%.[18]

comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
