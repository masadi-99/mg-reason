Hypertriglyceridemia Overview
Summary
Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) can be classified either according to the severity of triglyceride (TG) elevation or
whether it is primary or secondary.
Primary HTG is rarely monogenic and typically polygenic in nature; secondary causes of HTG include
lifestyle factors, medical conditions, and drugs.
Mild-to-moderate HTG is associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease while
severe HTG may cause acute pancreatitis.
Treatment begins with lifestyle modification and control of secondary factors.
Additional therapies include statins, fibrates, and prescription omega-3 acids.
Definition
HTG is defined as elevated fasting plasma triglyceride (TG), typically >75th or >95th percentile for age
and sex.[1] In the US, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines define
moderate HTG as fasting or nonfasting TG 175-499 mg/dL (2.0 to 5.6 mmol/L) and severe HTG as fasting TG
≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L).[2] Other lipoprotein abnormalities are often also present.[3] Patients with HTG
have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and a severely elevated TG level (>885 mg/
dL [>10 mmol/L]) is associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis.[3] [4]

Hypertriglyceridemia Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
HTG is commonly encountered in clinical practice.[5] [13] Depending on the definition, the overall prevalence
ranges from 10% to 25% in the adult population with considerable interregional variation.[5] [13] [15] [16] [17]
The prevalence of mild-to-moderate HTG has been rising over the past few decades in parallel with obesity,
insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.[5] [18] Prevalence of severe HTG, defined as plasma triglyceride
(TG) concentration >885 mg/dL (>10 mmol/L), ranges from 0.10% to 0.20%, and prevalence of very severe
HTG, defined as TG >1770 mg/dL (>20 mmol/L), ranges from 0.010% to 0.020%.[5]
Etiology
HTG may be genetic (primary) or acquired (secondary). Genetic causes may be monogenic or polygenic, but
a monogenic cause is relatively rare.[5] [13]
Primary/genetic causes include monogenic chylomicronemia (formerly known as hyperlipoproteinemia
[HLP] type 1 or familial chylomicronemia syndrome), multifactorial or polygenic chylomicronemia (formerly
HLP type 5 or mixed hyperlipidemia), multifactorial or polygenic HTG (formerly HLP type 4 or familial HTG),
dysbetalipoproteinemia (formerly HLP type 3 or dysbetalipoproteinemia), and combined hyperlipoproteinemia
(formerly HLP type 2B or familial combined hyperlipidemia).[5] [12]
Secondary factors may contribute to clinical expression of HTG, but this often occurs on a background of
polygenic susceptibility. Secondary causes of HTG include medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and drugs:[4]
[5] [9]
• Medical conditions: diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, chronic kidney
disease, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, pregnancy (particularly in the third trimester when
triglyceride elevation associated with pregnancy is peaking), myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus,
liver disease, HIV infection, Cushing syndrome, sarcoidosis
• Lifestyle factors: excessive alcohol consumption; diet high in saturated fat, sugar, or high glycemic
index foods; sedentary lifestyle
• Drugs: glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, oral estrogens, thiazide and loop diuretics,
noncardioselective beta-blockers, isotretinoin, bexarotene, propofol, bile acid sequestrants,
cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, capecitabine, interferon, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine,
protease inhibitors, second-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine).
Pathophysiology
Triglycerides (TG) are transported in the body in TG-rich lipoproteins that are composed of core lipids (TG
and cholesterol esters) and surface apolipoproteins, phospholipids, and free cholesterol; the two main types
of TG-rich lipoproteins are chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).[5] [13] Chylomicrons
are secreted by the intestine and transport exogenous (dietary) TG, while VLDL is secreted by the liver and
transports TG of endogenous origin.[13] [19] VLDL particles are delivered to peripheral tissues where they
are metabolized by endothelial-bound lipoprotein lipase (LPL) for energy utilization (muscle tissue) or storage
(adipose tissue).[19] Both chylomicron and VLDL particles are cleared by a common pathway that centers
on LPL, which leaves remnant particles for catabolism.[19] Both chylomicron and VLDL remnants are taken
up by the liver, though some VLDL remnants undergo further hydrolysis by hepatic lipase, which leads to
generation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.[13] The level of TG circulating is determined by the

Hypertriglyceridemia Theory
efficiency of both LPL-mediated lipolysis and subsequent uptake of remnant particles, which are saturable
mechanisms, and as secretion rates and plasma TG levels rise, lipolysis falls.[19] [20] [21]
When LPL activity is decreased for either genetic or acquired reasons, clearance of TG-rich lipoprotein
particles of both exogenous and endogenous origin is impaired, resulting in their accumulation in the
blood.[5] [19] Extrinsic factors such as overweight or obesity, consuming a diet high in saturated fat or
high glycemic index foods, and ethanol consumption can lead to HTG by increasing chylomicron and
VLDL production. Interventions that lower TG levels can both reduce VLDL production and promote VLDL
clearance, or both.[5] [19]
Other lipoprotein disturbances associated with HTG include an increase in non-high-density lipoprotein (non-
HDL) cholesterol levels, because VLDL and remnants are important components of the non-HDL family
of lipoproteins.[22] [23] [24] [25] Also, apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels are typically increased, because full-
length apoB-100 is a key structural component of both VLDL and its remnants.[23] The levels of remnant
cholesterol are elevated in HTG, and it appears that the cholesterol content of remnant particles is much
more proactively atherogenic than the TG content.[22] Also, patients with HTG have increased levels of
qualitatively deleterious and highly atherogenic small, dense LDL particles.[22] [23] Finally, HDL particles
are almost always decreased in patients with HTG; decreased activities of cholesterol ester transfer protein
(CETP) and LPL result in decreased production and altered HDL composition, which increases HDL
catabolism.[19] [26] The principal clinical consequence of mild-to-moderate HTG is the incremental or
residual risk of the end points of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as myocardial
infarction and stroke, after accounting for levels of atherogenic LDL cholesterol.[27] In contrast, the main
clinical concern of severe HTG is the heightened risk of acute pancreatitis, especially in children and young
adults with monogenic familial chylomicronemia syndrome due to severe genetic impairment of plasma
lipolysis.[28] In adults with severe HTG due to multifactorial chylomicronemia, there is additional risk of
ASCVD endpoints on top of increased risk of acute pancreatitis.[28]
Classification
HTG can be classified two ways: 1) according to the severity of the triglyceride (TG) elevation; and 2) whether
the TG elevation is primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired).[5] [6]
Historical classifications for HTG phenotypes were based on qualitative and quantitative biochemical
differences in plasma lipoproteins (e.g., the Fredrickson or World Health Organization International
Classification of Diseases [ICD] hyperlipoproteinemia [HLP] phenotypes).[7] However, most laboratories no
longer have the technology or know-how to perform this complex phenotyping. Furthermore, no randomized
controlled evidence exists to show that clinical outcomes are altered through use of this system. Therefore, a
streamlined classification system based simply on the TG level is currently preferred.[5]
Different guidelines and societies have different values for classification of severity of HTG.
• Endocrine Society:[8]
• Normal TG: <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L)
• Mild HTG: 150-199 mg/dL (1.7 to 2.3 mmol/L)
• Moderate HTG: 200-999 mg/dL (2.3 to 11.2 mmol/L)
• Severe HTG: 1000-1999 mg/dL (11.2 to 22.4 mmol/L)
• Very severe HTG: ≥2000 mg/dL (>22.4 mmol/L)
• American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology:[2]

• Moderate HTG: 175-499 mg/dL (2.0 to 5.6 mmol/L)
• Severe HTG: ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L)
Note: for moderate HTG, the 2021 American College of Cardiology expert consensus uses a
definition of fasting TG ≥150 mg/dL (≥1.7 mmol/L) or nonfasting TG ≥175 mg/dL (≥2.0 mmol/L)
and TG <500 mg/dL (<5.6 mmol/L).[9]
• Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program:[10]
• Normal fasting TG: <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L)
• Borderline elevated TG: 150-199 mg/dL (1.7 to 2.3 mmol/L)
• High TG: 200-499 mg/dL (2.3 to 5.6 mmol/L)
• Very high TG: ≥500 mg/dL (>5.6 mmol/L)
• European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society:[11]
• Mild-to-moderate HTG: 175-885 mg/dL (2-10 mmol/L)
• Severe HTG: >885 mg/dL (>10 mmol/L)
The fact that various classification schemes exist indicates that no single scheme is the most useful or
predominant in the clinic.
Case history
Case history #1
A 63-year-old woman with diabetes presents with an episode of retrosternal chest pain and diaphoresis
that occurred while walking upstairs earlier that day. Her examination is unremarkable except for blood
pressure 156/96 mmHg and abdominal obesity. A recent lipid profile showed triglyceride 335 mg/dL (3.8
mmol/L), total cholesterol 243 mg/dL (6.29 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 142 mg/dL (3.68
mmol/L), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 34 mg/dL (0.88 mmol/L). Her electrocardiogram shows
no acute changes.
Case history #2
A 56-year-old obese man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with symptoms of
nausea, vomiting, and worsening abdominal pain after a dinner of steak, French fries, and wine. On
examination he has diffuse abdominal tenderness, which is most marked in the left upper quadrant.
Eruptive xanthomas are noted on his back and forearms. His triglyceride level is 2500 mg/dL (28.3 mmol/
L) and his blood glucose is 364 mg/dL (20.2 mmol/L). Serum lipase levels are elevated and abdominal
ultrasound shows evidence of pancreatitis.
Other presentations
HTG is typically clinically silent and is usually detected by lipid screening.[5] Presence of physical
findings in severe HTG is becoming less common, likely due to earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment.[12] There are no symptoms or physical findings in patients with mild-to-moderate HTG, unless
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has developed, which can lead to symptoms of acute coronary
syndromes. However, some secondary factors underlying HTG, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus,

metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease), renal disease, or hypothyroidism, are themselves associated with specific clinical features.[4]
[13]
Characteristic clinical features of chylomicronemia include eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis,
hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting.[14] Less common clinical features
include intestinal bleeding, pallor, anemia, irritability, diarrhea, seizures, and encephalopathy.[14] Infants
with familial chylomicronemia syndrome can present with failure to thrive and abdominal pain.[14]

Hypertriglyceridemia Diagnosis
Approach
Typically, patients are asymptomatic and HTG is detected on routine blood testing.[5] Clinical suspicion for
HTG should be raised in patients with unexplained atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or acute
pancreatitis. A lipid profile should also be obtained in patients with any of the known precipitating factors.
History
A family history of hyperlipidemia or diabetes should be sought. Historical features may include symptoms
of ASCVD (angina, claudication), recurrent abdominal pain, or known secondary causes of HTG.
Secondary causes of HTG include medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and drugs:[4] [5] [9]
• Medical conditions: diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, partial or
generalized lipodystrophy, chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, pregnancy
(particularly in the third trimester when triglyceride [TG] elevation associated with pregnancy is
peaking), myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus, liver disease, HIV infection, Cushing syndrome,
sarcoidosis
• Lifestyle factors: excessive alcohol consumption; diet high in saturated fat, sugar, or high glycemic
index foods; sedentary lifestyle
• Drugs: glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, oral estrogens, thiazide and loop diuretics,
noncardioselective beta-blockers, isotretinoin, bexarotene, propofol, bile acid sequestrants,
cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, capecitabine, interferon, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine,
protease inhibitors, second-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine).
Symptoms and signs
The presence of symptoms and signs of HTG is related to the degree of TG elevation. There are no
symptoms or physical findings in patients with mild-to-moderate HTG. Patients with severe HTG and
chylomicronemia develop characteristic features, which include eruptive xanthomas (raised crops of small
yellowish papules encircled by erythematous halos that appear on extensor surfaces of the extremities,
the buttocks, and the shoulders) and lipemia retinalis (whitish-pink appearance of retinal vessels and
retinal pallor with pinkish hue detected on fundoscopic exam).[20] [52] Other characteristic symptoms and
signs of chylomicronemia include hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal pain, and nausea and vomiting. Much
less common clinical features (<10% of patients) include intestinal bleeding, pallor, anemia, irritability,
diarrhea, seizures, and encephalopathy.[14] Infants with familial chylomicronemia syndrome can present
with failure to thrive and abdominal pain.[14]

Initial laboratory testing
TG level is obtained as part of a routine lipid panel that also includes total and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol, along with a calculated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and calculated non-
HDL-cholesterol. Non-HDL-cholesterol is a derived measurement that is stable irrespective of fasting
status. Calculated LDL-cholesterol is not accurate if TG >400 mg/dL (>4.6 mmol/L). A 12- to 14-hour
period of fasting is recommended to obtain optimal values of TG. Nonfasting TG has been proposed to
be more convenient to measure and has been strongly associated with atherosclerosis risk.[53] However,
if nonfasting TG is so high that LDL-cholesterol cannot be calculated, a repeat fasting lipid profile is
recommended. Acute illnesses and physiologic stress can transiently raise TG levels; values should be
confirmed on repeat testing, especially if diagnosis is made during an acute illness.
In the US, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines define moderate
HTG as fasting or nonfasting TG 175-499 mg/dL (2.0 to 5.6 mmol/L) and severe HTG as fasting TG ≥500
mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L).[2] Different guidelines and societies have different thresholds for classification of
HTG and consulting local guidance may be appropriate.[8] [10] [11]
Measurement of apolipoprotein B (apoB) is becoming more available and more popular; however, there
are currently no universal standards. ApoB measurement is stable irrespective of fasting status and
provides an integrated index of all atherogenic lipoproteins, including LDL, very low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL), and TG-rich remnant particles and lipoprotein(a).[24] Determination is not affected by fasting and
can provide an indirect index of LDL particle size.

Subsequent investigations
Secondary causes for HTG should be routinely sought, including laboratory tests for hypothyroidism,
diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypoalbuminemia, or liver dysfunction.[47] Abdominal ultrasound can help
detect steatotic (fatty) liver. Pursuing cardiac imaging to assess coronary blood flow and myocardial
perfusion would depend on the development of concomitant symptoms and signs of ischemic heart
disease or ASCVD.[54]

Key diagnostic factors
eruptive xanthomas (uncommon)
• These are characteristic small yellowish papules, frequently surrounded by an erythematous base, that
appear predominantly on the buttocks, elbows, and other pressure-sensitive areas. These are caused
by deposition of large amounts of chylomicron triglyceride in cutaneous histiocytes in patients with
severe HTG.

Other diagnostic factors
increased BMI/waist circumference (common)
• Prevalence of HTG increases with the severity of obesity, which is reflected by increased body mass
index.[55] Furthermore, elevated triglyceride (TG) is more common in the setting of abdominal obesity,
which is reflected by increased waist circumference, a "vital sign" to be included with each physical
exam.[56] 
lipodystrophy (common)
• In patients with partial lipodystrophy, characteristic features such as paucity of fat on extremities
and gluteal region with preservation of central subcutaneous fat store, acanthosis nigricans and
hepatosplenomegaly are present.
features of coronary artery disease (common)
• Elevated triglyceride (TG) and TG-rich remnant particles in particular have been implicated as causal
factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as coronary
artery disease and stroke.[23] [53] Clinical suspicion for HTG should be raised in patients with
unexplained ASCVD.

Hypertriglyceridemia Diagnosis
claudication (common)
• HTG is associated with atherosclerosis-related peripheral vascular disease.[54] [57]
neurologic features (common)
• Patients with severe HTG due to chylomicronemia occasionally have been reported to have confusion
(“brain fog”), irritability, difficulty concentrating, and very rarely seizures.
recurrent abdominal pain (uncommon)
• Abdominal pain in patients with severe HTG due to chylomicronemia may occur as a result of either
pancreatic inflammation or hepatosplenomegaly from fat infiltration. HTG is a strong risk factor for
pancreatitis, with 3% to 5% per year incidence for individuals with triglyceride (TG) >885 mg/dL (>10
mmol/L) and an exponential increase in risk with TG >1770 mg/dL (>20 mmol/L). Occasionally, severe
vomiting has been observed to cause esophageal rupture with gastrointestinal bleeding leading to
anemia.[4] [52]
Risk factors
Strong
family#history of hyperlipidemia
• HTG, and especially chylomicronemia, is often the result of an underlying genetic predisposition,
which can be familial (autosomal recessive) or multifactorial (polygenic).[29] [30] First-degree obligate
heterozygote relatives of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome can have triglyceride
levels that range from either normal to mild-to-moderate HTG to severe HTG.[25] Intergenerational
inheritance thus appears confusing because a simple dominant genetic model does not apply.[29]
In multifactorial severe HTG, which can result from either heterozygous rare variants or accumulated
common variants in a polygenic score, the inheritance pattern appears even more erratic and
divergent from simple Mendelian rules.[29] HTG tends to cluster in families, although its expression in
individual family members does not follow an obvious or classical pattern of segregation. Nonetheless,
it is prudent to screen the lipid profile of close family members of an HTG patient.[29]
high saturated fat diet
• This type of diet can increase triglyceride production and lead to HTG in predisposed individuals.[31]
Monounsaturated fats, such as canola or olive oil, have been suggested as a better alternative to
carbohydrates for replacing the calories provided by dietary saturated fats in some patients with HTG.
More extreme diets, such as the ketogenic diet, have been shown to exacerbate hyperlipidemia in
certain patients.[32]
high carbohydrate or high glycemic index diet
• This type of diet can increase triglyceride production and lead to HTG in predisposed individuals.[33]
[34] Monounsaturated fats, such as canola or olive oil, have been suggested as a better alternative
to carbohydrates for replacing the calories provided by dietary saturated fats in some patients with
HTG. More extreme diets, such as the ketogenic diet, have been shown to exacerbate hyperlipidemia
in certain patients.[32]

Hypertriglyceridemia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
excessive alcohol consumption
• Excessive ethanol consumption (>1 and >2 units daily, respectively, for women and men), both acutely
and chronically, can increase triglyceride production and suppress lipoprotein lipase activity, leading to
HTG.[35]
family or personal history of overweight/obesity
• Obesity is strongly associated with HTG and also has a strong but complex genetic component,
independent of lipoprotein metabolism genes.[5] Elevated triglyceride (TG) is a component of the
metabolic syndrome definition.[36] Close family members of a patient with HTG may report a history of
obesity or overweight.[37] Weight reduction lowers triglyceride levels.[26]
family or personal history of diabetes
• Both mild-to-moderate and severe HTG with chylomicronemia can result secondarily from poor
glycemic control in patients with either type 1 or 2 diabetes.[21] [26] Because both types of diabetes
are themselves strongly genetic in nature, close family members of a patient with HTG may report a
history of diabetes. Thus, first-degree relatives should be screened for both dyslipidemia and diabetes.
insulin resistance
• Clinical disorders related to insulin resistance (including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type
2 diabetes) increase the risk for HTG.[19] [26] Insulin resistance leads to decreased lipolysis and
triglyceride clearance.[19] [26]
liver disease
• There is a strong epidemiologic and mechanistic relationship between HTG and metabolic dysfunction-
associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis
(MASH) (previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,
respectively).[38] Triglyceride levels are increased due to overproduction of hepatic very low-density
lipoproteins and levels can be improved concurrent with improvement of MASLD/MASH.[38]
renal disease
• Nephrotic syndrome is associated with upregulation of production of hepatic apolipoprotein B-
containing lipoproteins including very low-density lipoproteins, although total and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol are also increased.[39] Renal toxins in end-stage renal disease can suppress
lipoprotein lipase activity, resulting in increased plasma triglyceride levels.[39]
HIV infection
• HTG is the commonest lipid disturbance in patients with HIV, and can be very severe on occasion.[40]
[41] Multiple mechanisms underlie dyslipidemia in these patients, including direct effects of the virus
itself on metabolic pathways, and also the impact of antiretroviral therapy, particularly first-generation
protease inhibitors, which can both increase production and impair breakdown of triglyceride-rich
lipoprotein particles.[40] [41]
use of certain drugs
• A wide range of drugs can, through a variety of underlying mechanisms, result in HTG in some, but not

tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, and second-generation antipsychotic agents
(e.g., clozapine, olanzapine).[5] [13] There is individual variability in susceptibility to HTG secondary to
drugs.[29] Certain genetically predisposed patients seem more likely to develop HTG with exposure to
drugs associated with HTG.
Weak
Cushing syndrome
• A risk factor for HTG, mirroring the risk seen with use of exogenous glucocorticoids.[42]
inflammatory/immune disorders
• Includes such conditions as sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple myeloma.[43]
[44] [45] Use of glucocorticoids or chemotherapy in these conditions may also be an exacerbating
factor.
organ transplant
• A risk factor for HTG, possibly related to therapeutic use of glucocorticoids and
immunosuppression.[46]
hypothyroidism
• This is considered to contribute to HTG by reducing triglyceride clearance but is more commonly
associated with hypercholesterolemia.[47]
pregnancy
• Plasma triglyceride levels normally increase during pregnancy, and usually this is not severe and does
not result in complications. Rarely, severe gestational HTG can result in life-threatening complications
including acute pancreatitis, hyperviscosity syndrome, and possibly preeclampsia.[48]

triglyceride level
• A 12- to 14-hour period of fasting is recommended to obtain optimal
values.
• Triglyceride (TG) level is obtained as part of a routine lipid panel that
also includes total and HDL-cholesterol, along with a calculated LDL-
cholesterol and calculated non-HDL-cholesterol. Non-HDL-cholesterol
is a derived measurement that is stable irrespective of fasting status.
Calculated LDL-cholesterol is not accurate if TG >400 mg/dL (>4.6
mmol/L).
• Nonfasting TG has been proposed to be more convenient to measure
and has been strongly associated with atherosclerosis risk.[53]
However, if nonfasting TG is so high that LDL-cholesterol cannot
be calculated, a repeat fasting lipid profile is recommended. Acute
illnesses and physiologic stress can transiently raise TG levels;
values should be confirmed on repeat testing, especially if diagnosis
is made during an acute illness.

apolipoprotein B
• This test is stable irrespective of fasting status and provides an
integrated index of all atherogenic lipoproteins, including LDL,
very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and triglyceride-rich remnant
particles and lipoprotein(a).[24] Determination is not affected by
fasting and can provide an indirect index of LDL particle size. While
it is becoming more available and popular, there are no universal
standards yet.

patients being treated
for dyslipidemia is <70
mg/dL (<0.7 g/L) in some
guidelines
fasting plasma glucose
• Because insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes often
occur in patients with HTG, and are potentially modifiable, fasting
plasma glucose should be part of laboratory assessment.
• Normal is <90 mg/dL (<5 mmol/L), while impaired fasting glucose is
>110 mg/dL (>6 mmol/L) and diabetes is >126 mg/dL (>7 mmol/L) on
two occasions. Additional criteria for diabetes include HbA1c ≥6.5%
(≥48 mmol/mol) or abnormal glucose tolerance test results.

BUN, creatinine
• A variety of renal disorders including renal failure, nephrotic
syndrome, and end-stage renal disease with dialysis are associated
with increased triglyceride levels.
analytes are elevated in
renal failure, nephrotic
syndrome, and end-stage

urinary albumin/protein
• Because nephrotic-range proteinuria is associated with dyslipidemia,
urinary protein levels should be determined, initially by routine
urinalysis screening and determining the urinary albumin-to-creatinine
ratio. If this screening is concerning or suggestive, a 24-hour urinary
collection for albumin or protein should be pursued.
analytes are elevated in
nephrotic syndrome
serum albumin
• Hypoalbuminemia is associated with HTG, perhaps through indirect
increase in hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production.
analytes are low in
nephrotic syndrome or

thyroid-stimulating hormone
• Hypothyroidism increases the risk for HTG, but more often high LDL-
cholesterol and hypercholesterolemia. Normal thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) range 0.4 to 4.0 milli-international units/L.
TSH is elevated in primary
hypothyroidism
liver function tests
• Transaminases and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), but usually
not bilirubin, may be elevated in metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatohepatitis (MASH) or other types of liver disease.
transaminases and GGT
may be abnormal: 2- to 3-
fold elevated
C-reactive protein
• The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) assay can detect
elevations in the 0.2 to 0.5 mg/dL (2-5 mg/L) range, which may
indicate associated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD). The routine CRP assay is sensitive to much higher levels
(i.e., >0.8 mg/dL [>8 mg/L]) as seen in inflammatory disorders.
if CRP is moderately
elevated, this can signal
increased risk of ASCVD;
if it is markedly elevated,
this may indicate an
associated inflammatory

Hypertriglyceridemia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Current criteria for diagnosis differs between guidelines and societies.
• Endocrine Society:[8]
• Normal TG: <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L)
• Mild HTG: 150-199 mg/dL (1.7 to 2.3 mmol/L)
• Moderate HTG: 200-999 mg/dL (2.3 to 11.2 mmol/L)
• Severe HTG: 1000-1999 mg/dL (11.2 to 22.4 mmol/L)
• Very severe HTG: ≥2000 mg/dL (>22.4 mmol/L)
• American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association:[2]
• Moderate HTG: 175-499 mg/dL (2.0 to 5.6 mmol/L)
• Severe HTG: ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L)
Note: for moderate HTG, the 2021 American College of Cardiology expert consensus uses a
definition of fasting TG ≥150 mg/dL (≥1.7 mmol/L) or nonfasting TG ≥175 mg/dL (≥2.0 mmol/L)
and TG <500 mg/dL (<5.6 mmol/L).[9]
• European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society:[11]
• Mild-to-moderate HTG: 175-885 mg/dL (2-10 mmol/L)
• Severe HTG: >885 mg/dL (>10 mmol/L)
Screening
Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and can be treated
with appropriate interventions. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College
of Endocrinology guidelines recommend that all adults 20 years of age or older should be evaluated for
dyslipidemia every 5 years, with more frequent testing recommended as patients become older.[58] In the
UK and Europe, lipid screening usually starts at age 40.[11] [59] Screening may begin earlier for those with
diabetes in childhood or a family history of dyslipidemia.

Hypertriglyceridemia Management
Approach
The two main objectives in the management of individuals with HTG are:
• Prevention of adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes such as myocardial
infarction, stroke, and revascularization procedures
• Prophylaxis of acute pancreatitis episodes.
For both aims, there are no specific evidence-based, guideline-recommended treatment target levels for
triglyceride (TG).
Triglyceride targets
The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines suggest
a framework consisting of two HTG categories: moderate HTG (fasting or nonfasting TG 175-499 mg/
dL [2.0 to 5.6 mmol/L]) and severe HTG (fasting TG ≥500 mg/dL [≥5.6 mmol/L]).[2] For moderate HTG,
the 2021 ACC expert consensus uses a definition of fasting TG ≥150 mg/dL (≥1.7 mmol/L) or nonfasting
TG ≥175 mg/dL (≥2.0 mmol/L) and TG <500 mg/dL (<5.6 mmol/L).[9] The AHA/ACC guidelines state
that there are many causes of elevated very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and recommend that it is
reasonable to reduce VLDL levels to reduce risk of ASCVD.[2] In patients with severe HTG, elevated
VLDL and remnant particles raise ASCVD risk, and fasting chylomicrons increase the risk of acute
pancreatitis; therefore, the AHA/ACC guidelines suggest that therapies should address excesses in all
classes of TG-rich lipoproteins.[2]
The 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines
recommend that TG levels <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L) are associated with lower ASCVD risk.[11] They
further state that if TG levels are higher than this, efforts at global cardiovascular risk modification should
be undertaken, focusing on other risk factors such as LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure. The 2017
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE)
guidelines explicitly state that TG <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L) is a goal for patients at risk of ASCVD.[58]
In patients with severe HTG and TG ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L), reduction of TG levels is recommend to
reduce risk of acute pancreatitis.[2] [9]
Nonpharmacologic approaches
Epidemiologic studies show that patients with mild-to-moderate HTG generally are at increased risk of
ASCVD.[53] In patients with mild-to-moderate HTG, it is therefore reasonable to reduce both atherogenic
VLDL and associated risk factors by nonpharmacologic means where possible. This can best be achieved
by identification and treatment of the multiple underlying causes of elevated TG. Secondary causes of
HTG include medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and drugs:[4] [5] [9]
• Medical conditions: diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, chronic
kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, pregnancy (particularly in the third
trimester when TG elevation associated with pregnancy is peaking), myeloma, systemic lupus
erythematosus, liver disease, HIV infection, Cushing syndrome, sarcoidosis
• Lifestyle factors: excessive alcohol consumption; diet high in saturated fat, sugar, or high glycemic
index foods; sedentary lifestyle
• Drugs: glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, oral estrogens, thiazide and loop diuretics,
noncardioselective beta-blockers, isotretinoin, bexarotene, propofol, bile acid sequestrants,

Hypertriglyceridemia Management
MANAGEMENT
cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, capecitabine, interferon, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine,
protease inhibitors, second-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine).
The same initial approach applies to patients with severe HTG. Most patients with severe HTG also have
multiple ASCVD risk factors and are at risk of developing ASCVD. This risk is imparted by atherogenic
VLDL and remnant particles, plus other factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and hyperglycemia.
While chylomicrons themselves are not atherogenic, in adult patients chylomicronemia is associated with
other atherogenic factors. As in individuals with mild-to-moderate HTG, in those with severe HTG it is
reasonable to reduce TG by nonpharmacologic means where possible. This is achieved by identification
and treatment of the multiple underlying causes of elevated TG, as indicated above.
Nonpharmacologic management in all HTG patients therefore includes: limitation or abstinence of alcohol;
avoidance of simple carbohydrates; low-fat diet (<30% of total daily caloric intake) and when TG level
>1000 mg/dL (>11.3 mmol/L), a very low-fat diet (<15% of total daily caloric intake); weight loss; strict
glycemic control in patients with diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism; treatment of hypothyroidism;
control of other secondary causes; and avoidance of drugs that increase TG, if possible, or substitution
with an available metabolically neutral alternative.[9] [14] Referral to a registered dietitian nutritionist
should be considered depending on TG level.
Individuals with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) are a special case because of the severe
genetic deficiency of lipolytic capacity. These individuals must follow a stringent low-fat diet (<15% of
daily caloric intake from fat), which presents a challenge over a lifetime.[5] [14] [21] Medium-chain fatty
acids can provide an alternate source of dietary fat given their direct absorption into the portal circulation
with no reliance on chylomicron formation.[21] Given this strict dietary regimen, supplementation with
essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins can be considered.[21] Referral to a lipid specialist should be
considered.
Pharmacologic management of mild-to-moderate HTG to reduce
ASCVD risk
The ACC defines persistent HTG as fasting TG ≥150 mg/dL (≥1.7 mmol/L) following a minimum of 4-12
weeks of lifestyle intervention, a stable dose of maximally tolerated statin therapy when indicated, and
evaluation and management of secondary causes.[9] There are few contemporary randomized studies
that have primarily recruited patients with HTG and treated them with TG-lowering drugs. Therefore, the
2018 AHA/ACC guidelines do not specifically address mild-to-moderate HTG directly.[2] Instead, patients
are treated based on their ASCVD risk and LDL-cholesterol levels, primarily using statins. In patients
with mild-to-moderate HTG, statin therapy reduces VLDL to a similar degree as fibrates, and statin trials
have included HTG patients. Therefore, the 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines suggest that if an adult patient
with moderate HTG has poorly controlled risk factors for ASCVD and a 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥7.5%,
it is reasonable to either initiate or intensify statin therapy.[2] For those with a 10-year ASCVD risk 5%
to <7.5% and persistent HTG, patient-clinician discussion is recommended regarding the initiation of
moderate-intensity statin therapy.[2] [9]
To further reduce LDL-cholesterol, it may be necessary to add adjunctive treatments such as ezetimibe,
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, or bempedoic acid; however, these have
only minimal impact on TG and are not recommended for treatment of HTG.[60]
For information on calculating the 10-year risk of ASCVD, see Hypercholesterolemia .
The ESC/EAS guidelines concur with AHA/ACC guidelines and recommend statins as the first drug of
choice to reduce ASCVD risk in high-risk individuals with TG levels >200 mg/dL (>2.3 mmol/L).[11]

Hypertriglyceridemia Management
The REDUCE-IT trial found that among patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels despite the use of
statins, addition of high-dose icosapent ethyl led to a significant reduction in the risk of ASCVD events
and cardiovascular mortality.[61] The REDUCE-IT trial also reported that patients on active treatment
had a slight but statistically significant increased risk of hospitalization with atrial fibrillation (AF; 5.3% vs.
3.9% in placebo) and in mild bleeding events (2.7% vs. 2.1% in placebo).[61] While some jurisdictions
have issued warnings regarding these risks, it is noted that the marked overall cardiovascular benefits
have largely offset these concerns.[61] The US guidelines advise that addition of icosapent ethyl may be
considered in patients with persistent TG ≥150 mg/dL (≥1.7 mmol/L) despite maximally tolerated statin
therapy and consideration of lifestyle factors. Patients with moderate HTG considered for icosapent ethyl
in US guidelines include those with ASCVD and either LDL-cholesterol <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L) or LDL-
cholesterol 70-99 mg/dL (1.8 to 2.6 mmol/L), or those age >50 years without ASCVD, but with diabetes
and one or more high-risk factors for ASCVD.[9] [62] The ESC/EAS recommends that in high-risk patients
with TG levels between 135-499 mg/dL (1.5 to 5.6 mmol/L) despite statin treatment, icosapent ethyl
should be considered in combination with a statin.[11] [61] In contrast to the AHA/ACC, the ESC/EAS also
recommends that in patients who are at LDL-cholesterol goal and with TG levels >200 mg/dL (>2.3 mmol/
L), fenofibrate may be considered in combination with a statin.[11]
Pharmacologic management of severe HTG
In severe HTG the most pressing issue is reduction of the risk of acute pancreatitis.[5] [52] Statins alone
cannot reduce TG levels in individuals with severe HTG, especially in the face of unmanaged secondary
causes. Statins alone cannot prevent acute pancreatitis in individuals with severe HTG. Fibrates and
possibly omega-3 fatty acids are the most effective current drug treatments to achieve this.[63] [64] Once
TG has been lowered well into the mild-to-moderate HTG range, ASCVD risk reduction (see above) can
be subsequently considered.[2] [11] [58] In patients with poorly controlled diabetes, optimizing glycemic
control (e.g., with weight loss, metformin, sodium-glucose transporter-2 [SGLT2] inhibitors, glucagon-
like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists, or insulin) can be associated with dramatic improvements in TG
levels, although the mechanism(s) underlying improvement are not directly in the lipoprotein metabolism
pathway.[65] See Type 2 diabetes in adults .
To prevent acute pancreatitis, the AHA/ACC guidelines suggest it is reasonable to reduce TG levels in
patients with TG >500 mg/dL (>5.6 mmol/L).[2] This reduction can be partially achieved by the above
nonpharmacologic approaches, implementing a very low-fat diet, and then by adding a fibrate and/or
omega-3 fatty acids for patients with persistently severe HTG. These are the most reliable pharmacologic
therapies to reduce TG to a safer level. If a fibrate is necessary for a patient being treated with a
statin, fenofibrate is safer than gemfibrozil, with a lower risk of statin-associated muscle complications,
particularly severe myositis and rhabdomyolysis.[2]
The AHA/ACC recommends that in adults with severe HTG and ASCVD risk >7.5%, it is reasonable to re-
evaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently
elevated TG level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy.[2] For those with a
10-year ASCVD risk 5% to <7.5% and persistent HTG, patient-clinician discussion is recommended
regarding the initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy.[2] [9]
The AHA/ACC further recommends that in adults with TG ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L), and especially
fasting TG ≥1000 mg/dL (≥11.3 mmol/L), it is reasonable to further reduce TG by implementing a very
low-fat diet, avoiding refined carbohydrates and alcohol, taking prescription omega-3 fatty acids, and,
if necessary, fibrate therapy.[2] [9] In individuals with TG ≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L), a ≥30% reduction
in TG is possible with prescription omega-3 fatty acids.[62] One European regulatory review found

Patients with acute pancreatitis due to chylomicronemia should be admitted to hospital. They should
have intravenous hydration and take nothing by mouth during the acute phase of illness (first 48-72
hours). Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange is generally not necessary because TG levels will fall with
a half-life of 24-30 hours with cessation of oral intake and supportive care alone. Patients should then
be transitioned to clear fluids, followed by a low-fat diet with advice for long-term lifestyle modification.
Intravenous insulin infusion in patients with poorly controlled diabetes may help reduce TG levels.
See Complications .
Once TG levels are <440 mg/dL (<5 mmol/L), LDL-cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins can be
commenced to achieve non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol target goals as recommended
according to cardiac risk factor status. Optimal goal is TG <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L), but is typically not
realistic. Fibrate therapy is recommended as prophylaxis against future pancreatitis episodes.[2] [9]

MANAGEMENT
Emerging
Treatments to reduce apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III)
Apo C-III is a protein that circulates with triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins, affects lipoprotein metabolism,
and is associated with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk.[67] Volanesorsen,
an antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit the formation of apo C-III, impairs translation of apo C-III
mRNA.[68] [69] [70] The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved volanesorsen as an adjunct
to diet in adults with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) who are at high risk
for pancreatitis, and in whom a response to diet and triglyceride-lowering therapy has been inadequate.
Volanesorsen causes thrombocytopenia, and it is contraindicated in patients with chronic or unexplained
thrombocytopenia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not approve volanesorsen because of the
risk of thrombocytopenia. Olezarsen, a ligand conjugated antisense oligonucleotide targeting apo C-III, has
been shown to reduce TG by >50% and acute pancreatitis risk by >85% in patients with FCS and also to
reduce TG levels in patients with mild-to-moderate HTG who are considered to be at risk for ASCVD.[71] [72]
 Olezarsen is approved by the FDA as an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adults with FCS. However,
this indication is for a rare and severely affected genetic subgroup of patients and is not for standard severe
HTG or mild-to-moderate HTG. Olezarsen is not approved in Europe as yet. Therefore, due to its limited
indication and lack of availability, olezarsen is not routinely used in clinical practice yet. Plozasiran, an
investigational small interfering RNA (siRNA) drug, has been shown to reduce TG levels and incidence
of acute pancreatitis in patients with severe HTG and with mixed hyperlipidemia, and a clinical trial of this
agent in patients with FCS is pending.[73] [74] [75][76] Plozasiran is being reviewed by the FDA for approval.
Olezarsen and plozasiran are not meant to be given during episodes of acute pancreatitis, but instead for
prevention of future HTG-related episodes.
Treatments to reduce angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3)
ANGPTL3 is another genetically validated target for HTG to reduce cholesterol, triglycerides, and ASCVD
risk.[77] [78] The monoclonal antibody evinacumab and the investigational antisense therapies vupanorsen
and zodasiran reduce ANGPTL3, and have shown reductions of triglyceride levels of 50% to 80%.[68]
[79] However, development of both vupanorsen and zodasiran has been terminated by their respective
manufacturers due to concerns over potential adverse effects and a lack of efficacy.
Novel krill-derived omega-3 phospholipid/free fatty acid
Omega-3-phospholipid/free fatty acid (omega-3-PL/FFA) is a new investigational agent derived from krill
oil. Pooled data from the TRILOGY 1 and 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials showed that in patients
with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting TG levels from 500 to 1500 mg/dL), omega-3-PL/FFA reduced
blood triglyceride levels compared with placebo at 12 weeks (26.0% compared with 15.1%), with reductions
persisting at 26 weeks, and that omega-3-PL/FFA was safe and well tolerated.[80]
Primary prevention
Identification and management of modifiable secondary factors is key to reducing risk of HTG. Secondary
causes of HTG include medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and drugs:[4] [5] [9]
• Medical conditions: diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity, chronic kidney
disease, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, pregnancy (particularly in the third trimester when
triglyceride elevation associated with pregnancy is peaking), myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus,
liver disease, HIV infection, Cushing syndrome, sarcoidosis
• Lifestyle factors: excessive alcohol consumption; diet high in saturated fat, sugar, or high glycemic
index foods; sedentary lifestyle
• Drugs: glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, oral estrogens, thiazide and loop diuretics,
noncardioselective beta-blockers, isotretinoin, bexarotene, propofol, bile acid sequestrants,

cyclophosphamide, asparaginase, capecitabine, interferon, tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine,
protease inhibitors, second-generation antipsychotic agents (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine).
Increased physical exercise and a diet low in saturated fat, sugar, or high glycemic index foods may reduce
risk directly and through reduction in risk of medical conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, or
insulin resistance.[13] [49] Excessive alcohol consumption (>1 and >2 units daily, respectively, for women
and men) should be avoided.[35] The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults at
increased risk of cardiovascular disease are offered behavioral counseling interventions to promote a
healthy diet and physical activity; those not at high risk may also be considered for behavioral counseling
interventions.[50] [51]
Drugs that raise triglycerides should be reviewed and metabolically neutral substitutes should be considered.
Medical conditions associated with elevated triglyceride levels should be identified and managed
appropriately.
Secondary prevention
Adherence to a lifestyle that improves weight management by reduced calories from saturated fats, coupled
with regular physical activity, is the most important approach to prevent HTG and its complications, including
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and acute pancreatitis.
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that adults ages 40 to 75 years who have
dyslipidemia and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater should be started on a
statin for prevention of CVD. Those with 10-year risk of 7.5% to less than 10% may selectively be offered a
statin.[96]
Patient discussions
General guidelines for achieving a healthy lifestyle can be found at the US Department of Agriculture's
MyPlate website.  [US Dept of Agriculture: MyPlate.gov] (https://www.myplate.gov)  These are addressed
to adults and contain information about food groups, portion size, nutrient-dense foods, exercise, and
tracking food intake/activity.

Monitoring
Monitoring
Triglyceride (TG) levels should be monitored every 6 weeks during initiation and optimization of treatment.
Once desirable levels are achieved and are stable, the lipid profile should be checked every 6-12 months.
Liver function tests should be checked before using statins or fibric acid derivatives. Recheck each time
the dose is adjusted, then monitor every 6-12 months once on a stable dose.
In addition to reviewing pharmaceutical instructions, practitioners should emphasize the role of lifestyle,
particularly diet and exercise, in reducing TG levels.

Hypertriglyceridemia Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) long term high
Epidemiologic and genetic studies establish triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants as important
contributors to ASCVD and its individual components (e.g., ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease), although it remains methodologically challenging to
definitively claim that HTG is an independent risk factor for ASCVD.[94]  
aortic stenosis variable medium
HTG has been associated with an increased risk for aortic stenosis, primarily due to increased triglyceride-
rich remnant lipoproteins.[95]
acute pancreatitis variable medium
Risk of acute pancreatitis is low to moderate when triglyceride (TG) >885 mg/dL (>10 mmol/L ) and is
high when TG >1770 mg/dL (>20 mmol/L). Initial diagnostic and therapeutic steps should be the same
as in other causes of acute pancreatitis due to severe HTG with chylomicronemia. A TG level should be
determined in all cases of acute pancreatitis as severe HTG may contribute even when the primary cause
is obvious (e.g., alcohol). Cessation of all oral intake and bowel rest is the most essential therapeutic
intervention. Initially, intravenous dextrose should be avoided as this may further increase TG levels.
Intravenous insulin infusion in patients with poorly controlled diabetes often helps reduce TG levels.
Heparin infusion and plasmapheresis are not helpful above and beyond cessation of oral intake, and
are not routinely recommended. Very low-grade evidence suggests plasmapheresis might rarely be
considered in certain situations, such as pregnancy, when TG >1770 mg/dL (>20 mmol/L) and acute
pancreatitis risk is imminent. TG levels rebound rapidly after plasmapheresis if the root cause is not
properly managed.
Long-term complications of recurrent acute pancreatitis include increased length of hospital stay,
development of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic abscess,
pancreatic pseudocyst, systematic inflammatory response syndrome, and increased mortality.
Fibrates and a low-fat diet are recommended as prophylaxis against future episodes of pancreatitis.
Chronically, the absolute risk of pancreatitis is low when TG <440 mg/dL (<5 mmol/L).
Prognosis
The prognosis for HTG patients with respect to prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or acute
pancreatitis is improved significantly with lowering of triglyceride levels to the recommended ranges.[93] This
will require ongoing long-term therapy with monitoring of plasma lipids as well as side effects. Once plasma
lipid levels are stable within the desirable range, they can be monitored along with liver function tests every
6-12 months.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,

any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
