Patent foramen ovale Overview
Summary
Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common finding, reported in approximately 10% of people undergoing
contrast echo.
Usually asymptomatic but may be associated with cryptogenic stroke.
Atrial septal aneurysm is a risk factor for PFO, and when present in combination is associated with an
increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
Asymptomatic patients are generally observed without medical intervention.
In patients younger than 60 years with PFO and cryptogenic stroke, percutaneous PFO closure with
antiplatelet therapy is recommended.
Multidisciplinary approach in the evaluation of patients with cryptogenic stroke and shared decision making
by involving patients are essential in identifying the best management option.
Routine closure of the PFO is not recommended in the presence of alternative mechanisms for CVA.
Definition
PFO is the persistent patency of a congenital opening or foramen ovale in the interatrial septum, which
normally closes after birth. Notably, PFO is a potential cause of paradoxical embolism leading to CVA.

Patent foramen ovale Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
PFO is reportedly found in approximately 10% of patients undergoing contrast echo.[5] In one autopsy
series, PFOs were reported of 0.2 to 0.5 cm in 29% of patients and 0.6 to 1.0 cm in 6% of patients.[6]
Another study showed an incidence of 27%, with PFOs varying from 1 to 19 mm in size.[7] The incidence
declines with age, suggesting that some PFOs may close anatomically even in adulthood. There is no sex or
age predominance. Epidemiologic studies in large populations suggest some racial and ethnic differences
in incidence, although other studies are unsupporting.[8] [9] Due to increased usage of contrast echo and
availability of percutaneous treatment, PFO is increasingly recognized in the overall population, with higher
numbers in stroke survivors.
Etiology
PFO is idiopathic.
Pathophysiology
The middle segment of the atrial septum is called the fossa ovalis. Often, there is a slit-like opening between
the two parts of the septum called a PFO. In one autopsy series, PFOs were reported of 0.2 to 0.5 cm
in 29% of patients and 0.6 to 1.0 cm in 6% of patients.[6] During normal fetal development, the septum
primum membrane develops from the top of the atrium downward to form part of the early interatrial septum
separating the right and left atria. In PFO, this membrane is incomplete and is called septum primum atrial
septal defect (ASD). A septum secundum occurs when another membrane forms from the bottom of the
atrium upward and to the right of the septum primum. The two septa overlap and form an aberrant atrial
septum, dividing the atria in half.
A PFO is a flap-like communication between the two atria. Because the septum secundum is to the right
of the septum primum, there is no, or very little, left-to-right shunting. Because the pressure in both atria
is generally low, there is very little shunting and the flap may remain closed. However, when the right atrial
pressure rises transiently (e.g., during straining, Valsalva maneuver or coughing) this flap separates and
allows blood to travel from the right atrium to the left atrium. This type of shunting may become more marked
in cases where the right atrial pressure is elevated due to pathology such as pneumonia or pulmonary
embolism. Shunting across a PFO may exacerbate hypoxemia at high altitude.[10] The size of the PFO also
determines the amount of shunting because large defects will increase the allowed flow.[11]
The degree of blood shunting is not enough to be hemodynamically significant except under rare
circumstances. In patients on mechanical ventilators, such aberrant flow may cause persistent hypoxemia. If
a thrombus such as a deep vein thrombosis was to form in the legs and flow to the right atrium, it may travel
through the PFO and enter the systemic circulation, causing a stroke or a peripheral arterial embolism.
Classification
Small versus large PFO[1]
• Small PFO: <10 microbubbles crossing into the left atrium after intravenous injection.

• Large PFO: >10 microbubbles crossing into the left atrium after intravenous injection. Bubbles appear
in the left atrium within three cardiac cycles of injection to exclude the possibility of recirculation
through a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
Septum primum ASD versus septum secundum ASD
• Septum primum ASD: an incomplete membrane formed from the top of the atrium downward
separating the right and left atria.
• Septum secundum ASD: forms from the bottom of the atrium upward and to the right of the septum
primum. The septa overlap and form an aberrant atrial septum, dividing the atria in half.
Case history
Case history #1
A 43-year-old male smoker with no significant past medical history presents with sudden onset of
right-sided weakness of his body. He has no previous history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
or cerebrovascular accident. Physical examination reveals right-sided hemiparesis with expressive
dysphasia. An ECG shows normal sinus rhythm. A head computed tomography shows a cerebral infarct
in the left middle cerebral artery distribution. Carotid ultrasound does not show any significant obstruction.
A transesophageal echo indicates a PFO with a large number of microbubbles crossing into the left atrium
after intravenous injection of agitated saline.
Other presentations
A patient with a PFO may present with a migraine headache. Migraine sufferers have a higher incidence
of PFO and there have been reports of migraine relief following surgical closure.[2] Platypnea-orthodeoxia
syndrome is a rare disorder associated with a PFO. The patient presents with oxygen desaturation and
shortness of breath in the upright position with relief of symptoms when recumbent.[3] PFO may also
manifest as venous-to-arterial gas embolism and some forms of decompression sickness in underwater
divers or astronauts.[4]

DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Clinical examination is not useful in establishing a diagnosis. Echo and, in particular, transesophageal echo
(TEE) form the cornerstone of diagnosis.

History and physical examination
The majority of patients are completely asymptomatic and no abnormal physical findings are associated.
Suspicion of PFO is increased if a patient under 60 years presents with:
• A cryptogenic stroke
• A sudden onset of cold and pain in a limb
• No obvious source of embolism.
A high index of suspicion is more likely to lead to a diagnosis. In patients with other obvious causes of
a stroke, such as atrial fibrillation, aortic disease, or severe carotid artery disease, detection of a PFO
is less useful, as it is unlikely to change management. Due to the presence of multiple variables that
could contribute to an embolic stroke, a multidisciplinary approach - with neurology and cardiology teams
- is warranted to identify patient subsets where the presence of PFO could contribute to the embolic
phenomenon and benefit from PFO closure procedure.

Patients with a decompression syndrome can also present with mild-to-severe manifestation due to the
presence of PFO. Decompression syndrome is most often associated with a change of pressure from
deep sea diving. A similar phenomenon and potential risk with PFO has been reported with high elevation
flying, but it is not a well-established phenomenon.
Rarely, migraine headaches may indicate the presence of PFO.
A history of congenital heart disease (e.g., Ebstein anomaly) increases the likelihood of PFO and a high
index of suspicion is warranted in divers with a history of decompression illness.
Dyspnea associated with postural change (worse when the patient is upright; improves when the patient
is recumbent) may be a clue to a PFO and platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome.
On cardiac examination, splitting of the second heart sound and a systolic murmur (sometimes fixed) are
found in secundum atrial septal defect (ASD).
Echocardiography
Echocardiography is the principal modality used in the comprehensive evaluation of a PFO.[16] A
transthoracic echo, paying careful attention to the interatrial septum, may serve as a screening test in
suspected cases; however, the more invasive TEE is the method of choice. TEE is favored due to the
following factors:
• More sensitive and specific in the detection of a PFO
• Better visualization
• Allows differentiation of a PFO from an ASD
• Decreases the rate of missed PFOs.
TEE is also very useful in the thorough evaluation of a PFO prior to device closure.[17]
Intracardiac echo is reserved for use during percutaneous closure of a PFO due to its high cost and
invasive nature.
Color flow Doppler imaging shows color flow across the small defect in the interatrial septum. This flow is
typically right to left but could sometimes be left to right or bidirectional. Intravenous injection of agitated
saline with provocative maneuvers (e.g., Valsalva and coughing) to increase right atrial pressure is utilized
to evaluate for right to left crossover of microbubbles. Excessive mobility of the interatrial septum or
presence of an atrial septal aneurysm indicates a PFO.

Other imaging modalities
Less commonly utilized, a transcranial Doppler may be performed to diagnose shunting through a
PFO.[18] Although it is sensitive in the detection of abnormal flow, it does not actually visualize the PFO
defect and therefore could produce a false positive.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scanning have not yet been
demonstrated as useful in everyday diagnosis but may serve as important modalities for diagnosing
ASDs. Imaging of the lower extremity with ultrasound or MRI may aid in the diagnosis of deep vein
thrombosis and the overall diagnosis of paradoxical embolism and PFO.
Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome
Diagnosis of platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome is best made by tilt-table TEE. The PFO is established as
causative if an inserted TEE probe shows a significant amount of right-to-left shunting across the PFO
resulting in hypoxemia in an upright position, and if there is a resolution of shunting and hypoxemia when
the patient is in the recumbent position.

History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
atrial septal aneurysm (common)
• A risk factor.
congenital heart conditions (common)
• A risk factor.
cerebrovascular accident (CVA) at ages <60 years (common)
• In order to prove definitively that the PFO is a causal factor, patients have a right-sided thrombus (e.g.,
deep vein thrombosis), presence of PFO, evidence of systemic embolism (e.g., CVA or intra-arterial
embolism) and thrombus crossing through the PFO (thrombus-in-transit).[19]
• It is extremely rare to have all four factors present, and thus the presence of CVA and PFO with an
absence of other obvious sources of embolism is presumptively diagnostic of paradoxical embolism.
• PFO is present in all age groups, but is more likely to be the cause of cryptogenic stroke in younger
patients.
abnormal cardiac examination (common)
• A systolic murmur (sometimes fixed) and splitting of the second heart sound is found in secundum
atrial septal defect.
deep vein thrombosis (uncommon)
• Increases the likelihood of paradoxical embolism in patients with a PFO.
Other diagnostic factors
decompression symptoms related to diving (uncommon)
• Venous to arterial gas embolism is seen in some divers as part of decompression from coming to the
ocean surface while deep sea diving.
cold sensation in limb (uncommon)
• May be evidence of systemic embolism (e.g., CVA or intra-arterial embolism).
limb pain (uncommon)
• May be evidence of systemic embolism (e.g., CVA or intra-arterial embolism).
shortness of breath while upright in platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome
(uncommon)
• In platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome, patients usually experience shortness of breath upon sitting and
relief upon assuming a recumbent position.

Patent foramen ovale Management
Approach
Most asymptomatic people may be observed without the need for treatment.
For patients aged younger than 60 years with cryptogenic stroke, percutaneous closure of PFO with
antiplatelet therapy is recommended to decrease the risk of future ischemic events. For such patients who
have indications for chronic anticoagulation, PFO device closure is not recommended.
Evidence for PFO closure in patients older than 60 years, with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, is not as
strong.
Guidelines support a multidisciplinary approach with involvement of neurology and cardiology teams, along
with shared decision making with the patient, in formulating a management plan.[22][23] Various stroke
guidelines offer guidance on management approach to patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO; these
should be referred to in formulating a management plan for these patients.[22][23][24] [25]
It is unclear whether patients with recurrent migraine headaches or decompression sickness would benefit
from routine evaluation and closure of their PFO.
Asymptomatic patients with low embolism risk (not in high-risk
occupation)
Some PFOs are detected as an incidental finding on echo. The size of the defect and the number
of microbubbles crossing into the left atrium seem to define relative risk. A small number of
microbubbles (<10) crossing over generally indicates a small defect and is associated with a lower risk
of thromboembolism. However, the number of microbubbles crossing over can be variable depending on
certain factors. Factors that may increase the number of bubbles seen to cross are injection through a
lower limb vein instead of an upper limb vein, and evaluation during Valsalva or coughing. The number of
bubbles may also be somewhat influenced by the density of microbubbles in the injectate.
In asymptomatic patients judged to have a low embolism risk, conservative treatment comprising patient
education and short-term observation for any evidence of a paradoxical embolism is usually sufficient.
Asymptomatic patients with high risk of thrombotic event (not in
high-risk occupation)
Individual assessment of risk is recommended. Clinical observation may be appropriate care in selected
patients. There is some evidence to suggest that larger PFO defects and associated atrial septal
aneurysms carry a higher risk of cerebrovascular accident.[26] [27]
Initiation of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel may be considered and referral to an
appropriate specialist is also recommended. Anticoagulation with warfarin is less commonly
recommended, but may be considered. There are no clear guidelines on combined usage, although a
combination is often used in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease.
Cryptogenic stroke
For the management of patients with non-lacunar cryptogenic stroke and PFO, a multidisciplinary
approach is warranted to evaluate for cryptogenic stroke and the probability of PFO as a contributing
factor for the event. Workup includes evaluation for atrial fibrillation, aortic or cerebrovascular disease,
and left heart disease.

Patent foramen ovale Management
MANAGEMENT
In patients ages 18 to 60 years with established cryptogenic stroke and presence of PFO, it is reasonable
to proceed with a percutaneous transcatheter PFO closure procedure along with postoperative antiplatelet
therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic events, rather than antiplatelet therapy alone.[25] The benefit
with PFO closure appears stronger in patients with high-risk features (i.e., large PFO, atrial septal
aneurysm).[22] 
In patients with low-risk anatomic features of PFO, further risk stratification using the risk of paradoxical
embolism (RoPE) score might be beneficial in identifying patients with PFO-related cryptogenic stroke.
Factors in the score indicative of a higher likelihood of a PFO-related stroke are the absence of traditional
risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, cortical infarct on imaging, and
younger age.[28] Prior to percutaneous closure, patients receive antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation.
After PFO closure, antiplatelet therapy is typically recommended. For patients who have indications for
chronic anticoagulation, PFO device closure is not indicated. 
The PFO procedure is associated with a benefit of an absolute recurrent stroke risk reduction of 3.4% at
5 years, with a periprocedural complication risk of 3.9% and increased absolute rate of nonperiprocedural
atrial fibrillation of 0.33% per year.[28]
Evidence is not as strong for PFO closure in patients younger than 18 years or older than 60 years with
multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Guidelines support a multidisciplinary approach with involvement
of neurology and cardiology teams, along with shared decision making with the patient, in formulating a
management plan.[22][23] 
For patients with cryptogenic stroke, who are not a candidate for a PFO closure procedure, medical
therapy with full anticoagulation is preferred over antiplatelet therapy to decrease recurrent ischemic
events. This approach is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. Careful evaluation of the
bleeding profile of the patient and shared decision making is recommended in selecting antiplatelet
versus anticoagulation therapy.[25]
Similarly, in patients with planned long-term anticoagulation, an additional benefit of PFO closure for
reducing ischemic events is not established.
High-risk occupation
In patients involved in a high-risk profession (e.g., an astronaut, deep sea diver, or high altitude pilot),
treatment with antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy is generally recommended, along with behavioral
prevention of decompression sickness.[29] Percutaneous closure of the PFO should be considered on
an individual basis for scuba divers who have symptoms of decompression sickness.[30] It is unknown
whether astronauts need to undergo closure.
Open surgery is used if the PFO is discovered during open heart surgery for another indication such as
bypass or valvular surgery.
A permanently deployed double-umbrella device occluding the PFO is deployed through venous access
across the interatrial septum. One of the device limbs is deployed in the left atrium with the other in the
right atrium. Currently available devices include the Amplatzer (AGA) PFO occluder, the Starflex (NMT
Medical) device, Premere (St. Jude), PFO STAR (Cardia), and Helex (Gore).
These devices are introduced through a vein, typically a femoral vein. The device is then advanced in a
collapsed state through a sheath placed across the interatrial septum. The sheath is gradually withdrawn
and the left atrial side of the device self-expands. The whole apparatus is pulled back until the left atrial

side of the device pulls against the septum. The sheath is then further pulled back to expose the right
atrial disk, which also self-expands. Once proper positioning is confirmed by x-ray and ultrasound, the
device catheter shaft is detached or unscrewed from the device and withdrawn from the body, leaving
the device behind. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Amplatzer PFO Occluder in
2016 and the Gore Cardioform Septal Occluder in 2018 for PFO closure in the US 'to reduce the risk of
recurrent ischemic stroke in patients, predominantly between the ages of 18 and 60 years, who have
had a cryptogenic stroke due to a presumed paradoxical embolism, as determined by a neurologist and
cardiologist following an evaluation to exclude known causes of ischemic stroke.'
Calls for randomized trial data comparing medical treatment versus device treatment had met with
poor enrollment responses.[31] One review of observational studies has suggested benefits of device
closure, but the results of the randomized CLOSURE 1 study of >900 patients failed to show a difference
in end points between best medical therapy and device closure.[32] [33] However, device safety was
demonstrated. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed no difference in medical therapy versus
closure with an Amplatzer device.[34] Both the CLOSURE 1 study and the RCT trial did not achieve the
prespecified clinical end point for efficacy and showed nonstatistically significant trends toward benefit
with a closure device group for secondary stroke prevention compared with antiplatelet or anticoagulant
therapy. Observational studies suggest that anticoagulant therapy may be better than antiplatelet therapy
in medically treated patients.[33] Subsequent trials CLOSE and REDUCE compared the efficacy of
a closure device to antiplatelet therapy alone and showed significant benefit with closure device use.
The DEFENSE PRO trial evaluated the benefit of a closure device in patients with PFO with high-
risk features (e.g., large shunt size and atrial septal aneurysm) and did not restrict medical therapy to
antiplatelet therapy alone. The results were overwhelmingly positive, favoring the closure device arm.
One subsequent meta-analysis of all the RCTs by the American Association of Neurology showed that in
patients younger than 60 years with cryptogenic stroke, the PFO procedure is associated with a benefit
of an absolute recurrent stroke risk reduction of 3.4% at 5 years, with a periprocedural complication risk
of 3.9% and increased absolute rate of nonperiprocedural atrial fibrillation of 0.33% per year.[28] When
compared to a similar strategy with anticoagulation therapy, there was no difference in the reduction of
ischemic events but there was an associated decrease in bleeding events with the device closure plan.
When full anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies were compared, without a closure device, there was
a decrease in ischemic events with full anticoagulation but with an associated increase in major bleeding
events.[25]

1st education and observation
» Patients with a small PFO and without a prior
history of cerebrovascular accident do not
require intervention. These patients are without
an atrial septal aneurysm or have crossover
of very few (<10) microbubbles on contrast
injection. The PFO is generally an incidental
finding. There is a low risk of paradoxical

favor treatment. Education and observation for
any evidence of a paradoxical embolism is all
that is required.
asymptomatic with high risk of
thrombotic event (not in high-risk

1st observation
» Factors denoting high risk of thrombosis are
large PFOs with a large number of microbubble
crossovers and/or an associated atrial septal

» Initiation of antiplatelet therapy should be
considered, especially in patients with larger
PFO defects and associated atrial septal

» Usual recommendation is aspirin or clopidogrel
rather than warfarin, unless anticoagulation
is indicated. There are no clear guidelines on

percutaneous closure
1st percutaneous closure
» In patients ages 18 to 60 years with
established cryptogenic stroke and presence
of PFO, it is reasonable to proceed with a
percutaneous transcatheter PFO closure
procedure along with postoperative antiplatelet
therapy to prevent recurrent ischemic events,
rather than antiplatelet therapy alone.[25] 
» The benefit with PFO closure appears stronger
in patients with high-risk features (i.e., large
PFO, atrial septal aneurysm).[22] 
» In patients with low-risk anatomic features
of PFO, further risk stratification using the risk
of paradoxical embolism (RoPE) score might
be beneficial in identifying patients with PFO-
related cryptogenic stroke. Factors in the score
indicative of a higher likelihood of a PFO-related
stroke are the absence of traditional risk factors
such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, prior
stroke, cortical infarct on imaging, and younger
age.[28]
» Prior to percutaneous closure, patients
receive antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation.
After PFO closure, antiplatelet therapy is
typically recommended. For patients who have
indications for chronic anticoagulation, PFO
device closure is not indicated.
» The PFO procedure is associated with
a benefit of an absolute recurrent stroke

» Percutaneous closure of the PFO should
be considered on an individual basis for
professional scuba divers in whom behavioral
prevention methods are not effective in
preventing symptoms of decompression
sickness.[30] It is unknown whether astronauts
need to undergo closure. 
» Open surgery is used if the PFO is discovered
during open heart surgery for another indication
such as bypass or valvular surgery.
» Prior to percutaneous closure, patients
receive antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation.
After PFO closure, antiplatelet therapy is
typically recommended. For patients who have
indications for chronic anticoagulation, PFO
device closure is not indicated.
Secondary prevention
Deep venous thrombosis prevention is helped by improving mobility, especially postoperatively. Measures
such as leg exercises and use of anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin, or mechanical
measures such as calf compression should be considered. Additionally, in people known to have a PFO,
maneuvers that lead to increased right atrial pressure (i.e., straining and Valsalva) should be avoided to
prevent paradoxical embolism. Compliance with prescribed medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or
warfarin is essential, as these decrease the chances of a recurrent event.

Patient discussions
Patients should be instructed on recognition of:
• Symptoms and signs of peripheral arterial embolism (i.e., sudden onset of pain, pallor and loss of
function in an extremity)
• Symptoms and signs of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (i.e., sudden onset of weakness in one
part of the body and sudden visual or speech disturbance)
• Symptoms and signs of deep venous thrombosis.
The importance of urgent CVA treatment should be stressed, as early treatment can result in significant
reduction of neurologic damage and improved long-term outlook.

Monitoring
Monitoring
No long-term monitoring is recommended for small, asymptomatic PFO. Routine clinical follow-up of
patients with cerebrovascular accident is recommended. In patients who have undergone PFO closure,
follow-up echo (with injection of intravenous agitated saline) is recommended at approximately 6 months
after closure. This will help to confirm adequate closure of the PFO and determine the continuation or
discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
hypoxemia short term low
Patients who suffer from an acute illness resulting in temporary elevation of right heart pressures (e.g.,
acute PE, pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation) may experience right-to-left shunting of blood across
the PFO, resulting in persistent hypoxemia.
Patients on mechanical ventilation may have difficulty weaning from oxygen supply as they often remain
hypoxemic.
residual shunt after PFO closure short term low
Incomplete closure may be treated with observation.
Published reports show use of an additional device to close residual defects.[42]
thrombus on closure device short term low
There are case reports of thrombus forming on the closure device, which can be complicated by embolic
phenomenon.[43] [44]
cardiac perforation from device deployment short term low
An extremely rare complication of device deployment that requires surgical intervention.
cardiac tamponade from device deployment short term low
An extremely rare complication of device deployment that requires surgical intervention.
cardiac arrhythmia short term low
PFO closure with antiplatelet therapy increases the absolute risk of persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter by
1.8% and transient atrial fibrillation or flutter by 1.2% at 1 year.[25]
air embolism short term low
An extremely rare complication of device deployment.
embolization of closure device short term low
An extremely rare complication of device deployment.[44]
migraine long term low
Evidence suggests migraines are more frequent in patients with PFO and anecdotal evidence suggests
improvement in headache symptoms after closure.[2] [14]
In a patient with frequent, disabling migraines despite medications, closure of a PFO may be considered.

Patent foramen ovale Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
Although percutaneous closure is relatively safe, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend closure
due to migraines.
Further evidence is likely to emerge with ongoing studies.
PFO closure in one UK study failed to achieve its primary end point of eliminating migraine headaches in
40% of subjects. However, significant reduction in migraine headache burden did occur.[41]
recurrent stroke after percutaneous closure of foramen
ovale
long term low
There is a low but not negligible rate of recurrent stroke despite percutaneous closure.
This may be due to mechanisms independent of a PFO or device, incomplete closure or thrombus
formation on the device.[38] [39]
erosion from closure device long term low
An extremely rare complication of device deployment.[44]
ischemic stroke variable low
Paradoxical embolism occurs through a PFO.
An evaluation by the multidisciplinary team is recommended to determine management options for the
patient, including PFO closure with medical therapy or medical therapy alone.
Certain prothrombotic mutations such as factor V Leiden (FV[G1691A] mutation) and the prothrombin
mutation (PT[G20210A] mutation) have been suggested as increasing risk of cerebral ischemia in patients
with PFO.[40]
transient ischemic attack (TIA) variable low
Paradoxical embolism occurs through a PFO.
The majority of clinical trials for PFO closure did not include TIA in the inclusion criteria. Careful
multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended to determine the management plan for the patients.[22] [23]
 Initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy is recommended, depending on the patient’s specific
factors. 
Prognosis
All patients
PFO is not associated with higher risk of recurrent stroke or death in medically treated patients. However, in
patients ages under 60 years with PFO and atrial septal aneurysm, the risk of recurrent stroke is higher.

Asymptomatic with small defect
PFO is a very common and often incidental finding with an excellent prognosis. No formal studies are
available.
Large PFO and previous stroke
Risk of recurrent stroke with no other obvious cause is three times higher in patients with PFO and six times
higher in patients with PFO and atrial septal aneurysm (3% per year).[12] [36] [37] 
After percutaneous closure
Risk of recurrent stroke is low but not negligible.[38] [39]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
