Carotid artery stenosis Overview
Summary
Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the lumen of the carotid artery. Approximately 10% to 15% of all
ischemic strokes are associated with carotid artery stenosis.
Atherosclerotic plaque in the cervical carotid artery is the most common cause. Plaque disruption and
atheroembolization into the intracranial circulation is the most common mechanism for stroke.
The majority of carotid artery stenoses are mild or moderate, and asymptomatic.
Duplex ultrasonography is a commonly used mode of diagnosis; computed tomography angiography or
magnetic resonance angiography are alternatives that also help to define the anatomy if intervention is
indicated.
Most patients with carotid artery stenosis should receive antiplatelet therapy, and all should receive risk factor
modification.
Carotid revascularization of moderate- or high-grade recently symptomatic carotid artery stenosis prevents
future stroke.
The benefit of revascularization for asymptomatic stenosis is less certain.
Definition
Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the lumen of the carotid artery. Atherosclerotic plaque in the
cervical carotid artery is the most common cause. The unique hemodynamics at the carotid bifurcation
predisposes this area to atherosclerosis. The majority of patients have mild- or moderate-sized plaques,
while some develop high-grade stenosis. A small percentage of plaques may rupture and embolize to
occlude intracranial arteries, causing a transient ischemic attack or stroke, or occlude retinal arteries to
cause transient monocular blindness (amaurosis fugax) or retinal strokes.

Carotid artery stenosis Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
One systematic review and meta-analysis estimated the global prevalence of carotid stenosis in people ages
30-79 years in 2020 to be 1.5%.[3] The estimated global prevalences of increased carotid intima-media
thickness and carotid plaque were 27.6% and 21.1%, respectively.[3] Compared with the year 2000, the
prevalence of carotid stenosis had increased by 59.13%, with the greatest increase in those ages 50-59
years. The prevalence of carotid stenosis, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and carotid plaque
increased with older age, and was higher in men than in women. In another systematic review, asymptomatic
carotid artery stenosis was estimated to affect approximately 7% of women and 12% of men ages >70
years.[4] In a study in the US, high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis (≥70% stenosis) was found to occur
in approximately 1.0% of men and 0.6% of women ages 75 years and over.[5]
Approximately 10% to 15% of all ischemic strokes are associated with carotid artery stenosis, and carotid-
related strokes are commonly disabling or fatal. About one third of strokes are thromboembolic in etiology,
and atherosclerotic carotid stenosis is the most common single cause.[6]
In the Northern Manhattan Study, between 1993 and 1996, stroke attributable to carotid stenosis occurred
in 17 in 100,000 (95% CI 8 to 26) black people, 9 in 100,000 (95% CI 5 to 13) Hispanic people, and 5 in
100,000 (95% CI 2 to 8) white people.[7] 
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. In the US, each year
approximately 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke, with 610,000 of these being first attacks
and 185,000 recurrent attacks.[8] In 2021, 162,890 deaths were attributable to stroke.[8] 
Etiology
The most common cause of carotid artery stenosis is atherosclerotic plaque in the cervical carotid artery.
The unique hemodynamics at the carotid bifurcation predisposes this area to atherosclerosis. A small
percentage of plaques may rupture and embolize to occlude intracranial arteries (causing a transient
ischemic attack or stroke) or occlude retinal arteries (to cause transient monocular blindness or retinal
strokes). Other less common causes include radiation arteritis, spontaneous or traumatic dissection,
fibromuscular dysplasia, and restenosis after prior carotid artery revascularization.
Pathophysiology
Histologic evaluation of atherosclerotic plaques has demonstrated that they originate from fatty streaks
that, over time, accumulate into a lipid core. The fatty streak becomes a fibroatheroma as fibrous tissue
accumulates over the core and forms a fibrous cap. Through unknown mechanisms, some plaques become
unstable resulting in an enlarging lipid core, intraplaque hemorrhage, plaque enlargement, thinning of the
fibrous cap, fibrous cap rupture, ulceration, and luminal thrombosis.[9] These histomorphologic features
have been associated with the production of atheroemboli and neurologic symptoms. These features have
frequently been observed in explanted plaque specimens obtained from symptomatic patients.

From the personal collection of Brajesh K. Lal, MD
 Duplex ultrasound and recent advances in computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic
resonance imaging allow more detailed characterization of plaques. This has the potential for defining high-
risk lesions in the future.
The unique hemodynamics at the carotid bifurcation predispose this area to atherosclerosis. Along the inner
wall of the carotid bulb, blood flow remains laminar, with high velocity and high shear stress. Conversely,
along the outer wall there are areas of flow separation, stasis, turbulent flow, and a complex oscillating shear
stress pattern that predispose to atherosclerotic plaque deposition.[10]
Although rare neurologic events have been attributed to progressive stenosis and decreased blood flow from
enlarging atherosclerotic plaques, most such events are secondary to plaque rupture with superimposed
thrombosis and then embolization of thrombus from the lesion. Localized thrombosis can also lead to
occlusion of the artery. Disruption of the fibrous cap with exposure of atherosclerotic debris to the flow
lumen and embolization of cholesterol laden debris appears to be responsible for some embolic symptoms.
Additional factors such as low cerebral perfusion pressure and poor collateralization, plaque ulceration or
hemorrhage, hypotension, or a low cardiac output may also play a contributory role.

Case history
Case history #1
A 72-year-old man presents with sudden onset of left arm weakness and numbness. He is being treated
for hypertension and diabetes, and smokes 20 cigarettes per day. He has undergone coronary artery
stenting subsequent to a myocardial infarction 2 years ago. He has a regular heart rhythm. Duplex
ultrasonography is consistent with a >80% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Contrast-enhanced
computed tomography demonstrates a right frontoparietal infarction without evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage.
Case history #2
A 62-year-old woman presents for a routine annual evaluation to her primary care physician. She is being
treated for hypertension and diabetes. She smokes 20 cigarettes per day. She has undergone coronary
artery bypass grafting subsequent to unstable angina 2 years ago. She does not recollect an episode of
sensory or motor deficit or of monocular blindness. She has a regular heart rhythm with a loud systolic
bruit audible over her right neck. She has no demonstrable motor or sensory deficits on physical exam.
Duplex ultrasonography is consistent with a 50% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
Other presentations
Typically, eye symptoms from carotid atheroembolization include transient monocular blindness or
amaurosis fugax (temporary loss of vision in the ipsilateral eye, typically described as a curtain or shade
falling over the eye), central retinal artery occlusion, or branch retinal artery occlusion (which may be
asymptomatic and detected during retinal screening). Atypical eye symptoms include: homonymous
hemianopia (resulting from emboli to optic radiation), intermittent retinal blindness with loss of vision

on exposure to bright light, neovascularization of iris (resulting from ophthalmic artery ischemia), and,
rarely, complete blindness (resulting from ischemic optic neuropathy). Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)
of temporary loss of sensory, motor, or visual function typically last for <60 minutes and always return to
baseline within 24 hours. Patients may have recurring attacks of TIA within a few days and the deficit may
last longer with each attack. These symptoms are associated with a worse outcome and are referred to as
crescendo TIAs. Finally, patients may also present with recurring attacks of focal neurologic deficits with
progressive deterioration in neurologic function. This is termed a stroke in evolution and generally lasts
>24 hours.

Carotid artery stenosis Diagnosis
Approach
Carotid artery stenosis is the most common preventable cause of stroke. Because one of the major goals
of management is the prevention of stroke, the identification of individuals with carotid stenosis is an
important objective. In the presence of neurologic symptoms, the focus is on preventing a recurrent stroke
or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In view of its low cost, ready availability, and relative accuracy, carotid
duplex ultrasonography is the mainstay of screening, initial imaging, and, in some instances, is the only
imaging modality utilized for the workup of carotid stenosis. However, with the emergence of mechanical
thrombectomy as a treatment option for acute stroke, detailed evaluation of the extra- and intracranial
vasculature is becoming more routine in patients presenting with strokes. Hence, contrast-enhanced
computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are increasingly
used alternatives and have the advantage of imaging the full length of the carotid arteries. Other important
considerations in the diagnosis include determining the degree of stenosis and assessing the presence of
ischemic injury to the brain.
History and physical exam
Most people with carotid artery stenosis are asymptomatic. The most frequent reason for suspecting the
diagnosis is the presence of atherosclerotic high-risk factors. However, even though a cervical bruit is not
a sensitive or specific sign (it is associated with carotid artery stenosis of any severity in 47% of patients),
its presence often prompts evaluation for the condition.[17]
High-risk factors include:[11]
• peripheral arterial occlusive disease
• coronary artery bypass surgery
• ages ≥55 years with at least two traditional atherosclerotic risk factors
• hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease
• ages ≥55 years with active smoking
• clinically occult cerebral infarction noted on imaging studies.
The patient should be assessed for the presence of focal neurologic deficits. The presence of deficits
(e.g., sudden onset of visual loss or visual field deficit, weakness, aphasia, altered sensation, or
dysarthria) lasting >24 hours indicates ischemic stroke. Stereotypic and temporary loss of sensory, motor,
or visual function that lasts for <24 hours indicates a TIA.
Patients may present with a variety of visual symptoms, such as transient monocular blindness
(amaurosis fugax or temporary loss of vision in the ipsilateral eye), homonymous hemianopia (decrease in
visual field from emboli to the optic radiation), intermittent retinal blindness with loss of vision on exposure
to bright light, neovascularization of iris (resulting from ophthalmic artery ischemia), and, rarely, complete
blindness (resulting from ischemic optic neuropathy).
Screening of the asymptomatic patient
Duplex ultrasonography can be used for identifying patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.[11] [18]

The low prevalence of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in the general population means that indiscriminate
screening of all adults does not reduce the risk of stroke, and it is therefore not recommended.[11] [19]
 Patients with at least one high-risk factor may be considered for imaging; however, this is controversial.  
The presence of a bruit is associated with carotid artery stenosis of any severity in 47% of patients;
however, a clinically high-grade stenosis is found in only <2% of individuals with a bruit.[17] [20]
Therefore, indiscriminate imaging of all patients with a bruit has not generally been recommended by
guidelines, although it may be considered if there are other associated risk factors for stenosis.[11]
Investigations
Duplex ultrasonography, CTA, or MRA should be ordered when carotid artery stenosis is suspected in
either an asymptomatic or symptomatic patient in whom intervention might be considered (or treatment
modified). The most frequent reason for suspecting the diagnosis in an asymptomatic patient is the
presence of atherosclerotic high-risk factors.[11] One study found that duplex ultrasonography will
identify a ≥70% degree of stenosis with a sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, and an overall accuracy
of 95%.[21] The other modalities have similar accuracy.[22] One Cochrane review evaluating duplex
ultrasound for diagnosis of symptomatic carotid stenosis found that it was accurate at discriminating
between the presence or absence of significant carotid artery stenosis (<50% or 50% to 99%).[23]
Once it has been established that a stenosis is present in the cervical carotid artery, the next focus is
to determine the degree of stenosis. The majority of carotid stenoses are either mild (<50% diameter

reduction) or moderate (50% to 69% diameter reduction). Lesion severity has an important role in
determination of the type of potential therapy for the patient and prognosis. Quantification is usually
performed using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria,
whereby the diameter of the arterial lumen at the tightest region of stenosis is compared with the region of
the distal internal carotid artery that is free of disease and has nontapering walls.[24] These criteria have
become accepted worldwide and other criteria are rarely used.
The formula used to calculate the degree of stenosis is:
Percentage stenosis = [1 - (minimum diameter/distal diameter)] × 100
Ultrasonography also identifies the anatomy, status of the contralateral carotid, collateral flow, and
possible differential diagnoses.[25] CTA and MRA have the advantage of also identifying other lesions
within the carotid and vertebral circulation. 
 When duplex ultrasonography is nondiagnostic, or more information is required on the vessels proximal
or distal to the cervical carotid artery, CTA or MRA are appropriate alternatives.[2] [11] These tests should
be ordered when the results of duplex ultrasonography are equivocal, or fall in the moderate (50% to
69% diameter reduction) stenosis range, which is at the threshold where carotid artery revascularization
may be necessary. They should also be ordered when there is a need to evaluate the arterial anatomy
proximal and distal to the cervical carotid artery, or to view the aortic arch before carotid stenting. CTA
is performed more commonly compared with MRA, but MRA is preferred in some institutions with
specialized capability. CTA is the best modality to determine the degree of stenosis. This is important
when determining whether the patient is a candidate for carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy.
MRA has a tendency to overestimate stenosis severity.
In symptomatic patients, appropriate assessment of ischemic brain injury is best accomplished
with cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography if MRI is unavailable or
contraindicated.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
asymptomatic (common)
• Many people with carotid stenosis have no signs or symptoms.
• The most frequent reason for suspecting the diagnosis is the presence of atherosclerotic high-risk
factors (i.e., patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease, coronary artery occlusive disease,
hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or ages ≥55 years with active smoking).[11]
cervical bruit (uncommon)
• Not a sensitive or specific sign; however, its presence often prompts evaluation for the condition.
• Although the presence of a bruit is associated with a carotid stenosis of any severity in 47% of
patients, a clinically high-grade stenosis is found in only <2% of individuals with a bruit.[17] [20]

DIAGNOSIS
focal neurologic deficit lasting >24 hours (i.e., stroke) (uncommon)
• Ischemic stroke most commonly presents with sudden onset of visual loss or visual field deficit,
weakness, aphasia, altered sensation, or dysarthria.
• Carotid stenosis predisposes to watershed infarction in the border zones between the main arterial
territories of the brain where cerebral perfusion pressure is lowest.[25]
focal neurologic deficit lasting <24 hours (i.e., transient ischemic attack
[TIA]) (uncommon)
• Stereotypic and temporary loss of sensory/motor/visual function with return to baseline at the end of an
attack. The deficit generally lasts for <60 minutes, but may last up to 24 hours. High-grade stenoses
may also cause repetitive, very brief TIAs lasting <1 minute.[25]
• In people who have had a stroke attributable to carotid disease, a history of TIA can be elicited in at
least half.[25]
Other diagnostic factors
transient visual symptoms (uncommon)
• Patients may present with a variety of visual symptoms, such as transient monocular blindness
(amaurosis fugax, temporary loss of vision in the ipsilateral eye), homonymous hemianopia (decrease
in visual field from emboli to the optic radiation), intermittent retinal blindness with loss of vision on
exposure to bright light, neovascularization of iris (resulting from ophthalmic artery ischemia), and,
rarely, complete blindness (resulting from ischemic optic neuropathy). Asymptomatic retinal artery
emboli may be noted on fundoscopy or during retinal screening for diabetic eye disease, and these
commonly arise from an ipsilateral carotid stenosis.
Risk factors
Strong
older age
• Age is the single most important risk factor for stroke and also increases the risk for carotid artery
stenosis.[11] For each successive 10 years after the age of 55 years, the stroke rate doubles.[12]
• Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis affects approximately 7% of women and 12% of men >70 years
of age.[4]
smoking
• Smoking is an independent predictor of carotid artery stenosis.[3] [11][13]
• Smokers may have a 50% increased risk for atheroembolic stroke compared with nonsmokers.[14]
history of cardiovascular disease
• The prevalence of high-grade carotid artery stenosis among patients with symptomatic peripheral
vascular disease or significant coronary artery disease warranting an intervention is approximately
20%, regardless of the patient's age.[11][15]

2.9 in women.[16]

information about the stroke lesion compared with CT and can
also identify intracranial hemorrhage. It is more sensitive to recent
ischemia and previous hemorrhage than CT. In patients with recent
stroke, special protocols can visualize changes as early as a few
minutes after the event.

Carotid artery stenosis Diagnosis
The test allows stratification of the degree of carotid artery stenosis on the basis of grayscale and Doppler
velocity results into the following strata: normal (no stenosis), <50% stenosis, 50% to 69% stenosis, 70% to
79% stenosis, 80% to 99% stenosis, near-occlusion (string sign), and total occlusion.[21] [27]
While velocity criteria have been published for additional categories of stenosis, the key purpose of defining
patients with ≥50% stenosis is to identify symptomatic patients who may benefit from revascularization.
North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial
(NASCET) criteria[24]
The diameter of the arterial lumen at the tightest region of stenosis is compared with the region of the
distal internal carotid artery that is free of disease and has nontapering walls. These criteria have become
accepted worldwide and other criteria are rarely used. The formula used to calculate the degree of stenosis
is:
Percentage stenosis = [1 - (minimum diameter/distal diameter)] × 100.
European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) criteria[28]
The diameter of the arterial lumen at the tightest region of stenosis is compared with the estimated normal
lumen diameter at the site of the lesion, based on a visual impression of where the normal arterial wall was
before development of the stenosis. The formula used to calculate the degree of stenosis is:
Percentage stenosis = [1 - (minimum diameter/estimated normal diameter)] × 100.
Relationship between NASCET and ECST criteria[29]
It is critical that physicians treating carotid disease must specify which methodology was used to arrive at the
estimation of stenosis. The degree of stenosis is now usually calculated according to the NASCET criteria,
although the ECST criteria may also be used.
The NASCET and ECST estimates of stenosis have a high degree of correlation, but are not numerically
similar.[29] A 70% stenosis calculated according to the NASCET criteria corresponds to an 82% stenosis
according to the ECST criteria. The NASCET method routinely provides a lower percent stenosis than the
ECST method, a relationship that is best defined by the following equation:
ECST % stenosis = 0.6 (NASCET % stenosis) + 40%.
Screening
Duplex ultrasonography is often used for identifying patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis
when clinically indicated.[11][18] The low prevalence of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in the general
population means that indiscriminate screening of all adults does not reduce the risk of stroke, and is
not recommended.[2] [11] [19] Patients with risk factors may be considered for screening, but this is
controversial. Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines suggest screening patients at increased risk of carotid
stenosis, especially if they are willing to consider carotid intervention if significant stenosis is found.[11]
European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend considering selective screening in patients
with two or more risk factors, with the aim of optimizing risk factor control and medical therapy.[2]

DIAGNOSIS
The presence of a bruit is associated with carotid artery stenosis of any severity in 47% of patients; however,
a clinically high-grade stenosis is found in only <2% of individuals with a bruit.[17] Therefore, indiscriminate
imaging of all patients with a bruit has not generally been recommended by guidelines, although it may be
considered if there are other associated risk factors for stenosis.[11]

Carotid artery stenosis Management
Approach
Carotid artery stenosis is the most common disorder affecting the extracranial carotid artery. Management of
the stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention. It is one of the most intensively studied vascular diseases
and debated by multiple medical specialists since the introduction of carotid endarterectomy as a therapeutic
option more than 70 years ago. Since then, carotid artery stenting was introduced as an endovascular
alternative to carotid endarterectomy, and pharmacologic therapy for stroke prevention has also evolved.
Several randomized controlled trials performed within the past 3 decades form the basis for current treatment
recommendations involving the three components of therapy (pharmacologic, carotid endarterectomy, and
carotid artery stenting).
Ongoing trials in the US (CREST-2) and Europe (ACTRIS) and the recently completed ECST-2 (European
Carotid Surgery Trial 2) compare carotid intervention with intensive medical management, which may result
in updates to treatment recommendations in the next few years.  [CREST-2: The carotid revascularization
and medical management for asymptomatic carotid stenosis study: health and hope for patients at risk
for stroke] (https://www.crest2trial.org/)   [ClinicalTrials.gov: Endarterectomy combined with OMT vs OMT
alone in patients with asymptomatic severe atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis at higher-than-average
risk of ipsilateral stroke] (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02841098)   [European Carotid Surgery Trial 2
(ECST-2)] (http://s489637516.websitehome.co.uk/ECST2/index2.htm)
The current treatment approach is broadly based on the clinical presentation (asymptomatic versus
symptomatic) and may be further modified based on uncommon presentations or etiologies of stenosis.
The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria are accepted worldwide
for calculating the degree of stenosis and other criteria are rarely used. The NASCET criteria are used to
define the degree of stenosis in this section.
Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis
Although previous trials have consistently shown a moderate benefit from revascularization surgery
for asymptomatic stenosis, advances in medical therapy now question the absolute benefit from
revascularization for asymptomatic stenosis.
Pharmacotherapy is, therefore, the first-line therapy in asymptomatic patients. Aspirin is the preferred
antiplatelet agent because of its known benefits in preventing myocardial infarction (MI) in vascular
patients. In the presence of a contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel is a reasonable alternative; other
antiplatelet agents (e.g., dipyridamole) may be considered if neither aspirin or clopidogrel can be used,
depending on availability.[2] Patients on anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin) for an unrelated indication should
not be given antiplatelet agents for carotid stenosis except in special circumstances (e.g., presence of
a stent), and should continue on the anticoagulant with the additional goal of preventing atheroembolic
stroke.[1][31]
The selection of asymptomatic patients for carotid revascularization should be guided by the severity
of stenosis, and an assessment of the patient's comorbid conditions, life expectancy, surgeon-specific
outcomes, and preferences of the patient concerning intervention.
The 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines and 2011 multisociety guidelines recommend carotid
endarterectomy, in addition to the pharmacologic treatment listed, for patients with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis ≥70% if the risk of perioperative stroke, MI, and death is low.[1] [11] The 2023 European Society
for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend that carotid endarterectomy should be considered in patients

with asymptomatic stenosis ≥60% to 99% and an increased risk of late stroke, provided perioperative
stroke/death rates are low (≤3%) and patient life expectancy exceeds 5 years, and if there are particular
features suggesting an increased stroke risk.[2]
Antiplatelet therapy should be started preoperatively to reduce the risk of complications such as stroke
and MI. It should be initiated at diagnosis and continued indefinitely after the procedure.
Results from the CREST and ASCT-2 trials found that both stenting and endarterectomy had a similar
low risk of complications and are similarly effective in reducing the risk of stroke.[32] [33] It is therefore
reasonable to perform carotid artery stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy when the patient is
considered to be high risk for surgery.[1] [2] [34] One meta-analysis of 7118 patients with asymptomatic
carotid artery stenosis from seven randomized controlled trials compared carotid endarterectomy
with carotid artery stenting. There was no significant difference between groups for the perioperative
outcomes of stroke, death, or MI. However, carotid artery stenting was associated with a heightened risk
of perioperative nondisabling stroke but not of perioperative disabling stroke or death, underscoring the
nuanced considerations in treatment selection for this patient population.[35] This approach may differ in
other countries. For example, in the UK, stenting in asymptomatic patients is only recommended within
randomized controlled trials.[36] Dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) is preferred in
patients with stents and is used for at least 4 weeks after stenting, followed by antiplatelet monotherapy
indefinitely.[2]
As plaques within the carotid bulb enlarge and the overlying fibrin cap is eroded, ulcerations may appear
over the surface. This becomes a source of atheroemboli to the retina and cerebral cortex. The majority
of large ulcerations occur in association with high-grade stenoses and will warrant carotid endarterectomy
on the basis of the degree of stenosis.
Asymptomatic patients with large ulcers in the presence of <50% stenosis form a therapeutic dilemma.
These conditions are possible indications for carotid endarterectomy, but the recommendation is based on
weak evidence, and such cases merit careful discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting.[2] [37]
Risk factors such as cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension must be
managed according to appropriate guidelines.[1] [2] Lifestyle modifications include adopting a healthy
diet and increased physical activity and exercise as appropriate.[1] [2] Lipid-lowering therapy with statins
(with or without ezetimibe) is recommended for patients with asymptomatic stenosis for prevention of
cardiovascular events.[2] Patients undergoing endarterectomy or stenting should start or continue statin
therapy prior to the procedure; statins should not be stopped during the perioperative period, and should
be continued long term if tolerated.[2] Statins have a particularly important role in treating carotid stenosis
caused by atherosclerosis and patients should be encouraged to persist with these medications. Addition
of ezetimibe is recommended for those who do not reach lipid targets despite maximum tolerated dose
of statin. Additional or alternative treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies) should be considered for those patients who do not reach lipid targets
despite maximum tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe, or who are statin-intolerant.[2]
Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis
Symptomatic patients include those with transient ischemic attack, stroke, and transient monocular
blindness (amaurosis fugax).

Carotid artery stenosis Management
These patients should undergo carotid endarterectomy if the ipsilateral carotid stenosis is ≥50%.[1] [2][11]
[38] Rapid referral to a specialist as soon as the neurological event occurs is recommended, with early
revascularization (i.e., within 2 weeks) in patients whose neurological symptoms have stabilized.
Carotid stenting is more risky than carotid endarterectomy in older patients, but can be considered as
an alternative to surgery in younger patients (aged 65 years or less) in centers where carotid stenting
is regularly performed.[2] [39] [40] It is reasonable to perform carotid artery stenting as an alternative to
endarterectomy when the patient is considered to be high risk for surgery.[1] [2]
Antiplatelet therapy should be started preoperatively to reduce the risk of complications such as stroke
and MI. It should be initiated at diagnosis (after imaging has excluded intracranial hemorrhage) and
continued indefinitely after the procedure.[2] Aspirin alone, clopidogrel alone, or the combination of
aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole are preferred antiplatelet agents in symptomatic patients
undergoing carotid endarterectomy.[1] Dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) is preferred
in patients with stents and is used for at least 4 weeks after stenting, followed by antiplatelet monotherapy
indefinitely.[2] For symptomatic patients not being considered for carotid endarterectomy or stenting, the
2023 European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days
followed by clopidogrel monotherapy, or long-term aspirin plus modified-release dipyridamole.[2] Other
antiplatelet agents (e.g., ticagrelor or dipyridamole) may be considered if neither aspirin or clopidogrel can
be used, depending on availability.[2]
All symptomatic patients should receive high-intensity statin therapy for prevention of cardiovascular
events, treating to a target LDL-cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL.[2] Addition of ezetimibe is recommended
for those who do not reach lipid targets despite maximum tolerated dose of statin. Additional or alternative
treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors should be considered for those patients who do not reach lipid targets
despite maximum tolerated dose of statin and ezetimibe, or who are intolerant.[2] Patients should start
or continue statin therapy prior to endarterectomy or stenting; statins should not be stopped during the
perioperative period and should be continued long term if tolerated.[2]  
Risk factors such as cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension must be
managed according to appropriate guidelines.[1] [2] Lifestyle modifications include adopting a healthy diet
and increased physical activity and exercise as appropriate.[1] [2]
Concurrent carotid and coronary artery stenosis
The combination of carotid endarterectomy and coronary bypass is associated with a perioperative stroke,
MI, and death rate of 9% to 12%.[41] Therefore, the combined procedure is usually recommended for
patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and critically symptomatic coronary artery disease.[42]
Asymptomatic carotid stenosis may be addressed after coronary revascularization in most patients, but
a minority of patients with very tight bilateral carotid stenoses (70% to 99%) or those with a 70% to 99%
stenosis and a contra-lateral occlusion may benefit from staged carotid endarterectomy and coronary
bypass or synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary bypass.[2] Conversely, patients with
symptomatic carotid stenosis and stable coronary disease may have carotid endarterectomy performed
1-4 weeks before coronary bypass.[1]
Routine screening for coronary artery disease is not recommended preoperatively in people without
symptomatic coronary artery disease.[1] [2] A history and physical exam plus ECG (as for any
preoperative workup) are needed. Per American Heart Association recommendations, a history

suggestive of coronary artery disease or an abnormal ECG should prompt further testing for coronary
artery disease. This may involve a stress test or cardiac catheterization.
Bilateral carotid artery stenosis
In asymptomatic people found to have bilateral carotid stenoses ≥70%, the higher-grade stenosis is
generally addressed surgically first. In the case of equal degrees of stenosis, handedness is considered.
For example, the left carotid may be surgically treated first in a right-handed person.
In symptomatic people found to have asymptomatic carotid stenosis in a contralateral carotid artery, the
asymptomatic carotid stenosis is treated based on the merits of that stenosis. Generally if surgery is
indicated, it might be undertaken electively several weeks after treatment related to the acute neurologic
episode. This is to allow resolution of and observation of neurologic symptoms.
Relationship to any existing coronary artery disease may also need to be considered.
Antiplatelet therapy should be started preoperatively to reduce the risk of complications such as stroke
and MI. It should be initiated at diagnosis and continued indefinitely after the procedure. If the patient
undergoes endarterectomy, aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy is recommended. Dual antiplatelet therapy
(e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) is preferred in patients with stents and is used for at least 4 weeks after
stenting, followed by antiplatelet monotherapy indefinitely.[2]
Risk factors such as cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension must be
managed according to appropriate guidelines.[1] [2] Lifestyle modifications include adopting a healthy diet
and increased physical activity and exercise as appropriate.[1] [2]
Carotid restenosis
Recurrent high-grade stenosis after a prior carotid endarterectomy or stenting occurs infrequently
(approximately 6% over 2 years).[43] Restenosis is generally a consequence of neointimal hyperplasia
when it occurs within the first 2 years after surgery; and commonly due to new atherosclerotic plaque
when it occurs beyond 2 years after surgery. Residual stenosis is a stenosis found within 30 days of the
carotid intervention.
There is ongoing controversy regarding the optimal treatment approach for this relatively rare
occurrence.[2] [43] In many countries, medical management is recommended in asymptomatic patients
owing to the low risk of embolic stroke associated with neointimal hyperplasia. Revascularization is
reserved for symptomatic patients, and rarely for the infrequent cases of rapid progression. The method
of revascularization is not protocol driven and choice depends on the treating physician, but increasingly
carotid stenting is considered first to avoid the morbidity associated with redo carotid endarterectomy.
In patients undergoing stenting for restenosis, dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) is
used for the first 1-3 months, followed by aspirin alone taken indefinitely.[25]
Risk factors such as cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension must be
managed according to appropriate guidelines.[1] [2] Lifestyle modifications include adopting a healthy diet
and increased physical activity and exercise as appropriate.[1] [2]

to the pharmacologic treatment listed, for
patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis
≥70% if the risk of perioperative stroke,
myocardial infarction, and death is low.[1]
[11] The 2023 European Society for Vascular
Surgery guidelines recommend that carotid
endarterectomy should be considered in patients
with asymptomatic stenosis ≥60% to 99%
and an increased risk of late stroke, provided
perioperative stroke/death rates are low (≤3%)
and patient life expectancy exceeds 5 years.[2]
» Asymptomatic carotid stenosis may be
addressed after coronary revascularization in
patients with coronary artery disease.[1] 
» Intraoperative anticoagulation with heparin is
used to help to prevent thrombotic stroke as a
complication.
plus antiplatelet therapy and cardiovascular
risk reduction
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» aspirin: 75-325 mg orally once daily
Secondary options
» clopidogrel: 75 mg orally once daily
» Antiplatelet therapy should be started
preoperatively to reduce the risk of complications
such as stroke and myocardial infarction. It
should be initiated at diagnosis and continued
indefinitely after the procedure. In asymptomatic
patients with carotid artery stenosis, aspirin is
the preferred medication because of its known
benefits in preventing myocardial infarction
in vascular patients. In the presence of a
contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel is a
reasonable alternative; other antiplatelet agents
(e.g., dipyridamole) may be considered if neither
aspirin or clopidogrel can be used.[2]
» Patients on anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin)
for an unrelated indication should not be given
antiplatelet agents for carotid stenosis except
in special circumstances (e.g., presence
of a stent), and should continue on the
anticoagulant with the additional goal of
preventing atheroembolic stroke.[1][31]
» Risk factors such as cigarette smoking,
diabetes, and hypertension must be managed
according to appropriate guidelines.[1] [2]

prevention of cardiovascular events.[2] Patients
undergoing endarterectomy or stenting should
start or continue statin therapy prior to the
procedure; statins should not be stopped
during the perioperative period, and should be
continued long term if tolerated.[2] Statins have
a particularly important role in treating carotid
stenosis and patients should be encouraged to
persist with these medications.

those who do not reach lipid targets despite

asymptomatic carotid stenosis ≥70%:
poor surgical candidate
1st carotid artery stenting
» It is reasonable to perform carotid artery
stenting when revascularization is indicated
in patients who are poor surgical candidates
due to neck anatomy unfavorable for surgery
(e.g., very high lesion close to the base
of the skull, radiation-induced stenosis,
tracheostomy, or restenosis after a prior
carotid endarterectomy).[1] Results from the
CREST and ASCT-2 trials and a subsequent
meta-analysis have found that both stenting
and endarterectomy had a similar low risk of
complications and are similarly effective in
reducing the risk of disabling stroke.[32] [33] [35]
» The benefit of this procedure in asymptomatic
patients is only derived if they are at low risk for
myocardial infarction or death.
» This approach may differ in other countries.
For example, in the UK stenting is only
recommended within randomized controlled
trials.[36]

bilateral carotid stenosis

» In asymptomatic people found to have bilateral
carotid stenoses ≥70%, the higher-grade
stenosis is generally addressed surgically
first. In the case of equal degrees of stenosis,
handedness is considered. For example, the left
carotid would usually be surgically treated first in
a right-handed person.
» In symptomatic people (i.e., transient ischemic
attack, amaurosis fugax, or stroke) found to have
carotid stenosis in a contralateral carotid artery,
the asymptomatic carotid stenosis is treated
based on the merits of that stenosis. Generally
if surgery is indicated, it might be undertaken
electively several weeks after treatment related
to the acute neurologic episode. This is to allow
resolution of and observation of neurologic
symptoms.
» In the case where bilateral carotid
endarterectomy is required, the evaluation
of cranial nerve function (IX, X, XII) may be
indicated prior to the second surgery.

disease may also need to be considered.

carotid restenosis
1st continued antiplatelet therapy and
cardiovascular risk reduction ±
revascularization
» Recurrent high-grade stenosis after a prior
carotid endarterectomy or stenting occurs
infrequently (approximately 6% over 2 years).[43]
» Restenosis is generally a consequence of
neointimal hyperplasia when it occurs within the
first 2 years after surgery; and commonly due
to new atherosclerotic plaque when it occurs
beyond 2 years after surgery.
» Residual stenosis is a stenosis found within 30
days of the carotid intervention.
» There is ongoing controversy regarding the
optimal treatment approach for this relatively
rare occurrence.[2] [43] In many countries,
medical management is recommended in
asymptomatic patients owing to the low risk
of embolic stroke associated with neointimal
hyperplasia. Revascularization is reserved
for symptomatic patients, and rarely for the
infrequent cases of rapid progression. The
method of revascularization is not protocol driven
and choice depends on the treating physician,
but increasingly carotid stenting is considered
first to avoid the morbidity associated with redo
carotid endarterectomy. In patients undergoing
stenting for restenosis, dual antiplatelet therapy
is used for the first 1-3 months, followed by
aspirin alone.[25]

target LDL-cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL.[2][44]
[45] Statins have a particularly important role in
treating carotid stenosis and patients should be
encouraged to persist with these medications. 
» Addition of ezetimibe is recommended for
those who do not reach lipid targets despite
maximum tolerated dose of statin. Additional or
alternative treatment with proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors
(monoclonal antibodies) should be considered
for those patients who do not reach lipid targets
despite maximum tolerated dose of statin and
ezetimibe, or who are intolerant.[2]

Carotid artery stenosis Management
Emerging
Carotid stenosis risk prediction tool
There are several tools available that can be used to predict the risk of stroke in patients and stratify
patients for specific therapies; however, none of them are prospectively validated or recommended by
guidelines. One example is the carotid stenosis risk prediction tool. It is a model used for predicting the risk
of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with recently symptomatic carotid bifurcation stenosis. This tool is
currently considered to be a research tool.  [Carotid stenosis risk prediction tool] (https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/
divisions/cpsd/carotid-stenosis-tool)  A recalibrated version of this tool (the Carotid Artery Risk Score) is
being tested in European Carotid Surgery Trial 2.  [European Carotid Surgery Trial 2 (ECST-2)] (http://
s489637516.websitehome.co.uk/ECST2/index2.htm)
Transcarotid artery revascularization
Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is a hybrid approach to treat carotid artery stenosis. The
procedure requires surgical access to the common carotid artery at the base of the neck through an incision
just above the clavicle, the introduction of a novel cerebrovascular flow-reversal device, and direct stenting
of the carotid artery lesion. The flow-reversal device and accompanying carotid stent received Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the US in 2015. Surgeons within the US have received standardized
training in this procedure.[46] The learning curve for this form of carotid artery stenting is quite steep.[47]
 The stroke and death rates with TCAR are low in observational studies and in nonrandomized comparisons
with transfemoral carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy.[48] [49][50] While these results are
encouraging, the exact role of TCAR in carotid artery revascularization remains to be clarified since there is
no planned randomized trial comparing medical therapy to TCAR in asymptomatic patients, and no such trial
planned comparing its performance to transfemoral carotid stenting or to carotid endarterectomy.
Primary prevention
Primary prevention of carotid atherosclerotic stenosis involves appropriate treatment of risk factors. There is
good evidence to support the aggressive management of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking
cessation to prevent carotid stenosis and stroke.[1]
Secondary prevention
Patients should be advised to maintain an active lifestyle with regular cardiovascular exercise.
Continued treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking cessation, as well as
antiplatelet therapy, is recommended.
Patient discussions
Patients should be made aware of the need for intensive management of atherosclerosis risk factors,
including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking cessation.
Patients should be instructed to take aspirin or alternative antiplatelet therapy indefinitely.

Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients should be followed up annually after the postoperative visits associated with revascularization. In
some countries, annual surveillance is not recommended. Clinical evaluation should include assessment
for development of new transient ischemic attack or stroke-like symptoms, which might require referral to
a neurologist for confirmation of the diagnosis. Testing might include noninvasive duplex ultrasound exam
to identify potential recurrent stenosis or the development of stenosis in the contralateral carotid artery.
Patients placed on pharmacologic management and who have not had revascularization might also be
followed annually for possible disease progression in the form of increasing degrees of stenosis.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
stroke after carotid endarterectomy short term low
Generally caused by thrombosis of the endarterectomy site with intracranial embolism; or by embolization
of atheromatous debris from the endarterectomized arterial surface.
Intraoperative anticoagulation with heparin and meticulous surgical technique are the best forms of
prevention.
If a neurologic deficit is observed in the immediate postoperative period, this may be secondary to
technical error. In this event, patients should be returned immediately to the operating room for re-
exploration. Perioperative thromboembolic or atheroembolic strokes may prompt endovascular rescue
attempts in the form of thrombectomy or thrombolysis.
stroke after carotid artery stenting short term low
Generally caused by thrombosis of the stent with intracranial embolism; or by embolization of
atheromatous debris generated during delivery or deployment of the stent.
Preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel once daily along with intraoperative
anticoagulation with heparin to maintain activated clotting times of 250 to 300 milliseconds is the best form
of prevention. Dual antiplatelet therapy is used for 1 to 3 months following stenting, followed by aspirin
alone.[25]
myocardial infarction after carotid endarterectomy or
stenting
short term low
The risk of myocardial infarction is as high as 2.3% after carotid endarterectomy and 1.1% after carotid
artery stenting, and depends on the cardiac status of the patient. The risk is concentrated within the first
few days of the procedure.[32]
Aspirin before carotid endarterectomy, and aspirin plus clopidogrel before carotid artery stenting are the
optimal methods of prevention.
hematomas and access site bleeding short term low
Incisional hematomas (carotid endarterectomy) or puncture site hematomas (carotid artery stenting) are
infrequent and best managed expectantly.
Rarely, expansile hematomas from continued active bleeding require operative intervention and blood
transfusions.
cranial nerve injuries after carotid endarterectomy short term low
Injuries to the hypoglossal, vagus, and glossopharyngeal nerves occur in about 6% of patients after
surgery.[57] 
They are most commonly a result of traction; rarely from a complete transection.
Most deficits will recover within 6 months of the surgery.

Carotid artery stenosis Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
The risk of postoperative cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is highest in the first
72 hours after revascularization.
cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome short term low
Neurologic symptoms (e.g., unilateral headache, stroke, seizure) occurring within hours, or sometimes
days, after carotid artery revascularization.
This is a rare complication. It is more frequently associated with revascularization of an extremely
tight stenosis and with a concomitant occlusion or tight stenosis in the opposite (contralateral) carotid
artery. It is believed to occur slightly more frequently after carotid artery stenting compared to carotid
endarterectomy because of the more aggressive intraprocedural anticoagulation used during carotid artery
stenting.
Patients often present with nonspecific headaches and difficult to control hypertension postoperatively.
Other symptoms include unilateral headaches, strokes, or seizures.
Brain imaging may reveal cerebral edema with or without frank hemorrhage. Severe instances may be
associated with a midline shift.
Management is essentially supportive and includes control of blood pressure, reduction of anticoagulation
(if any is being used), head elevation, and surgical decompression in the worst instances.
postoperative cerebral hemorrhage short term low
This is a rare complication of endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting and is generally associated with
the aggressive anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy utilized during the procedure or hypertension in the
postoperative phase.
When part of the cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, symptoms include unilateral headaches, seizures, or
strokes.
Treatment is guided by the severity of the complication and is generally supportive. It may include
management of blood pressure, head elevation, and surgical decompression in severe cases.
ischemic stroke variable medium
In patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, the annual stroke rate ranges from 1% to 5%.[55] [56]
 The risk rises if a prior transient ischemic attack or stroke has already occurred and approaches 10% per
year.[24]
The etiology is usually atherosclerotic plaque disruption and embolization with ischemic brain infarction.
For asymptomatic stenoses <70%, optimal pharmacologic therapy is the mainstay of stroke prevention,
while revascularization is reserved for selected patients with high-grade stenoses ≥70%.

Carotid artery stenosis Follow up
Prognosis
Prognosis is related to the degree of carotid stenosis.[25] Patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis 70%
or less managed with pharmacologic therapy demonstrate progression to high-grade stenosis at a generally
modest rate of no more than 5% per year. Carotid artery revascularization is effective in preventing stroke,
and around 1% of patients per year have a stroke after carotid endarterectomy or stenting.[53] Both carotid
endarterectomy and stenting are anatomically durable procedures, and restenosis occurs in approximately
6% of patients over 2 years after either procedure.[54] Patients must be followed clinically and with a
noninvasive duplex ultrasound exam on an annual basis. In some other countries, annual surveillance is not
recommended.
Carotid stenosis is also a marker for atherosclerosis elsewhere in the vascular tree. Appropriate and
aggressive identification and management of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking cessation
must continue lifelong after treatment for carotid stenosis.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,

Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
