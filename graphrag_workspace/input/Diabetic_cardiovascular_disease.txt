Diabetic cardiovascular disease Overview
Summary
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in people with diabetes.
People with diabetes have up to a fourfold increased risk of stroke and are twice as likely to die after
myocardial infarction than people without diabetes.
Regular physical activity, medical nutrition therapy, and smoking cessation or non-initiation are important
lifestyle changes for the primary prevention of CVD.
Selected glucose-lowering drugs reduce all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. Addition of a sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist is strongly
recommended in patients with established atherosclerotic CV and/or chronic kidney disease. SGLT2
inhibitors are also indicated in patients with heart failure. Evidence also supports the use of a GLP-1 receptor
agonist for primary prevention of stroke in patients at high CV risk.
Aggressive treatment of hypertension, use of lipid-lowering therapy, preventive anticoagulation, and coronary
revascularization (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery
during episodes of acute coronary syndrome) can lead to improved survival.
Definition
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, resulting from defects
in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.[1] The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-
term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and
blood vessels.[1] Diabetes is an established major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease,
including coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack), and
peripheral arterial disease.[2] This topic will discuss CAD in greatest detail.

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Diabetes prevalence is increasing worldwide, compounded by both population growth and aging.[3] In the
US, 29.3 million adults (10.6% of the population) had diagnosed diabetes between 2017 and 2020, while
a further 9.7 million (3.5% of the population) had undiagnosed diabetes.[4] Worldwide, 536.6 million adults
had diabetes in 2021, and projections estimate that 783.2 million adults will have diabetes by 2045.[1]
Total diabetes prevalence, especially among older adults, primarily reflects type 2 diabetes, which in 2021
accounted for 96% of diabetes cases.[5]
Diabetes confers a two- to fourfold excess lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular disease ([CVD]; coronary
artery disease [CAD], stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease), independent
of other risk factors.[6] CVD is the leading cause of hospital admission for people with diabetes, with CAD
as the predominant subtype.[7] Data from the CALIBER UK cohort show the most common initial CVD
complications for those with diabetes to be PAD (16.2%) and heart failure (14.1%), followed by stable angina
(11.9%), nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (11.5%), and stroke (10.3%).[8]
Globally, it is estimated that 50% of deaths among patients with type 2 diabetes are due to CVD.[9] In 2014,
death due to CVD was 1.7 times higher among adults with diabetes than in adults without diabetes.[10] While
there was an overall decrease in cardiovascular (CV) mortality from 1998 to 2014, decreases were smaller
for adults with type 2 diabetes compared with adults without diabetes.[11] One Danish population-based
cohort study found that from 1996 to 2015, the 5-year risk of first-time ischemic stroke was approximately
halved in patients with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus and no prior atherosclerotic CVD.[12] Increased use
of medication to control CV risk factors has likely influenced the decrease in CV morbidity and mortality in
patients with type 2 diabetes.[13]
Although the risk of CVD in patients with type 1 diabetes has also decreased over time, there remains
considerable excess CV risk in this group compared with the general population.[14] [15] One Finnish study
found the risk of CVD to be 64.3% in patients with type 1 diabetes of duration >50 years, compared with
7.4% in individuals without diabetes.[16]
CAD (MI, angina)
CAD is the most common manifestation of CVD in people with diabetes. In patients with established CAD,
70% to 75% have abnormal glucose regulation, with more than 30% having known diabetes, up to 20%
having undiagnosed diabetes, and around 25% having impaired glucose tolerance or prediabetes.[17] [18]
Mortality from MI is about 1.5- to 2-fold greater in people with diabetes than in people without diabetes.[19]
In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), the odds ratio for acute MI case fatality was 1.17 per 1%
increase in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).[20] Additionally, patients with diabetes who are admitted with high-risk
non-ST elevation MI are known to have worse early outcomes, including mortality, compared with patients
without diabetes who present similarly.[21]
Heart failure
Although not as frequent as MI, hospitalization for heart failure is a common event in patients with type 2
diabetes.[22] People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to develop heart failure than those without type
2 diabetes and the prevalence of heart failure in people with type 2 diabetes in the US is estimated to be as
high as 22%.[23] Greater levels of insulin resistance and dysglycemia are associated with increased risk of
heart failure in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.[23] [24] Type 2 diabetes duration has also
been identified as an independent risk factor for heart failure, with each 5-year increase associated with a
17% increased risk.[23]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Theory
Women appear to be more at risk of heart failure than men, potentially due to a greater burden of
cardiometabolic risk factors such as increased body mass index and systolic blood pressure at the time
of diabetes diagnosis, therapeutic inertia that disproportionately affects women, and distinct hormone
profiles.[23] Similarly, racial disparities have been reported in the type 2 diabetes-associated risk of heart
failure, with black individuals at higher risk than those of other races; these differences largely seem to be
driven by a higher burden of adverse social determinants of health, including lower income and lower access
to health care.[23]
Cerebrovascular disease (stroke and transient ischemic attack)
The risk of stroke is increased 1.5- to 4-fold in patients with diabetes.[25] [26] Diabetes is associated with
a significantly increased risk of stroke recurrence.[27] Stroke outcomes, including in-hospital and long-term
mortality, are worse in people with diabetes.[26] Diabetes increases the risk of ischemic stroke to a greater
degree than hemorrhagic stroke. Lacunar infarcts are more common in patients with diabetes, who are more
likely to develop silent lacunar infarcts. However, transient ischemic attacks are less common in people with
diabetes than in those without diabetes. The risk of stroke increases with worsening glycemic control. In the
UKPDS, the odds ratio for stroke case fatality was 1.37 per 1% increase in HbA1c.[20]
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
Cigarette smoking and diabetes are the two major risk factors for PAD.[28] Risk factors associated with
an increased risk for PAD in people with diabetes include increased age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, poor
glycemic control, longer duration of diabetes, neuropathy, retinopathy, and a prior history of CVD.[29] Of
symptomatic patients with PAD, 20% are known to have diabetes; however, most patients with PAD are
asymptomatic. Up to two-thirds of people with asymptomatic PAD have been shown to have comorbid
diabetes.[29] Diabetes is associated with increased risk of critical lower extremity ischemia and major
amputation in patients with PAD.[30]
Etiology
The etiology of cardiovascular disease in diabetes is complex and multifactorial. It results from the interplay
of a constellation of metabolic risk factors, excessive oxidation, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and
imbalance in prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic processes.[31] The unifying metabolic factor is hyperglycemia,
which results from both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is associated with a
variety of major metabolic risk factors including hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure,
and obesity.[32] [33] Hyperglycemia leads to excessive oxidation and accumulation of advanced glycation
end-products, while peroxidation of lipids leads to foam cell formation within the arterial wall.[34] [35] Insulin
resistance is an important precursor to endothelial dysfunction and associated with increased release of
inflammatory proteins, including cytokines, C-reactive protein, and subsequent release of growth factors that
stimulate smooth-muscle proliferation and platelet aggregation.[36] [37] This cascade ultimately leads to
arterial intimal thickening, increased plaque formation, and atherosclerosis.[37]
Pathophysiology
The underlying mechanism for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes is accelerated atherosclerosis.[38]
Autopsy studies have shown that type 2 diabetes is associated with a global coronary disease burden and a
prevalence of high-grade atherosclerosis similar to that observed in nondiabetic patients with an antemortem
diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD); among deceased patients with diabetes who had no diagnosis

THEORY
of CAD, almost three quarters were found to have high-grade coronary atherosclerosis and more than
half had multivessel disease.[39] Furthermore, angiographic data have shown that people with diabetes
have more diffuse, extensive, multivessel (including left main), and distal disease than do people without
diabetes.[40]
The clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis depend on the vascular bed involved. When atherosclerosis
involves the coronary arteries it presents as angina pectoris and acute coronary syndromes. When it involves
the cerebral or cerebellar arteries it presents as transient ischemic attacks and strokes. Involvement of the
peripheral circulation presents as intermittent claudication or gangrene.
The process of atherosclerosis begins with damage to the endothelial cell layer.[38] Under physiologic
conditions, the endothelial cell layer separates cells and circulating factors from the arterial intima and media
and serves as an anticoagulant and fibrinolytic surface.[31] Circulating factors such as blood glucose, free
fatty acids, and glycation end-products damage the endothelial layer, leading to adhesion and penetration
of circulating monocytes and macrophages into the arterial intima. The endothelial cells and macrophages
produce cytokines and growth factors that allow smooth-muscle migration and proliferation, leading to
formation of the atherosclerotic plaque.[38] Continued exposure to circulating factors leads to cell death, and
the combination of a large lipid core, necrotic tissue, macrophages, and a thin fibrous cap predisposes to
plaque rupture.[31] Plaque rupture and thrombosis are responsible for the clinical events associated with
CVD, including acute coronary syndromes and strokes. The development of atherosclerosis is usually a
slow process, but in people with diabetes it is more rapid and aggressive and produces clinical disease at an
earlier age.[38]
Aortic aneurysm is associated with atherosclerosis; however, current evidence suggests that patients
with diabetes have a lower risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysm compared with those without
diabetes.[41] [42] The protective mechanism is yet to be determined; however, possibilities include reduced
extracellular matrix volume, altered inflammatory pathways, and the effects of oral antihyperglycemic
drug.[42] [43]
Due to the overlap in pathophysiology between diabetes, CVD, obesity, and chronic kidney disease,
some groups argue that these conditions should be considered to be on a single spectrum known as
cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. The American Heart Association, notably, has endorsed
this terminology and proposed a four-stage model based on a patient’s number of risk factors and the
presence of overt CVD.[44] It has also developed a series of risk prediction equations, known as PREVENT,
for estimating 10- and 30-year CVD risks based on the CKM concept.[45] It is hoped that this new approach
will improve screening, prevention, and treatment of CKM risk factors, particularly in people with adverse
social determinants of health.[44]
Disruption of the gut microbiome has been postulated to play an important role in the development of
various obesity-related metabolic abnormalities, among them type 2 diabetes and CVD. The intestinal
microbiota therefore appears to be a promising target for the nutritional or therapeutic management of these
diseases.[46]

Case history
Case history #1
A 50-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents with crushing substernal chest pain. He is taking
metformin, glipizide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. He has mild obesity and has a 20 pack-year history of
smoking. Mild left-sided chest pain occurred 2 weeks ago while mowing the lawn. The pain lasted for only
a few minutes and resolved with rest. Today more severe chest pain occurred while mowing the lawn,
accompanied by shortness of breath and sweating.
Other presentations
In most patients, chest pain is the primary presenting symptom of coronary artery disease. In patients
with diabetes, who often suffer from neuropathy and loss of sensation, ischemia may occur with
no associated pain. Other patients may present with atypical symptoms, including shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, or arm numbness. Women also tend to have more atypical
presentations compared with men. Presentations of other forms of cardiovascular disease may include
symptoms of claudication or stroke.

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Presence of risk factors
For prevention and management of both atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and heart failure,
cardiovascular (CV) risk factors should be systematically assessed at least annually in all people with
diabetes. These risk factors include duration of diabetes, obesity/overweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
smoking, a family history of premature coronary disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the presence
of albuminuria.[2] [29]
Female sex and elevated C-reactive protein levels confer additional CVD risk.[77] [78] [81] [92]
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atherosclerotic CVD risk calculator
should be used to aid with overall CVD risk assessment and the 10-year risk for first CVD event.  [AHA/
ACC: ASCVD risk calculator] (http://static.heart.org/riskcalc/app/index.html#!/baseline-risk)  A European
equivalent, known as SCORE2-Diabetes, is recommended by the European Society of Cardiology for use
in people ages 40 to 69 years with type 2 diabetes.[6]
Symptoms
Symptoms specific to CVD should be elicited in the history.
Coronary artery disease (CAD)
• Chest discomfort (may be absent in 20% to 30% of patients with diabetes, often called "silent
ischemia")[19]
• Dyspnea on exertion; diaphoresis; nausea.
Cerebrovascular disease
• Numbness; tingling; headache; hemiparesis; aphasia.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
• Most patients with PAD are asymptomatic. Intermittent claudication occurs in only 33% to 50% of
patients.[139] Claudication presents as aching, burning, cramping, discomfort, or fatigue in the
buttock, thigh, calf, or ankle on exertion. Symptoms occur consistently during walking, increase with
progressive exercise intensity, and are quickly relieved by rest (usually within 10 minutes).[28]
• Rest pain in severe disease; often affects the forefoot and is worsened with limb elevation and
relieved by dependency.[28]
• Other nonjoint-related exertional lower extremity symptoms (not typical of claudication) or
symptoms of impaired walking function: may include leg muscle discomfort associated with walking
that requires >10 minutes of rest to resolve, or leg weakness/numbness/fatigue during walking
without pain.[28]
• Erectile dysfunction.[28]
• History of nonhealing or slow-healing lower extremity wound.[28]
Heart failure
• Dyspnea; persistent cough; ankle edema; fatigue.

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Diagnosis
• In patients with diabetes, blood pressure (BP) ≥130/80 mmHg confirmed using ≥2 measurements
obtained on ≥2 occasions.[29]
• Patients with diabetic CVD may also be diagnosed with hypertension if BP ≥180/110 mmHg is
recorded at a single visit.[29]
Acute myocardial infarction (MI) or congestive heart failure
• Rales; hypotension; peripheral edema; tachycardia; S3 gallop; jugular venous distention.
Cerebrovascular accident
• Aphasia; hemisensory loss; cranial nerve palsies; hemiparesis.
PAD
• Decreased or absent lower extremity pulses (femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, or posterior tibial
arteries); bruit over narrowed artery (e.g., epigastric, periumbilical, groin); hair loss; smooth, shiny
skin; nonhealing lower extremity ulcers and necrosis; nail bed changes; calf muscle atrophy;
elevation pallor/dependent rubor.[28]
Investigations
• All patients should have a baseline lipid profile and this should be repeated regularly.[29]
• C-reactive protein is not a routine test but may be useful for risk stratification.[81] [82] [83]
• Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used to monitor glycemic control.[29]
Suspected CAD and/or heart failure
In asymptomatic individuals, routine screening for CAD is not recommended as it does not improve
outcomes as long as risk factors for atherosclerotic CVD are treated.[29] However, measurement of
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on
at least a yearly basis should be considered to screen asymptomatic adults with diabetes for heart
failure.[29] [140] This is because adults with diabetes are at increased risk for the development of
asymptomatic cardiac structural or functional abnormalities (stage B heart failure) or symptomatic
(stage C) heart failure.[29] If abnormal natriuretic peptide levels are detected, echocardiography is
recommended. Identification, risk stratification, and early treatment of risk factors in people with diabetes
and asymptomatic stages of heart failure reduce the risk for progression to symptomatic heart failure.[29]
All patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of CAD should have a resting 12-lead ECG. A chest x-ray
(CXR) is not a routine test but may be useful to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion and evaluate
for alternative causes of dyspnea. The sensitivity of CXR for making a diagnosis is poor. For example, 1 in
5 individuals with acute heart failure has no signs of congestion on a CXR.[140]
Diagnostic cardiac testing should be considered in those with: 1) typical or atypical cardiac symptoms;
and 2) an abnormal resting ECG.
• Transthoracic doppler echocardiogram (echo): two-dimensional echo with Doppler assessment
at rest is a key diagnostic test in the evaluation of chest pain or shortness of breath as well as
establishing the initial diagnosis and cause of clinical heart failure.[140] Visualization of left and
right ventricular function and regional wall motion abnormalities allows for the assessment of CAD
risk and may help to guide clinical decision-making. Performance of echo at the bedside is ideal
for patients with acute chest pain and can be done using point-of-care or handheld devices in
institutions where such capabilities are available.[29]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Exercise ECG: often used as an initial test. Can be used without or with imaging (e.g., stress
echocardiography).[29] It is suitable for patients, who can exercise and who have a resting ECG
that is interpretable for ST-segment shifts.[141] [142] Symptom-limited exercise ECG involves
graded exercise until physical fatigue, limiting chest pain, marked ischemia, or a drop in blood
pressure occurs. Candidates for exercise ECG are those: a) without disabling comorbidity
(e.g., frailty, marked obesity [body mass index >40 kg/m²], PAD, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, or orthopedic limitations) and capable of performing exercise safely; and b) without ST-
T abnormalities on resting ECG (e.g., >0.5 mm ST depression, left ventricular hypertrophy, paced
rhythm, left bundle branch block, Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern, or digoxin use).[142] There is a
paucity of data on the predictive power of exercise testing in patients with diabetes, but available
data suggest that ischemic findings on exercise ECG are predictive of prognosis.[143] In a study
of 1282 patients (15% with diabetes), sensitivity (47% vs. 52%), and specificity (81% vs. 80%) for
exercise treadmill testing were similar in people with and without diabetes.[144]
• Pharmacologic stress testing: patients who have resting ECG abnormalities that preclude
exercise stress testing or those unable to exercise should undergo pharmacologic stress echo
or nuclear imaging.[29] [141] [142] Stress echo can be used to define ischemia severity and for
risk stratification purposes. Nuclear imaging (positron emission tomography [PET] or single-
photon emission computed tomography [SPECT] myocardial perfusion imaging) enables detection
of perfusion abnormalities, measurement of left ventricular function, and detection of high-risk
findings, such as transient ischemic dilation.[142]
• Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or stress cardiac MRI (if available), may be useful in
select patients with diabetes. Cardiac MRI can provide information about viability in patients with
multivessel disease and severe left ventricular dysfunction.[145] These tests have the capability
to accurately assess global and regional left and right ventricular function, detect and localize
myocardial ischemia and infarction, and determine myocardial viability, without the need for
radiation.[142] [145] They can also detect myocardial edema and microvascular obstruction, which
can help differentiate acute versus chronic myocardial infarction, as well as other causes of acute
chest pain, including myocarditis.[142] However, do not recommend performing stress cardiac MRI
in patients with acute chest pain and high probability of CAD/acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[146]
 Stress cardiac MRI can increase risk and delay treatment in patients with acute chest pain and
markers of high risk, such as ST segment elevation and/or positive cardiac biomarkers.[146]
• Computed tomography (CT) scan for coronary artery calcium (CAC): several studies have shown
that using ≥16-slice CT scanners, CAC score >400 is associated with high likelihood of inducible
myocardial ischemia and should prompt further testing.[147] In patients with pretest likelihood of
CAD <50%, a CAC score of 0 provides very strong evidence against the presence of CAD, with
a high degree of certainty.[148] Do not order a CAC test in patients with known atherosclerotic
disease, including those with stents and bypass grafts, as it offers limited incremental prognostic
value for these individuals.[149] [150]
• CT coronary angiography (CTA): ≥16-slice CT scanners have 90% sensitivity and 90%
specificity for >50% diameter stenosis, which is the minimum criterion for consideration of
revascularization.[148] CTA may be useful for patients with equivocal myocardial perfusion
scanning; for ruling out left main or triple-vessel CAD; for patients with cardiomyopathy unrelated
to CAD to rule out significant ischemic heart disease; and for young patients undergoing valvular
surgery for preoperative planning.[148] Screening for asymptomatic obstructive CAD among
patients with type 1 diabetes and patients with type 2 diabetes using CTA is not beneficial.[151] Do
not use CTA in high-risk emergency patients presenting with acute chest pain.[150] [152]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Diagnosis
• Invasive coronary angiography: usually reserved for patients with acute coronary syndrome,
frequent angina, high-risk and/or high pretest probability of CAD that requires surgical or
percutaneous intervention, and/or high-risk findings on stress testing.[142]
Suspected cerebrovascular accident
• CT or MRI of the head and duplex ultrasonography of carotids if indicated by symptoms.
Suspected PAD
• Joint American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend that
all patients with history or physical exam findings suggestive of PAD should have a resting ankle-
brachial index (ABI), with or without ankle pulse volume recordings and/or Doppler waveforms.[28]
Screening with resting ABI is also considered reasonable in patients with any of the following
characteristics: age ≥65 years or older; age 50 to 64 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis
(e.g., diabetes, smoking history, dyslipidemia, hypertension), CKD, or family history of PAD;
age <50 years with diabetes and one additional risk factor for atherosclerosis; patients with
known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (e.g., coronary, carotid, subclavian, renal,
mesenteric artery stenosis, or abdominal aortic aneurysm).[28] The American Diabetes Association
recommends screening for PAD using ABI in asymptomatic people with any of the following
characteristics: age ≥50 years; diabetes with duration ≥10 years; comorbid microvascular disease;
clinical evidence of foot complications; or any end-organ damage from diabetes.[29]
• ABI of 1.0 to 1.4 is normal. ABI of ≤0.9 indicates the presence of PAD in the legs. ABI of 0.91 to
0.99 is borderline.[28]
• ABI may not be accurate in patients with noncompressible arteries, such as those with long-
standing diabetes mellitus or CKD, particularly those on dialysis. Diagnosis of PAD should not be
excluded based on normal or raised ankle brachial pressure index alone in people with diabetes or
CKD.[28] See Peripheral arterial disease .

Risk factors
Strong
cigarette smoking
• Cigarette smoking (both active and passive) is an independent risk factor for both cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and diabetes.[47] [48] [49] The risk of developing diabetes is 30% to 40% higher for
active smokers than nonsmokers and there is a positive dose-response relationship between the
number of cigarettes smoked and the risk of developing diabetes.[50]
• There is a well-established link between smoking cessation and reduction in CVD morbidity and
mortality.[48]

hypertension
• Hypertension occurs in 50% to 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 30% of patients with type
1 diabetes.[51] In patients with diabetes, coexistent hypertension further increases the risk for CVD,
diabetic retinopathy, and renal insufficiency.[52] [53] [54] A 5 mmHg reduction of systolic blood
pressure (BP) has been shown to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events by about
10%.[55]
• It is well accepted that BP control reduces CV risk in patients with diabetes; however, certain pivotal
studies investigating the benefits of intensive (<120 mmHg) versus standard (<140 mmHg) BP control
yielded discordant results.[56] [57] [58] [59] Guidelines recommend a BP treatment goal of <130/80
mmHg, providing this can be safely attained.[6] [29] [60] [61]
dyslipidemia
• People with diabetes can have various types of dyslipidemia. However, a major risk factor for CVD in
patients with type 2 diabetes is a distinctive atherogenic triad of hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increased small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C).[62] [63]
poor glycemic control
• A 1% increase in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) increases the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or
peripheral arterial disease by 18% in people with diabetes.[47] Increases in fasting blood glucose in
mid-life are also associated with increased risk for CVD later in life.[64] In addition, evidence suggests
that higher HbA1c variability (indicating higher fluctuations in glucose levels) is associated with
increased CVD risk.[65] [66]
• Evidence for intensive glycemic control decreasing risk of CVD is stronger in type 1 than type 2
diabetes; however, controlling HbA1c to <7% (<53 mmol/mol) is recommended in most patients with
type 2 diabetes to improve clinical outcomes.[29] [67] Achieving a target of <7% (<53 mmol/mol) has
been shown to reduce CVD risk by 37% over 11 years.[47]
physical inactivity
• Sedentary behavior and insufficient physical activity are established risk factors for CVD in people with
and without diabetes.[68] [69] Many individuals with type 2 diabetes do not meet the recommended
exercise level per week.[29] [70]
• Increased physical activity decreases all-cause mortality and CVD-related mortality in type 2
diabetes.[47] [71] [72] One small-scale randomized controlled trial of patients with type 1 diabetes
found that high-intensity interval training improved cardiac function and structure compared with
standard of care.[73]
overweight and obesity
• There is a clear correlation between increasing prevalence of diabetes and increasing body mass
index (BMI), with overweight (BMI >25 kg/m²) and obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²) significantly increasing the
risk of CV events in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.[54] [74] [75]
• It is estimated that obesity is associated with a twofold increased risk of CVD.[47] Obesity promotes
CVD through its direct impact on cardiac functioning, and its indirect effects on hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and inflammation.[47]

albuminuria
• Albumin levels ≥30 mg/g creatinine are associated with increased CVD risk in patients with
diabetes.[76]
• In the Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, the presence of microalbuminuria
was associated with a 1.97-fold increased relative risk of the primary aggregate end point (myocardial
infarction [MI], stroke, or CVD death) among people with and without diabetes.[77] In the Losartan
Intervention for Endpoint Reduction (LIFE) trial, every 10-fold increase in the albumin/creatinine
ratio was associated with a 39% increased risk of CVD death, MI, or stroke among people with
diabetes.[78] HOPE and LIFE findings are supported and strengthened by the results of a Danish
cohort study of almost 70,000 patients with type 2 diabetes and no overt CVD.[79]
chronic kidney disease (CKD)
• CKD is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, independent of diabetes and other traditional risk
factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Worsening kidney function (lower glomerular filtration
rate, increased albuminuria) is associated with progressively increased risk of coronary disease.[80]
elevated C-reactive protein
• Among 746 men with diabetes followed for an average of 5 years, those in the highest quartile for C-
reactive protein (CRP) had a 2.6-fold increased risk of CVD events compared with those in the lowest
quartile.[81]
• Elevated CRP has also been associated with increased CV risk and dyslipidemia in Korean and sub-
Saharan African populations.[82] [83]
family history of CVD
• Further increases risk of developing CVD in patients with diabetes.[2] [29] Premature CVD is defined
as ages <55 years in males and ages <65 years in females.[76]
female sex
• Diabetes has a significantly greater impact on risk of adverse CV outcomes in women than in men.[84]
[85] [86] [87] [88] [89]
• One study encompassing >850,000 individuals found that diabetes conferred a 44% greater excess
risk for coronary heart disease in women compared with men.[87] Another study found that women
with type 1 diabetes had an 86% greater excess risk of fatality from CVD than men with type 1
diabetes.[84] Excess risk of heart failure associated with both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is
also significantly greater in women than in men.[88]
• There is a need for more research in this arena; however, potential mechanisms conferring excess risk
include biologic/sex-specific factors, gender-related disparities, and traditional risk factors. Sex-specific
factors include premature menopause, gestational diabetes, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy,
breast cancer treatment, and systemic inflammatory or autoimmune disorders.[90] [91]
• Biologic factors such as early menopause (ages <45 years) and increased coronary artery calcification
in women compared with men may also partly explain the difference in CVD risk.[84] [91] [92] Gender-
related disparities such as intimate partner violence, psychosocial factors, and socioeconomic
deprivation are also implicated.[90] [92]
• Transgender women, including those with diabetes, are also at higher risk for CVD, which
observational data suggest may be due to estrogen use.[93]
• Evidence for the effect of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on CVD outcomes in women with
type 2 diabetes is mostly lacking due to no or limited inclusion of participants with diabetes in clinical

studies. One study using pooled data from three landmark prospective CVD cohorts in the US found
that MHT was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in CVD risk among white,
but not black, women with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.[94]
• A 2023 scientific statement from the American Heart Association on the impact of race and
ethnicity on CVD risk factors in women noted that CVD is the leading cause of death in women,
with risk varying between different racial and ethnic groups.[95] It suggested that there is a need
for an expanded approach to risk factors and primary prevention strategies for CVD in women of
underrepresented races and ethnicities, who are particularly vulnerable to health disparities.[95]
gestational diabetes
• Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risks of overall and type-specific CV and
cerebrovascular diseases. This is not solely attributed to conventional CV risk factors or subsequent
type 2 diabetes.[96] [97]
mental illness
• Patients with severe mental illness have an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and CVD, with a
two- to fourfold higher rate of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome compared
with the general population.[98] Diabetes can be exacerbated by antipsychotic treatments which alter
glucose metabolism and promote weight gain. Furthermore, these patients are more likely to smoke,
be obese, have obstructive sleep apnoea, live a sedentary lifestyle, and eat unhealthily, leading to an
increased risk of CVD.[98]
• The PRIMROSE (PRedIction and Management of cardiovascular Risk in peOple with SEvere
mental illnesses) lipid model and the PRIMROSE body mass index model have been specifically
developed and validated to predict the 10-year risk of incident CVD events in patients with severe
mental illness.[99] The PRIMROSE model demonstrated that additional risk factors contributed to
the development of CVD including social deprivation, severe mental illness subtype, prescriptions for
antidepressants and antipsychotics, and reports of alcohol abuse.
• One study found that loneliness was associated with a higher risk of CVD among patients with
diabetes.[100] Loneliness showed a weaker influence than kidney function, cholesterol, and BMI, but a
stronger influence than depression, smoking, physical activity, and diet.
metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (previously
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease)
• Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is considered to be an independent
risk factor for CVD.[101] [102] A nationwide longitudinal cohort study in Korea found that in patients
with type 2 diabetes, MASLD was associated with a higher risk of CVD and all-cause death.[103]
Weak
atrial fibrillation
• Coexisting atrial fibrillation in patients with diabetes is associated with an increased risk of diabetes-
related macrovascular complications, including a higher risk of all-cause mortality and CV mortality.[6]

• Can be considered to screen asymptomatic adults with diabetes for
heart failure.[29] If abnormal natriuretic peptide levels are detected,
echocardiography is recommended. Identification, risk stratification,
and early treatment of risk factors in people with diabetes and
asymptomatic stages of heart failure reduce the risk for progression
to symptomatic heart failure.[29]

failure and warrant
further assessment with
echocardiography
transthoracic doppler echocardiogram
• Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography with doppler
assessment at rest is a key diagnostic test in evaluation of chest pain
or shortness of breath as well as establishing the initial diagnosis
and cause of clinical heart failure.[140] Visualization of left and right
ventricular function and regional wall motion abnormalities allows for
the assessment of CAD risk and may help to guide clinical decision-
making. Performance of echocardiography at the bedside is ideal
for patients with acute chest pain and can be done using point-of-
care or handheld devices in institutions where such capabilities are
available.[29]

motion abnormalities may
indicate prior myocardial
infarction and the extent
of any impact on cardiac
function
exercise ECG
• Exercise ECG testing, with or without echocardiography, may be used
as an initial test for patients with cardiac symptoms plus abnormal
resting ECG.[29] It is suitable for patients who can exercise and who
have a resting ECG that is interpretable for ST-segment shifts.[141]
[142]
• Symptom-limited exercise ECG involves graded exercise until
physical fatigue, limiting chest pain, marked ischemia, or a drop
in blood pressure occurs. Candidates for exercise ECG are those:
a) without disabling comorbidity (e.g., frailty, marked obesity [body
mass index >40 kg/m²], peripheral artery disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, or orthopedic limitations) and capable of
performing exercise safely; and b) without ST-T abnormalities
on resting ECG (e.g., >0.5 mm ST depression, left ventricular
hypertrophy, paced rhythm, left bundle branch block, Wolff-
Parkinson-White pattern, or digoxin use).[142]
• There is a paucity of data on the predictive power of exercise testing
in patients with diabetes, but available data suggest that an ischemic
finding on exercise ECG is predictive of prognosis.[143] In a study
of 1282 patients (15% with diabetes), sensitivity (47% vs. 52%), and
specificity (81% vs. 80%) for exercise treadmill testing were similar in
people with and without diabetes.[144]
exercise-induced ST
depression or arrhythmia
exercise (stress) imaging test
• Patients with cardiac symptoms plus abnormal resting ECG who are
able to exercise should have an exercise stress test, with or without
imaging.[29] If imaging is used, the modality (either echocardiography
or nuclear scan [single-photon emission CT/PET) may depend on
availability.[141] [142] Stress echocardiography can be used to
define ischemia severity and for risk stratification purposes. Nuclear
imaging enables detection of perfusion abnormalities, measures

of left ventricular function, and high-risk findings, such as transient
ischemic dilation.[142]
pharmacologic (stress) imaging test
• Patients in whom stress testing is indicated, but who have resting
ECG abnormalities that preclude exercise stress testing (e.g.,
left bundle branch block, ventricular pacing) or who are unable
to exercise should undergo pharmacologic stress testing with
echocardiographic or nuclear (single-photon emission CT or PET)
imaging.[29] [141] [142] Stress echocardiography can be used to
define ischemia severity and for risk stratification purposes. Nuclear
imaging enables detection of perfusion abnormalities, measures
of left ventricular function, and high-risk findings, such as transient
ischemic dilation.[142]
reversible or irreversible
areas of decreased
perfusion
cardiac MRI or stress cardiac MRI
• In select patients, such as patients with diabetes with multivessel
disease and severe left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac MRI or stress
cardiac MRI can be useful.[145] These tests have the capability
to accurately assess global and regional left and right ventricular
function, detect and localize myocardial ischemia and infarction, and
determine myocardial viability, without the need for radiation.[142]
[145] They can also detect myocardial edema and microvascular
obstruction, which can help differentiate acute versus chronic
myocardial infarction, as well as other causes of acute chest pain,
including myocarditis.[142]
• However, do not recommend performing stress cardiac MRI in
patients with acute chest pain and high probability of CAD/ACS.[146]
 Stress cardiac MRI can increase risk and delay treatment in patients
with acute chest pain and markers of high risk, such as ST segment
elevation and/or positive cardiac biomarkers.[146]

ankle-brachial index (ABI)
• Joint American Heart Association and American College of
Cardiology guidelines recommend that all patients with history
or physical examination findings suggestive of peripheral arterial
disease (PAD) should have a resting ABI measured, with or without
ankle pulse volume recordings and/or Doppler waveforms.[28]
Screening with resting ABI is also considered reasonable in patients
with any of the following characteristics: age ≥65 years or older;
age 50 to 64 with risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., diabetes,
smoking history, dyslipidemia, hypertension), chronic kidney
disease, or family history of PAD; age <50 years with diabetes
and one additional risk factor for atherosclerosis; patients with
known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (e.g.,
coronary, carotid, subclavian, renal, mesenteric artery stenosis, or
abdominal aortic aneurysm).[28] The American Diabetes Association
recommends screening for PAD using ABI in asymptomatic people
with any of the following characteristics: age ≥50 years; diabetes
with duration ≥10 years; comorbid microvascular disease; clinical
evidence of foot complications; or any end-organ damage from
diabetes.[29]
• ABI may not be accurate in patients with noncompressible arteries,
such as those with long-standing diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney
disease (CKD), particularly those on dialysis. Diagnosis of PAD
should not be excluded based on normal or raised ankle brachial

CT coronary angiography
• CT angiography may be useful for patients with equivocal myocardial
perfusion scanning, for ruling out left main or triple-vessel coronary
artery disease (CAD), patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and
young patients undergoing valvular surgery.[148]
• Screening asymptomatic obstructive CAD among high-risk patients

not use CT angiography in high-risk emergency patients presenting
with acute chest pain.[150] [152]

CT coronary calcium scan
• Studies using ≥16-slice CT scanners have shown that coronary
artery calcium (CAC) score >400 is associated with high likelihood of
inducible myocardial ischemia and should prompt further testing.[147]
In patients with pretest likelihood of CAD <50%, a CAC score of 0
provides very strong evidence against the presence of CAD, with a
high degree of certainty.[148]
• Do not order a CAC scan in patients with known atherosclerotic
disease, including those with stents and bypass grafts, as it offers
limited incremental prognostic value for these individuals.[149][150]

Risk factors for diabetes include:[29]
• A history of diabetes in a first-degree relative
• Physical inactivity
• African-American, Latino, American-Indian, Asian-American, or Pacific Islander ancestry
• History of gestational diabetes
• Hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)
• Dyslipidemia (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <35 mg/dL [<0.90 mmol/L] and/or elevated
triglycerides >250 mg/dL [>2.82 mmol/L])
• Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
• Prediabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥5.7% [≥39 mmol/mol], impaired glucose tolerance [IGT] or
impaired fasting glucose [IFG])
• Polycystic ovary syndrome
• Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans)
Screening should also be considered in people on certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins,
thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications, and second-generation antipsychotic medications, as these agents
are known to increase the risk of diabetes.[29]
If results are normal, the ADA recommends that testing should be repeated at least every 3 years, with
consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status. People with prediabetes
(HbA1c ≥5.7% [≥39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly.[29]
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults
ages 35 to 70 years who have overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m² or ≥23 kg/m² for Asian-Americans) or obesity

(BMI ≥30 kg/m²).[166] Screening should be considered at an earlier age in patients from a population with
a disproportionately high prevalence of diabetes (American-Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hawaiian/Pacific
Islander, Hispanic/Latino).[166] Those with normal test results should be re-screened every 3 years.[166]
Those who have prediabetes should be referred to effective preventive interventions.[166]
Fasting plasma glucose, plasma glucose 2 hours after 75 g oral glucose, and HbA1c are all appropriate
screening tests.[29]
Screening for CVD in people with diabetes
Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors should be assessed at least annually in people with diabetes.[29] This
includes an assessment of:[29]
• Diabetes duration
• Weight
• Blood pressure
• Lipids
• Smoking status
• Family history of premature coronary disease
• Presence of albuminuria (indicator of chronic kidney disease)
One large cohort study found that in those with type 2 diabetes without existing CVD, increased albuminuria
levels were associated with higher risk of incident ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause
mortality.[79]
Based on the results of this screening, aggressive medical therapy to reduce CV risk is universally
recommended, which may include antihypertensive therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and, for those with
established or high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), antiplatelet therapy.[29] The American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association atherosclerotic CVD risk calculator should be used to aid with
overall CVD risk assessment and the 10-year risk for first CVD event.  [AHA/ACC: ASCVD risk calculator]
(http://static.heart.org/riskcalc/app/index.html#!/baseline-risk)  A European equivalent, known as SCORE2-
Diabetes, is recommended by the European Society of Cardiology for use in people ages 40 to 69 years with
type 2 diabetes.[6] When HbA1c values are added to CVD risk assessment models, there is little incremental
benefit for prediction of CV risk.[167]
While screening for CVD risk factors is important, the benefits of screening asymptomatic people with
diabetes for CAD remain unclear, and as such it is not recommended by the ADA.[29] One meta-analysis
suggested that systematic detection of silent ischemia in high-risk asymptomatic people with diabetes is
unlikely to provide any major benefit to clinically important outcomes compared with optimized medical
management of CV risk factors alone.[168] Another meta-analysis found that routine screening of
asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes for CAD neither reduced mortality nor reduced a composite of
nonfatal myocardial infarction and CV death.[169]
Investigations for CAD should be considered in the presence of any of the following:[29]
• Typical or atypical cardiac symptoms
• Abnormal resting ECG
• Signs and symptoms of associated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic
attack, stroke, claudication, or peripheral arterial disease[29]
Although screening asymptomatic patients for CAD is not recommended, screening for heart failure
with B natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal prohormone B-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels can be
considered.[29] If abnormal natriuretic peptide levels are detected, echocardiography is recommended.
Identification, risk stratification, and early treatment of risk factors in people with diabetes and asymptomatic
stages of heart failure have been shown to reduce the risk of progression to symptomatic heart failure.[29]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
Approach
Patients with diabetes benefit from aggressive cardiovascular (CV) risk factor management.[170] One large
prospective cohort study showed that patients with diabetes who met target ranges for hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), blood pressure (BP), albuminuria, and smoking had the same
or only slightly increased long-term mortality compared with nondiabetic controls.[171] However, in a large
US cohort study of patients with diabetes and known cardiovascular disease (CVD), only 6.9% received
guideline-recommended medical therapies for CV risk reduction.[172]
Therapeutic lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and aerobic exercise have been shown
in large clinical trials to improve glycemic, lipid, and BP control, in addition to insulin sensitivity and markers
of inflammation. They are also effective in achieving sustained weight loss and improvements in fitness.[47]
[71] [173] [174] [175] [176] The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends behavioral counseling
interventions to improve diet and increase physical activity for people with cardiometabolic risk factors to
prevent longer term CV events.[177]
Recommendations for the management of CVD and risk in patients with diabetes include:[29] [178]
• Therapeutic lifestyle interventions (medical nutrition therapy/dietary advice, physical activity, and
smoking cessation)
• Treatment for overweight or obesity
• Glycemic control
• BP control
• Dyslipidemia treatment
• Antiplatelet therapy
There is substantial evidence in support of the benefit of CV risk factor management in people with type
2 diabetes; however, robust evidence to support a comparable benefit in people with type 1 diabetes is
lacking. Current treatment guidelines extrapolate clinical trial evidence obtained in people with type 2
diabetes to provide similar treatment recommendations for people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
There is evidence, however, to support the more aggressive treatment of CV risk factors in people with type
1 diabetes, who would likely benefit from early risk stratification and comprehensive risk factor management,
including aggressive lipid-lowering therapy.[179]
Medical nutrition therapy
There is no ideal amount of macronutrients that people with diabetes should consume, and studies
suggest that such recommendations should be decided on an individual basis.[173] [180] The
Mediterranean Diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), vegetarian, and vegan diets have
all demonstrated some efficacy in people with diabetes.[173] [181] [182] [183] [184] European guidelines
recommend a Mediterranean or plant-based diet with high unsaturated fat content for lowering CV risk
in people with diabetes.[6] One meta-analysis found that red meat consumption was associated with
higher risk of CVD and diabetes, while another reported moderate certainty evidence that a shift from
animal-based to plant-based foods is beneficially associated with cardiometabolic health and all-cause
mortality.[185] [186]
Reducing overall carbohydrate intake has demonstrated some evidence for improving glycemia and
one study found that among people with type 2 diabetes, greater adherence to low-carbohydrate
diet patterns was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality.[187] However, the optimal
degree of carbohydrate restriction and long-term effects on CVD are still unclear.[29] Both World

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
MANAGEMENT
Health Organization (WHO) and European guidelines emphasize that carbohydrate quality, rather than
quantity, is key.[132] [188] The concept of carbohydrate quality refers to the nature and composition of
carbohydrates in a food or in the diet, including the proportion of sugars, how quickly polysaccharides
are metabolized and release glucose into the body (i.e., digestibility), and the amount of dietary fiber. It
is recommended that carbohydrate intake should come primarily from high-fiber foods, such as whole
grains, vegetables, whole fruits, and pulses.[132] [188] Diets high in naturally occurring fiber have been
shown to be protective against cardiometabolic disease and premature mortality.[132] When choosing
high-fiber foods, focus should be on minimally processed and largely intact whole grains, rather than
products with finely milled whole grains that may also have added sugars, sodium, and saturated
fats.[132] [188] Fiber-enriched foods and fiber supplements can be considered when sufficient intake
cannot be obtained from diet alone.[132]
There is some evidence to suggest that reducing intake of high glycemic index foods, and generally
reducing glycemic load, could be beneficial for preventing CVD; however, WHO guidelines do not make
any recommendations on this, noting that there was a lack of consistent benefit from diets with lower
glycemic index or glycemic load in observational studies, and little to no improvement in cardiometabolic
risk factors in randomized controlled trials associated with lower glycemic index and glycemic load.[188]
[189]
Replacing saturated fats and trans-fats with unsaturated fats and carbohydrates from foods containing
naturally occurring dietary fiber (such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and pulses) reduces LDL-
cholesterol (LDL-C) and also benefits CVD risk.[173] [190] [191] Saturated fat should comprise <10%
of total energy intake and trans-fats <1%.[132] [191] Dietary fats should mainly come from plant-based
foods high in mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, such as nuts, seeds, and nonhydrogenated nontropical
vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil, rapeseed/canola oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, linseed oil).[132]
People with diabetes who have overweight or obesity should be supported with evidence-based
nutritional support to achieve and maintain weight loss.[132] European guidelines recommend that a
variety of weight-loss diets can be used equally effectively, provided they can be followed and meet
recommendations for protein, fat, micronutrient, and fiber intake. Neither extreme high-carbohydrate,
nor very-low carbohydrate ketogenic diets are recommended, however.[132] One systematic umbrella
review of published meta-analyses of studies comparing hypoenergetic diets for weight management
in people with type 2 diabetes did not find evidence for any particular weight-loss diet over others (e.g.,
low-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-glycemic index, Mediterranean, high-monounsaturated fatty acid, or
vegetarian diets).[192]
Intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating as strategies for weight and glucose management have
gained popularity.[193] They have been shown to result in mild to moderate weight loss (3% to 8%
loss from baseline), but no significant difference in weight loss when compared with continuous calorie
restriction.[29] The ADA advises that due to its simplicity, intermittent fasting may lend itself as a useful
strategy for people with diabetes who are looking for practical eating management tools.[29] People
with diabetes who are on insulin and/or secretagogues should be medically monitored during the fasting
period.[29]
Evidence indicates that low- and very-low-energy diets (<3500 kJ/day [<840 kcal/day]), using total diet
replacement formula diet products (replacing all meals) or partial liquid meal replacement products
(replacing 1-2 meals per day) for the weight-loss phase, are most effective for weight loss and reduction
of other cardiometabolic risk factors when compared with the results from self-administered food-based
weight-loss diets.[132] [194] Low-energy nutritionally complete formula diets with a total diet replacement

induction phase also appear to be the most effective dietary approach for achieving type 2 diabetes
remission.[132] One population-based cohort study found that those who achieved remission from
diabetes, even for a short time, had a much lower risk of CVD events, including myocardial infarction (MI)
and stroke, as well macrovascular and microvascular complications.[195]
Physical activity
A sedentary lifestyle is a major risk factor for CVD.[68] [69] Many individuals with type 2 diabetes do not
meet the recommended exercise level per week.[29] [70]
Physical activity improves glycemic control, lipids, BP, insulin sensitivity, and markers of inflammation in
type 2 diabetes.[47] [71] [176] [196] Increased physical activity is associated with lower risk of CVD and
reduced all-cause mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.[47] [72] [122] [197]
At least 150 minutes per week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity is
recommended for adults with diabetes.[6] [29] The physical activity should be spread over at least 3 days
per week, with no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise.[29] Younger and more physically fit
individuals should aim for ≥75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity exercise or interval training.[29]
In the absence of contraindications, resistance training 2 to 3 times per week on nonconsecutive days
is also recommended.[6] [29] The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends interrupting
sedentary activity every 30 minutes with short bouts of physical activity.[29] Older adults may also benefit
from flexibility and balance exercise 2 to 3 times per week.[29]
The ADA recommends assessment of the following prior to starting an exercise program: age; physical
condition; BP; and presence or absence of autonomic neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy, balance
impairment, history of foot ulcers or Charcot foot, or untreated proliferative retinopathy.[29] The European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends that any exercise interventions be tailored according to a
patient’s frailty and diabetes-associated comorbidities such as retinopathy.[6] The European Association
of Preventive Cardiology recommends testing for silent myocardial ischemia prior to initiating an exercise
program in patients with type 2 diabetes and CVD, whereas the ADA states that clinical judgment should
be used in determining whether to screen asymptomatic individuals for coronary artery disease (CAD)
prior to recommending an exercise program.[29] [198]
Smoking cessation
All patients with diabetes should be advised not to smoke or to quit smoking.[29] Smoking counseling
and other forms of smoking cessation therapy should be incorporated into routine diabetes care.[29]
Varenicline combined with nicotine replacement therapy may be more effective than varenicline
alone.[199] The ADA does not support e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking or to facilitate smoking
cessation.[29]
Patients who quit smoking are prone to weight gain; therefore, it is important to have weight management
strategies in place to maximize the CV benefits of smoking cessation.[47]
Weight management
In most patients with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, ≥5% weight loss is recommended
through diet, physical activity, and behavioral therapy.[2] [29] The benefits of weight loss are progressive,
and so more intensive weight loss goals (i.e., 15%) may be useful to maximize benefit.[29]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
MANAGEMENT
Obesity pharmacotherapy should be considered as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions and behavioral
counseling to improve CV risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes who have overweight or obesity.[6]
[29] [178] For those with a BMI of ≥27 kg/m² (≥25 kg/m² for Asian-Americans) who are motivated to lose
weight, an initial 3-month trial of medication should be undertaken. When weight loss is <5% after 3
months, the benefits of ongoing treatment need to be balanced in the context of the glycemic response,
the availability of other potential treatment options, treatment tolerance, and overall treatment burden.[29]
The ADA advises that agents with both glucose-lowering and weight loss effects should be used first-
line; this includes glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the dual glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide.[29] Two phase 3 trials in adults with
obesity demonstrated mean losses of 15% to 21% of body weight with the highest dose of tirzepatide,
with adverse effects similar to those seen with GLP-1 receptor agonists.[200] [201] In the larger of the two
trials, over 80% of participants in all tirzepatide treatment groups lost ≥5% of body weight, compared with
35% of those assigned to placebo.[200] With higher body weight reduction, there were greater reductions
in HbA1c, triglycerides, waist circumference, and BP.[202] Tirzepatide is approved for chronic weight
management in adults with obesity or those who are overweight with at least one weight-related condition
(such as high BP, type 2 diabetes or high cholesterol), for use in addition to a reduced calorie diet and
increased physical activity.
If these medications are not tolerated or contraindicated, other obesity treatment approaches should be
considered, including phentermine, orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, or naltrexone/bupropion.[29]
The ESC recommends a GLP-1 receptor agonist or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor as
the agents of choice for glucose-lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes and overweight and obesity, in
view of their proven CV benefits for these patients.[6] [203]
For those not reaching goals, the ADA recommends evaluation of weight management therapies and
intensification of treatment with additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery, additional pharmacologic
agents, and structured lifestyle management programs).[29]
As well as considering specific medications to treat obesity, healthcare professionals should carefully
review the individual’s other medications and, whenever possible, minimize or provide alternatives
for medications that promote weight gain. Examples of medications associated with weight gain
include antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone), some antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic
antidepressants, some selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors),
glucocorticoids, injectable progestins, some anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), beta-blockers,
and possibly sedating antihistamines and anticholinergics.[29]
Metabolic (bariatric) surgery
A large number of studies have demonstrated that metabolic surgery achieves superior glycemic
management and reduction of CV risk in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity compared with
nonsurgical intervention.[9] [204] It has also been shown to reduce microvascular complications, cancer
risk, and all-cause mortality in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes.[29] [205] [206] [207] Of note, one
meta-analysis reported a 50% reduction in macrovascular complications following metabolic surgery in
patients with type 2 diabetes and extreme obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m²).[205] Another meta-analysis found that
metabolic surgery reduced the risk of any CV event by 44% and yielded a risk reduction of over 55% in
overall mortality and 69% in CV mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.[208]

Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most commonly
performed procedures. Both result in an anatomically smaller stomach pouch; in VSG, approximately 80%
of the stomach is removed, leaving behind a long, thin sleeve-shaped pouch, whereas RYGB creates a
much smaller stomach pouch (roughly the size of a walnut), which is then attached to the distal small
intestine, thereby bypassing the duodenum and jejunum.[29]
The ADA recommends metabolic surgery to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with BMI ≥30 kg/m² (≥27.5
kg/m² for Asian-Americans) who are otherwise good surgical candidates.[29] The ESC recommends
that metabolic surgery be considered for all patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥35 kg/m² who have
not achieved sufficient weight loss through lifestyle interventions and medication.[6] Metabolic surgery
is best done in a high-volume, specialized center to reduce the risk of perioperative and longer-term
complications.[29] For more comprehensive information, see Obesity in adults .
Long-term glycemic control
Increasing severity of hyperglycemia correlates with increasing CV risk.[47] [209] One meta-analysis
found that antihyperglycemic therapies reduce major adverse cardiac events in an HbA1c-dependent
manner.[210] However, three large studies, Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD),
Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE), and Veterans Administration Diabetes Trial (VADT),
found that very intensive glucose control (goal HbA1c <6.0% to 6.5% over 3-5 years) did not reduce
macrovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes.[6] [211] [212] [213] [214] In contrast, intensive
glycemic control appeared to have long-term beneficial effects on the risk of CVD in patients with type 1
diabetes.[215]
One meta-analysis found that intensive versus standard glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes
was associated with a reduced risk of nonfatal MI but no significant difference in the risk of major adverse
CV events or other adverse CV outcomes.[216] A long-term follow-up study of intensive glycemic control
(median HbA1c 6.9% vs. 8.4%) in type 2 diabetes did show fewer major CV events per 1000 person-
years, but there was no improvement in overall survival.[217] Furthermore, a follow-up of the ACCORD
trial, which studied intensive versus standard glycemic control (<6.0% vs. 7.0% to 7.9%), showed that
MI, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina were less frequent in the intensive group than the
standard therapy group.[218] The reasons for the discrepancy in study findings are unclear. It appears
that there may be a lag period before a benefit of glycemic control on CV risk is realized.[219] Other
possibilities that may have influenced results include the magnitude or rapidity of reductions in HbA1c
in intensively treated patients; effect of specific antihyperglycemic drugs or drug interactions; treatment-
related hypoglycemia; or age at which therapy is begun.[220]
The ADA recommends a general HbA1c goal of <7% (<53 mmol/mol) for nonpregnant adults with
diabetes to optimize clinical outcomes, although this should be individualized by the physician following
patient discussion.[29] If using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to assess glycemia, a
parallel goal is time in range >70%, with time below range <4% and time below 54 mg/dL (<3 mmol/
L) <1%.[29] Less stringent goals may be appropriate for: older adults; people with a history of severe
hypoglycemia; and those with limited life expectancies, advanced microvascular or macrovascular
complications, or comorbid conditions.[29] If using a CGM device, the ADA recommends a target of >50%
time in range with <1% time below range for those with frailty or at high risk of hypoglycemia.[29]
A person-centered shared decision-making approach should guide the choice of pharmacologic agents
for adults with type 2 diabetes, considering the effects on CV and renal comorbidities, effectiveness,
hypoglycemia risk, impact on weight, cost and access, risk of adverse reactions and tolerability, and

MANAGEMENT
individual preferences.[29] Medication plan and medication-taking behavior should be reevaluated
at regular intervals (the ADA suggest 3 to 6 monthly) and treatment intensification, deintensification,
or modification - as appropriate - for people not meeting individualized treatment goals should not be
delayed.[29]
US and European guidelines continue to recommend metformin as the first-line treatment for
glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of the presence or absence of established
atherosclerotic CVD.[29] [221] [222] Evidence for the CV benefit of metformin is limited; however, it
does not cause weight gain or hypoglycemia, and is widely available relative to other agents.[47] People
who are unable to take metformin due to contraindications or intolerance can either use an alternative
noninsulin agent or start insulin therapy. The ADA recommends a GLP-1 receptor agonist over insulin
when possible.[29]
Early combination therapy can be considered in adults with type 2 diabetes at treatment initiation to
shorten time to attainment of individualized treatment goals.[29] When selecting an additional therapy,
clinicians should consider the evidence of benefits, harms, patient burden, and cost of medications in
addition to performing an individualized assessment of each patient’s preferences, glycemic control
target, comorbid conditions, and risk for symptomatic hypoglycemia.[222] The American College of
Physicians (ACP) now recommends that SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists should be the add-
on therapy of choice for patients with inadequate glycemic control.[222] It advises that sulfonylureas and
long-acting insulins are inferior to these medications in reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity but
may still have some limited value for glycemic control. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are not
recommended as an add-on to metformin and lifestyle modifications in light of high-certainty evidence
showing that this does not reduce morbidity or all-cause mortality.[222]
When considering glycemic control in patients who have overweight or obesity, the ADA recommends
that healthcare professionals should prioritize glucose-lowering medications with a beneficial effect
on weight.[29] One meta-analysis found that when glucose-lowering therapies were associated with
weight loss, the risk of mortality was reduced by 22% for each 1% reduction in HbA1c.[223] In addition,
concomitant reductions in HbA1c and body weight were associated with a significantly lower risk of
mortality and vascular events.
• Agents associated with clinically meaningful weight loss include GLP-1 receptor agonists,
tirzepatide, SGLT2 inhibitors, metformin, and amylin analogs.[29] One network meta-analysis of
531 trials with 279,118 participants confirmed that tirzepatide is the most effective drug for reducing
body weight (mean reduction 8.57 kg), followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors,
and metformin.[224] DPP-4 inhibitors, bromocriptine (a centrally acting dopamine agonist), alpha-
glucosidase inhibitors, and bile acid sequestrants are considered weight neutral.[29]
• Insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas and meglitinides), thiazolidinediones, and insulin are often
associated with weight gain.[29]
See Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults  and Type 1 diabetes mellitus  for further information.
Antihyperglycemic agents with cardiovascular and renal benefit
For patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, significant CVD risk factors, established heart failure
(with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction), or established chronic kidney disease (CKD), addition
of a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a SGLT2 inhibitor is strongly recommended (independent of HbA1c) to
reduce the risk of adverse CV or kidney events.[29] [161] [225]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
• The ADA and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) advise that for patients in
whom atherosclerotic CVD predominates (e.g., previous MI, unstable angina, ischemic stroke, or
indicators of high CV risk present) either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or an SGLT2 inhibitor can be
used.[29] [221] While definitions of what constitutes high CV risk vary, most comprise ≥55 years of
age with two or more additional risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia,
or albuminuria.[221] Guidelines published by the ACP and American Heart Association (AHA)/
American Stroke Association specify that GLP-1 receptor agonists should be prioritized in patients
with an increased risk for stroke.[118] [222]
• For those patients in whom heart failure or CKD predominates, SGLT2 inhibitors should be
favored.[29] [221] [222]
• Combination therapy with a GLP-1 receptor agonist and an SGLT2 inhibitor may be appropriate
for some patients to provide additive reduction in risk of adverse CV and kidney outcomes (e.g., if
HbA1c remains above target and the patient is taking either an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor
agonist).[29]
SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to reduce CV events and mortality in
outcome trials and in real-world studies, regardless of baseline HbA1c values and concurrent use of
CV medications.[47] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] One Cochrane meta-analysis
concluded that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce CVD and all-cause mortality
with high certainty.[235] High-certainty evidence supported use of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce risk of
hospitalization for heart failure, with moderate-certainty evidence supporting use of GLP-1 receptor
agonists to reduce fatal and nonfatal stroke.[235] Another meta-analysis found that in patients with type
2 diabetes, the hypotensive effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists were significantly
associated with a reduction in mortality and cardiorenal events, suggesting that this BP-lowering effect
could be seen as an additive indicator of the CV protective effects of these agents.[236]
SGLT inhibitors
• SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse CV events, progression of
CKD, and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure.[222] [237] [238] They have been shown
to improve CV outcomes in patients with heart failure regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction,
and irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.[224] [239] [240] [241] [242] [243] [244] [245] [246]
• The SGLT2 inhibitors with the strongest evidence for CVD risk reduction are dapagliflozin,
canagliflozin, and empagliflozin.[120] [221] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] Only
empagliflozin and canagliflozin have shown reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in
patients with type 2 diabetes.[254]
• CV outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes:
• The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial evaluated CV outcomes with empagliflozin in patients
with established CVD. Empagliflozin was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of the
primary composite outcome of 3-point MACE (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and CV mortality;
MACE-3) and unexpectedly yielded a 35% relative risk reduction in hospitalization for
heart failure. All-cause mortality was also significantly reduced by 32% compared with
placebo.[252]
• Similar findings were seen for canagliflozin in the CANVAS Program trial.[253] [255]
• The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial found that dapagliflozin did not significantly reduce MACE-3,
but resulted in a 27% reduction in heart failure-related hospitalization compared with
placebo.[120] However, it decreased CV outcomes in a subanalysis of the primary trial
confined to participants with prior MI.[256]

MANAGEMENT
• In the VERTIS-CV trial, ertugliflozin was not found to be superior to placebo in reducing
MACE-3 or CV mortality; however, a significant reduction in heart failure hospitalizations was
reported in the ertugliflozin arm.[257] [258]
• The CREDENCE trial primarily evaluated kidney-related outcomes with canagliflozin and
found a significant 31% reduction in the secondary composite outcome of CV death and
heart failure hospitalizations with canagliflozin compared to placebo.[248]
• One pooled meta-analysis of these trials revealed a significant reduction in MACE (most
apparent in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD), all-cause mortality, CV deaths,
and heart failure hospitalizations. The greatest magnitude of benefit was for reduction in risk
for hospitalization for heart failure and kidney disease progression.[259]
• On the basis of these findings, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in the management of heart
failure, regardless of diabetes status.[161] [260] [261] SGLT inhibitors, particularly empagliflozin,
have been shown to significantly reverse cardiac remodeling in patients with heart failure.[262]
[263] [264] [265] [266]
• One meta-analysis looked at the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in older people with type 2 diabetes
and heart failure and found they were associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality,
cardiac death, and hospitalization for heart failure, confirming that their cardioprotective advantages
extend to the frail/older population. However, they did not demonstrate a significant effect in
reducing the risk of macrovascular events (acute coronary syndrome [ACS] or stroke).[267]
• The ESC recommends dapagliflozin or empagliflozin for all patients with type 2 diabetes and
CKD to reduce risk of heart failure hospitalization or CV death, regardless of whether they have a
preexisting heart failure diagnosis.[261]
• SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce the risk of serious hyperkalemia in people with type 2 diabetes at
high CV risk without increasing the risk of hypokalemia, allowing the titration of guideline-directed
medical therapy in patients with heart failure.[268]
• An initial decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is commonly observed after
initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor but this decline is not associated with subsequent risk of CV or kidney
events.[269] Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors should not be interrupted or discontinued in response to an
initial eGFR decline.
• SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated; however, some serious adverse reactions have been
documented, including a higher rate of diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, fracture, and/or
amputation. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) warns of the potential increased risk of toe
amputation.[270] The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that the risk of amputation, while
increased with canagliflozin, is lower than previously described, particularly when appropriately
monitored.[271] One large network meta-analysis estimated that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors
in 1000 patients for 5 years probably results in three additional amputations.[224] The FDA
and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warn of cases of
necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (also known as Fournier gangrene) observed in post-marketing
surveillance of SGLT2 inhibitors.[272] [273] Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors should be avoided in patients
with conditions that increase the risk for limb amputations, and in patients prone to urinary tract or
genital infections.
• Sotagliflozin is the first dual SGLT inhibitor.[274] It inhibits both renal SGLT2 (promoting significant
excretion of glucose in the urine, in the same way as other already available SGLT2 selective
inhibitors) and intestinal SGLT1 (delaying glucose absorption and therefore reducing postprandial
glucose).[274] It has been approved in people with heart failure (both with and without diabetes)
and in patients with type 2 diabetes who have CKD or high risk of/established CVD, to reduce the
risk of hospitalization for heart failure.[29] The approval was based on two randomized, double-

blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 CV outcome trials: SOLOIST-WHF (Effects of Sotagliflozin on
Clinical Outcomes in Hemodynamically Stable Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post Worsening
Heart Failure) and SCORED (Effects of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular and Renal Events in
Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Moderately Impaired Renal
Function).[275] [276] It is not currently approved for glycemic management of type 1 or type 2
diabetes.
• One concern with expanded use of SGLT inhibition is the infrequent but serious risk of diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA), including the atypical presentation of euglycemic ketoacidosis.[29] Of note,
the studies that led to the approved indication of sotagliflozin for heart failure excluded individuals
with type 1 diabetes or a history of DKA.[275] [276] In clinical trials of sotagliflozin in people with
type 1 diabetes, results showed improvements in HbA1c and body weight; however, its use was
associated with an eightfold increase in DKA compared with placebo.[29] [277] The risks and
benefits of SGLT inhibitors in this population continue to be evaluated, with consensus statements
providing guidance on patient selection and precautions.[29] [278]
GLP-1 receptor agonists
• Reduce the risk for all-cause mortality and major adverse CV events.[222] [279] The GLP-1
receptor agonists with the strongest evidence for atherosclerotic CVD risk reduction are injectable
semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide.[221] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284]
• In addition to their beneficial effects on coronary artery disease, GLP-1 receptor agonists are the
only drug class that has been shown to convincingly reduce non-fatal stroke.[222] [224] [285] [286]
[287] [288]
• The addition of semaglutide to standard care has been shown to be associated with an important
gain in life-years free of new/recurrent CVD events and a decrease in 10-year CVD risk.[289] It is
the only GLP-1 receptor agonist that is available in both oral and injectable formulations. However,
unlike for injectable semaglutide, conclusive evidence for the CV benefit of oral semaglutide has
not yet been established in clinical studies.[281] For more information on oral semaglutide, see
Emerging treatments .
• Unlike for SGLT2 inhibitors, the evidence for GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing heart failure or
improving CV outcomes in patients with heart failure has been inconsistent across trials.[290] One
meta-analysis found that they may prevent new-onset heart failure and mortality in patients with
type 2 diabetes; however, they did not reduce heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in those
patients with preexisting heart failure.[291]
• Data from retrospective studies and meta-analyses have shown superiority of GLP-1 receptor
agonists in comparison with other antidiabetic medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4
inhibitors in terms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).[292] However, data from CV outcome trials
regarding the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on PAD are scarce and further prospective studies
are needed.
• The most common adverse effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are gastrointestinal, particularly
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; these are frequent but tend to reduce over time.[293]
• Patients should be counseled about potential for ileus.[29]
• An association with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer has been reported in clinical trials, but
causality has not been established; after a review of available data, the FDA and the EMA agreed
that there was insufficient evidence to confirm an increased risk of pancreatic cancer with use of
GLP-1-based therapies.[294] Nonetheless, GLP-1 receptor agonists should be used with caution in
patients with a history of pancreatitis.[29] [293]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
MANAGEMENT
• GLP-1 receptor agonists have been associated with increased risk of gallbladder and biliary
diseases including cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.[293]
• Hypoglycemia risk is increased with concomitant sulfonylureas and insulin use. Treatment
deintensification of these agents or of diuretics, particularly in older and frail individuals, is
recommended to avoid hypoglycemia and hypovolemia.[293]
• DKA has been reported in patients on a combination of a GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin,
when concomitant insulin was either rapidly reduced or discontinued; insulin reductions
should therefore be undertaken in a cautious stepwise manner, with capillary blood glucose
monitoring.[293]
• In rodent studies, GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with medullary thyroid cancer, resulting
in a black box warning for these agents in patients with a personal or family history of multiple
endocrine neoplasia type 2 or medullary thyroid cancer; however, there is conflicting evidence as to
whether this risk applies in humans.[293] [295] [296] [297] [298]
• The EMA is reviewing data on the risk of suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm with
GLP-1 receptor agonists, following reports of such occurrences in people using liraglutide and
semaglutide.[299]
• There is some concern that GLP1-receptor agonists, through their rapid glucose-lowering effects,
may increase the risk of transient worsening of preexisting diabetic retinopathy.[300] [301] [302]
Further studies are required to elucidate this relationship.
One Swedish nationwide study found that the proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes who were eligible
for treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist was approximately 80% according to
the 2019 ESC guidelines and around 50% according to the 2019 ADA/EASD consensus report. Uptake
of these recommendations in routine clinical practice was limited, however, indicating that many eligible
patients are missing out on the therapeutic benefits of these medications.[303]
Glycemic control during acute critical illness (CVD events or
interventions)
Trials of tight glycemic control in critically ill patients have yielded mixed results.[304] [305]
In one study of patients with acute coronary syndrome who presented with hyperglycemia, intensive
glucose control was associated with harm and did not reduce infarct size.[306]
One large RCT raised questions about intensive blood glucose targets for inpatient glycemic control and
found a lower mortality for intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a blood glucose target of 180 mg/dL (10
mmol/L) than for those with a blood glucose target of 81 to 108 mg/dL (4.5 to 6.0 mmol/L).[307] A concern
has been whether there is any additional benefit to lowering blood glucose levels below about 140 to 180
mg/dL (7.8 to 10 mmol/L) in the ICU setting.[308]
The ADA recommends that in critically ill patients, insulin therapy should be started for persistent
hyperglycemia ≥180 mg/dL (≥10 mmol/L) (tested on two occasions).[29] Once insulin therapy is started,
a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8 to 10 mmol/L) is recommended for most patients.[29]
More stringent goals, such as 110 to 140 mg/dL (6.1 to 7.8 mmol/L), may be appropriate for selected
patients (e.g., critically ill postsurgical patients or patients with cardiac surgery), as long as they can
be achieved without significant hypoglycemia.[29] Critically ill patients require an intravenous insulin
protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety for achieving targets without increasing risk for severe
hypoglycemia.[29]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
Intravenous infusion of insulin allows for more rapid titration (and more reliable absorption) in critically ill
patients than does subcutaneous injection. In the perioperative period for coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG), good glucose control may reduce infectious complications, such as sternal wound infections and
mediastinitis, cardiac mortality caused by pump failure, and the risk of supraventricular tachycardia.[309]
[310] [311]
BP control
It is well accepted that BP control reduces CV risk in patients with diabetes; however, certain pivotal
studies investigating the benefits of intensive versus standard BP control yielded discordant results:
• The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) found that tight BP control (<150 mmHg) led to a
greater reduction in CV events than less tight BP control (<180 mmHg).[58]
• The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) had similar findings, with intensive BP
control (<120 mmHg) significantly reducing risk of CV events compared with standard control (<140
mmHg), although patients with diabetes were excluded from enrollment.[57]
• Conversely, the ACCORD-BP trial demonstrated that intensive BP control to a goal of <120 mmHg
compared with a standard BP goal of <140 mmHg did not change CV outcomes in patients with
diabetes.[56]
• The 2021 STEP trial found that, in older adults ages 60-80 years with hypertension, intensive BP
control (target 110 to <130 mmHg) was associated with a 26% reduction in CV events compared
with less intensive BP control (target 130 to <150 mmHg).[59]
The reason for the difference in findings between SPRINT and ACCORD-BP remains under debate.
However, a post-hoc analysis of ACCORD-BP found that although dual intensive therapy for BP and
glycemic control was detrimental, intensive BP control conferred modest CV benefits for patients on
standard glycemic control.[312]
There is a lack of high-quality evidence regarding optimal treatment of hypertension in people with
diabetes.[60] However, guidelines recommend a BP treatment goal of <130/80 mmHg, providing this can
be safely attained.[6] [29][60] [61] The departure in the guidelines from the previous BP target of <140/90
mmHg was in response to studies like the meta-analysis of data from the ACCORD-BP and SPRINT
trials, which showed a reduction in a composite of unstable angina, MI, acute heart failure, stroke, and
CV death with intensive systolic BP targets of <120 mmHg compared with the traditional target of <140
mmHg.[313] Notably, the ADA recommends an individualized approach to BP targets, and recommends
that patients and clinicians should engage in a shared decision-making process to determine individual
BP targets, acknowledging that the benefits and risks of intensive BP targets are uncertain.[29]
People with diabetes plus hypertension should monitor their BP at home in addition to having it checked
at regular intervals in the clinic setting, both to ensure accuracy of readings and to encourage adherence
to treatment regimens.[29]
Guidelines also emphasize the importance of therapeutic lifestyle interventions in the management of
hypertension; these include increased physical activity, weight management, a DASH-style eating pattern
(including reduced sodium intake and increased potassium intake), moderation of alcohol intake, smoking
cessation, and education to support long-term behavior change.[29] [61] These lifestyle interventions
should be initiated alongside pharmacologic therapy when hypertension is diagnosed, and are also
recommended for individuals with diabetes and mildly elevated blood pressure (systolic >120 mmHg or
diastolic >80 mmHg).[29]

MANAGEMENT
The ADA recommends starting one antihypertensive agent for patients with initial BP ≥130/80 mmHg and
<150/90 mmHg, and starting two antihypertensive agents for those with initial BP ≥150/90 mmHg.[29]
ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide
diuretics are all options for initial antihypertensive therapy.[29] [60] [61]
For patients with diabetes who have CAD or CKD and/or albuminuria (eGFR <60 mL/minute/1.73 m²,
urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g creatinine), initial antihypertensive therapy should be with an
ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist if an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated (a dose reduction
may be required in patients with renal impairment).[29] [60]
For those whose BP is >150/90 mmHg, a calcium-channel blocker or thiazide diuretic should be
considered in addition at treatment initiation.[29] Combining ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II
receptor antagonists is not recommended because of an increased risk for acute kidney injury and
hyperkalemia.[29] [314] ACE inhibitors have also shown increased risk for hypoglycemia in conjunction
with insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or meglitinide).[315]
One meta-analysis found that ACE inhibitors reduced mortality and major CV events in patients with
diabetes, while angiotensin-II receptor antagonists did not improve these outcomes. Neither ACE
inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists were found to reduce the risk of stroke.[316] Another
meta-analysis showed that in patients with diabetes and kidney disease, no antihypertensive regimen
improved survival. However, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists were effective in
preventing end-stage renal disease.[314] Some antihyperglycemic agents have demonstrated modest
BP-lowering effects in clinical trials, including SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.[317]
Further studies are warranted to investigate the effects of these agents on BP as the primary outcome
measure.[317]
Based on the Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardio-Renal Endpoints (ALTITUDE) trial, the
FDA recommends that combination of the renin inhibitor aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-
II receptor antagonists is contraindicated in patients with diabetes due to the risk of renal impairment,
hypotension, and hyperkalemia.  [FDA: new warning and contraindication for blood pressure medicines
containing aliskiren (Tekturna)] (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-
communication-new-warning-and-contraindication-blood-pressure-medicines-containing)
Beta-blockers may be appropriate to improve outcomes as antihypertensive agents in patients with prior
MI, active angina, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, or heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction.[29] These patients are typically started on beta-blockers alone, with other antihypertensive
therapies added as needed. If a beta-blocker is indicated, an agent should be selected that has
concomitant vasodilatory effects to reduce potential for adverse metabolic impact.[114] Beta-blockers
may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and also have the potential to exacerbate hypoglycemic episodes,
particularly when used concurrently with sulfonylureas.[29] [318] [319]
Multiple drug therapy is often required in order to achieve antihypertensive targets.[29] If BP remains
uncontrolled on monotherapy, add an agent from a different first-line class.[29] If BP remains uncontrolled
despite combination therapy with first-line agents (i.e., three classes of antihypertensive medication
[including a diuretic] plus lifestyle modifications), discontinue or minimize interfering substances such
as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, evaluate for secondary causes of hypertension (including
obstructive sleep apnea), and consider the addition of an aldosterone antagonist (e.g., spironolactone,
eplerenone).[29] [114] Referral to a hypertension specialist may also be necessary.[29] [114]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
Serum creatinine/eGFR and potassium should be checked within 7-14 days of initiation of treatment
with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, aldosterone antagonist, or diuretic, as well as
following uptitration of dose and then at least annually.[29]
European and US guidelines also recommend considering use of an ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-
II receptor antagonist) in patients with chronic coronary disease and diabetes mellitus to reduce risk of
cardiovascular events, regardless of hypertension, and particularly in patients with heart failure or CKD.[6]
[320] [321]
Dyslipidemia therapy
Lifestyle modification focusing on weight loss (if indicated); application of a Mediterranean or DASH eating
pattern; reduction of saturated fat and trans fat; increase of dietary omega-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber, and
plant stanol/sterol intake; and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid
profile and reduce the risk of developing CVD in people with diabetes.[29]
LDL-C is the most extensively studied modifiable risk factor associated with atherosclerotic CVD. There
is strong evidence that LDL-C is a causal factor in the pathophysiology of CVD, and CVD risk reduction
is proportional to the absolute and relative LDL-C reduction achieved.[112] One meta-analysis which
included data from over 18,000 people with diabetes from 14 randomized trials of statin therapy (mean
follow-up 4.3 years) demonstrated a 9% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality and 13% reduction in
vascular mortality for each 39 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in LDL-C.[124] The CV benefit did not depend
on baseline LDL-C levels and was linearly related to the LDL-C reduction without a low threshold beyond
which there was no benefit observed. Lowering of LDL-C has also been shown to have a significant
positive impact on long-term outcomes for patients with diabetes and coronary heart disease undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).[322]
For patients with diabetes and established CVD, both European and US guidelines recommend an LDL-C
goal of <55 mg/dL (<1.42 mmol/L) and at least a 50% reduction from baseline.[6] [29] [113]
Statins
Statins are the first-line medication for LDL-C lowering and cardioprotection.[29] Moderate-intensity statin
therapy has been defined by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA as therapy that generally
lowers LDL-C level by 30% to 50%, while high-intensity statin therapy lowers it by ≥50%.[113] Guidelines
recommend high-intensity statin therapy in adults of all ages with diabetes and atherosclerotic CVD, to
target an LDL-C reduction of ≥50% from baseline and an LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dL (<1.42 mmol/L).[29]
[113] Low-dose statin therapy is generally not recommended in people with diabetes, but it is sometimes
the only dose of statin that an individual can tolerate; for individuals who do not tolerate the intended
intensity of statin, the maximum tolerated statin dose should be used.[29]
Ezetimibe
If target LDL-C is not achieved with a statin alone, addition of ezetimibe can be considered.[29] Ezetimibe
works by reducing cholesterol absorption from the ileum.[6] One large RCT of 18,144 individuals
compared the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin therapy versus simvastatin alone in people ages ≥50
years who had experienced a recent acute coronary syndrome.[323] Overall, over an average treatment
period of 6 years, addition of ezetimibe led to a 6.4% relative benefit and a 2% absolute reduction in
major adverse atherosclerotic CV events, with the degree of benefit being directly proportional to the
change in LDL-C. Subgroup analysis showed that the benefit of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy was

enhanced in patients with diabetes.[323] Another RCT showed that among patients with diabetes and
atherosclerotic CVD, moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combined therapy was noninferior to high-
intensity statin monotherapy with respect to the primary endpoint of CV death, major CV events, or
nonfatal stroke.[324] Notably, the patients treated with moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe had lower
rates of drug discontinuation or dose reduction than patients receiving high-intensity statin. This study
supports moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy as a suitable alternative to high-
intensity statins if the latter cannot be tolerated, or further reduction in LDL-C is required among patients
with diabetes and CVD.[324]
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors
If target LDL-C is not achieved with a statin alone, addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor (e.g., alirocumab,
evolocumab) can be considered as an alternative to ezetimibe (or in addition to ezetimibe if LDL-C is not
at goal). PCSK9 inhibitors can also be used as monotherapy in patients who are statin-intolerant.[29]
In placebo-controlled RCTs, alirocumab and evolocumab achieved a >50% reduction in LDL-C levels
compared with placebo, with a 15% lower risk of ischemic CV events over a 2- to 3-year follow-up.[325]
[326]
Bempedoic acid
Bempedoic acid, an adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase inhibitor, is a novel, oral LDL-C-lowering drug
that works by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis.[6] It is approved in the US as an adjunct to diet and
maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with established atherosclerotic CVD who
require additional lowering of LDL-C. The ADA advises that it may be considered for patients who cannot
use, or tolerate, other evidence-based LDL-C-lowering approaches, or for whom those other therapies are
inadequately effective.[29] Bempedoic acid is also approved for this indication in Europe.[327] One meta-
analysis found that bempedoic acid therapy lowered LDL-C levels by about 23% compared with placebo,
while an RCT found that it was associated with a reduction in risk of major adverse CV events (death
from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization) in statin-intolerant patients,
providing some evidence for its use in this group.[328] [329]
Inclisiran
Inclisiran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that inhibits hepatic synthesis of PCSK9, is now
recommended by the ADA as an alternative lipid-lowering treatment for people who are intolerant of
statins (off-label use).[29] In the ORION-10 and ORION-11 phase 3 trials, individuals with established
CVD or at high risk of CVD were randomized to receive inclisiran or placebo.[330] Inclisiran allows less
frequent administration compared with monoclonal antibodies and was administered on day 1, day 90,
and every 6 months thereafter over a period of 540 days. Reductions in LDL-C levels of approximately
50% were obtained with inclisiran.[330] Adverse events were generally similar in the inclisiran and
placebo groups, although injection-site adverse events were more frequent with inclisiran (2.6% vs. 0.9%
in ORION-10 and 4.7% vs. 0.5% in ORION-11); such reactions were generally mild.[330] A CV outcome
trial using inclisiran in people with established CVD is currently ongoing.[331]
Summary of ADA recommendations for lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in patients with diabetes with
established CVD:[29]
• High-intensity statin therapy for adults of all ages, to target an LDL-C reduction of ≥50% from
baseline and an LDL-C goal of <55 mg/dL (<1.42 mmol/L). For people who do not tolerate the
intended statin intensity, the maximum tolerated statin dose should be used.

therapy.
• For people intolerant of statin therapy, a PCSK9 inhibitor, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran should be
considered as alternative cholesterol-lowering therapies.
For certain patients at intermediate or borderline risk, coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement may
be useful to support shared decision-making for statin therapy.[76] A CAC score ≥100 Agatston units or in
the ≥75th age/sex/race percentile can reclassify CV risk as being increased.[76]
A lipid profile should be checked: at time of diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes; at initiation of statins or
other lipid-lowering therapy; 4-12 weeks after initiation or a change in dose; and annually thereafter.[29]
Role of other lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies
• Icosapent ethyl can be considered in patients with atherosclerotic CVD or other CV risk factors
who are on a statin and have controlled LDL-C but elevated triglycerides (135 to 499 mg/dL [1.53
to 5.64 mmol/L]).[29] It has been shown to modestly reduce CV events.[114] [115] There have
been some concerns about the use of mineral oil as the control treatment in pivotal clinical trials
of icosapent ethyl; however, evaluation of whether this had an impact on trial outcomes remains
inconclusive.[332] [333]
• Fibrates are effective for lowering very high triglyceride levels (i.e., >500 mg/dL [>5.65 mmol/L]) to
reduce the risk of pancreatitis.[114] They are most often added to statin therapy, although the ADA
notes that this approach is generally not recommended due to a lack of evidence of improvement
in CVD outcomes.[29] Furthermore, caution is recommended as combination statin and fibrate
therapy can increase the risk of myositis and rhabdomyolysis. To lower the risk, fenofibrate is
recommended over gemfibrozil.[47]
• Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has not been found to reduce the rate of CV events in
patients with diabetes at high risk for these events.[116]
Antiplatelet therapy
• Aspirin is recommended for secondary prevention in those with a history of atherosclerotic
CVD.[29]
• Clopidogrel (a P2Y12 inhibitor) should be used in patients who have an aspirin allergy or
intolerance.[29]
• In people with stable coronary and/or peripheral artery disease and low bleeding risk, the ADA
and ESC recommend combination treatment with aspirin and low-dose rivaroxaban (a direct oral
anticoagulant) for secondary prevention.[29] [334] Rivaroxaban has similar antiplatelet effects to
aspirin, and may also improve endothelial function.[335]
• Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or
prasugrel) is indicated after ACS.[336] Evidence supports use of either ticagrelor or clopidogrel
if no PCI was performed and clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel if PCI was performed.[29] [337]
 Generally, prasugrel and ticagrelor have better efficacy in patients with diabetes and are preferred
to clopidogrel for patients who undergo PCI.[334] [337]
• Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy is also recommended after high-risk transient ischemic attack
(TIA) and minor stroke.[338]
• Dual antiplatelet therapy may have benefit beyond 1 year in reducing long-term risk of recurrent
atherosclerotic events.[334] However, recommendations regarding length of treatment are
rapidly evolving and should be determined by an interprofessional team approach that includes
a cardiologist following ACS or a neurologist following TIA/stroke.[29] The benefits versus risk of

bleeding and thrombosis should be evaluated based on the coronary anatomy and extent of CAD,
PCI complexity, bleeding risk, age, and patient’s medical comorbidities such as anemia or renal
failure.[339]
• To reduce risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, a proton-pump inhibitor is recommended for all patients
on a combination of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, and the ESC recommends that one
should be considered for those on a single agent depending on their individual bleeding risk.[6]
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
For people with STEMI and ischemic symptoms for <12 hours, primary PCI is recommended to improve
survival.[337] Primary PCI is superior to fibrinolytic therapy, and fibrinolytic therapy is therefore only
recommended if PCI is not immediately available (i.e., within 120 minutes).[337] An analysis of data from
11 clinical trials compared PCI with fibrinolytic therapy in 2725 patients with STEMI, including 367 patients
with diabetes.[340] Among the patients with diabetes, 30-day mortality or nonfatal reinfarction rate was
19.3% for those treated with fibrinolytics and 9.2% for those who underwent primary PCI. If onset of
ischemic symptoms is ≥12 hours and the patient is in cardiogenic shock or experiencing hemodynamic
instability, primary PCI is indicated, or CABG if PCI is not feasible.[337] PCI may also be reasonable in
patients who are stable and presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, as well as in those whose
STEMI is complicated by ongoing ischemia, acute severe heart failure, or life-threatening arrhythmia.[337]
For more comprehensive information on the acute management of this condition, see ST-elevation
myocardial infarction .
Uncontrolled blood glucose levels in the perioperative or periprocedural period are associated with
adverse outcomes for patients with diabetes. Benefits of good control include reductions in length of
hospital stay and likelihood of readmission, as well as improved postoperative survival rates.[29] One
RCT examining the effects of periprocedural intensive glycemic control during early PCI on the rate
of restenosis in hyperglycemic (glucose ≥140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) patients with a STEMI showed that
intensive control led to a 50% reduction in restenosis at 6 months compared with conventional glycemic
control.[341]
Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome
Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) most commonly manifests as non-STEMI
(NSTEMI) but may also present as unstable angina.[152]
Immediate invasive strategy (coronary angiography with intent of revascularization) is required in patients
with NSTEMI and cardiogenic shock, refractory angina, or hemodynamic/electrical instability.[337] Early
invasive strategy (usually within 24 hours) is recommended for patients at high risk for CV events: for
example, those with a high Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score. Patients with low-
or intermediate-risk NSTEMI should undergo coronary angiography before discharge with the intent of
revascularization. Invasive strategy is important in NSTEMI as it will help determine the suitability for
revascularization and the appropriate mode (PCI vs. CABG).[337]
For more comprehensive information on the acute management of these conditions, see Non-ST-
elevation myocardial infarction  and Unstable angina .
Revascularization for left main or multivessel disease
Recommendations on the mode of revascularization in patients with diabetes differ slightly from those
for the general population, particularly for patients with diabetes and multivessel disease.[342] Patients

with diabetes and complex multivessel CAD should undergo a heart team approach to revascularization,
inclusive of an interventional cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon.[337]
CABG is generally recommended in preference to PCI to improve survival in patients with diabetes with
multivessel CAD for which mechanical revascularization is likely to improve survival.[337] [343] [344] This
is particularly recommended if a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery (LIMA-
LAD) graft is used and the patient is a good surgical candidate. In patients with diabetes and multivessel
CAD who are poor surgical candidates, meet the criteria for revascularization, and have anatomy that
is amenable to PCI, PCI can be beneficial to improve ischemic outcomes.[337] The survival benefit
associated with CABG compared with PCI may be greater in patients with diabetes receiving insulin
therapy than in those not receiving insulin therapy.[345]
The 2021 ACC/AHA/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) guidelines
recommend CABG for left main disease.[337] However, they recognize that PCI might be considered
in patients with low- or intermediate-complexity CAD in the rest of the coronary anatomy.[337] One trial
(EXCEL; about 30% participants with diabetes) found that PCI was noninferior to CABG for the end point
of MI, stroke, or mortality at 3 years.[346] Mortality after CABG is higher in people with diabetes than in
those without diabetes. Nevertheless, among people with diabetes, survival after indicated CABG surgery
is superior to survival after medical therapy or PCI.[337] [347]
The pivotal trials are summarized as follows:
• In patients with diabetes with left main coronary disease and/or 3-vessel CAD, the SYNTAX
trial found that PCI resulted in higher rates of repeat revascularization and major adverse CV or
cerebrovascular events compared with patients who underwent CABG.[348] [349] However, there
was no difference in rates of all-cause death, stroke, or MI. A long-term follow-up study of the
SYNTAX cohort found the risk of mortality to be greater with PCI than with CABG at 5 years (19.6%
vs. 13.3%), with the opposite observed between 5 and 10 years (20.8% vs. 24.4%).[345]
• The FREEDOM trial evaluated patients with diabetes with multivessel coronary disease (defined as
stenosis of >70% in at least two epicardial vessels without left main disease) and found that CABG
was superior to PCI in terms of reducing death and MI, but CABG patients had an increased rate
of stroke.[350] In an extended follow-up study, the all-cause mortality rate was lower in the CABG
group (18.7%) compared with the PCI group (23.7%).[344]
• In the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) trial, when comparing CABG
versus balloon-only PCI (percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty, PTCA) for
3-vessel disease, 7-year survival was 76.4% for patients with diabetes treated with CABG
compared with 55.7% for those treated with PCI.[351] At 10 years, patients with diabetes who were
assigned to the CABG group had higher survival than the PTCA-assigned group (PTCA 45.5% vs.
CABG 57.8%).[352] This trial was performed prior to stents, aggressive statin therapy, and dual
antiplatelet therapy.
• Subgroup analyses of the Emory Angioplasty versus Surgery Trial (EAST) and the Coronary
Angioplasty versus Bypass Revascularization (CABRI) trials showed that CABG tended to be
associated with better long-term survival over balloon-only PCI for 3-vessel disease.[353]
• The Arterial Revascularization Trial (ART) compared CABG with PCI with bare metal stents in
patients with multivessel disease.[354] Subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes showed 1-
year event-free survival of 84.4% for CABG and 63.4% for PCI.[354] Multiple studies comparing
CABG versus PCI with drug-eluting stents have shown that diabetes is an independent predictor of
target lesion restenosis.[353] [355] Drug-eluting stents appear to be superior to bare-metal stents

MANAGEMENT
in people with diabetes, with regard to major adverse cardiac events such as death, MI, or need for
repeat revascularization.[356] [357] [358] [359] [360]
• The International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive
Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trials investigated the effects of an invasive approach (medical therapy
plus revascularization) versus a conservative approach (medical therapy alone) in patients with
chronic coronary disease.[361] Overall, no benefit was observed for invasive versus conservative
management in patients with diabetes (43% of total cohort).[361]
Medical management with or without revascularization for single-
vessel disease
In stable patients with single-vessel disease and no recent ACS or left ventricular dysfunction, the initial
treatment is conservative and involves guideline-directed medical therapy for CAD. This may include
antihypertensive agents, lipid-lowering agents, and antiplatelet therapy.[362] When optimized, medical
therapy has demonstrated similar outcomes to revascularization.[363] [364] This approach needs patient-
physician discussion to tailor therapy based on symptoms, response to therapy, available expertise, and
patient’s preferences.
The usefulness of coronary revascularization in improving survival is uncertain in patients with single-
vessel disease involving the proximal left anterior descending artery with normal left ventricular
function.[337] Revascularization may be considered after patient-physician discussion as well as
heart team discussion in regards to utility and timing.[337] Coronary revascularization also has an
important role in patients who are symptomatic with angina refractory to maximal medical therapy. If
revascularization is indicated, and the anatomy is amenable to PCI, PCI is preferred over CABG for
single-vessel CAD.[337] [343]
Considerations for patients with specific comorbidities
Heart failure (HF)
• HF is common in patients with diabetes, and in many patients, HF can be the initial presentation of
CVD.[6] [140]
• Patients with diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) should receive HF therapy as per current HF guidelines.[29]
[161] [260]
• Presence of HF in patients with type 2 diabetes influences choice of antihyperglycemic agent.
SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in all patients with HF and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as they
reduce risk of HF-related hospitalization and mortality. Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone) and
saxagliptin (a DPP-4 inhibitor) have been associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations
and are not recommended in patients with or at risk of HF. Metformin, insulin, and sitagliptin and
linagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitors) are considered neutral in terms of their effect on HF outcomes.[6]
In patients with obesity and HFpEF, semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) has been shown
to reduce HF-related symptoms, improve exercise function, and result in greater weight
loss compared with placebo.[365] A GLP-1 receptor agonist may be preferred over other
antihyperglycemic agents in those with HFpEF and obesity.
• Screening for HF in patients with diabetes is important for starting therapy early and optimizing
prognosis. The ADA recommends annual screening of asymptomatic adults with diabetes for
HF.[29]
• See Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  and Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction .

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
CKD
• CKD is a risk factor for CVD and worsening kidney function (lower glomerular filtration rate [GFR],
increased albuminuria) is associated with progressively increased risk of coronary disease.[80]
CVD (in addition to diabetes) is a risk factor for CKD progression and subsequent kidney failure
with replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplant).[366] Patients with diabetes should be
screened for CKD at least annually.[6] [29]
• Reducing the risk of both CV and kidney adverse events is key in these patients. Standard lifestyle
and risk factor modifications (e.g., BP control, lipid control, glycemic control, weight control) are
important. Additionally, specific pharmacologic interventions are recommended:[6] [29]
• SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to reducing hyperglycemia, have renal benefits through
independent effects on renal tubular glucose reabsorption, weight, BP, intraglomerular
pressures, albuminuria, and slowed GFR loss, and are recommended in patients with type
2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic CVD, and CKD to reduce the risk of both CV and
kidney adverse events.
• An ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist is recommended in patients with type
2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic CVD, and CKD, even if they are normotensive, to
reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.[6] [29] [320]
• Finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has been shown in
randomized trials to lower risks of CV events and CKD progression in patients with type
2 diabetes, CKD, and albuminuria.[367] [368] For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD
with albuminuria treated with maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-
II receptor antagonists, who are at an increased risk of cardiovascular events or CKD
progression, the ADA and ESC recommend addition of finerenone.[6] [29]
• If additional glycemic control is needed, a GLP-1 receptor agonist is recommended, as they
improve renal outcomes independent of glucose lowering effect, and have benefits in CV risk
reduction and weight control.
• Low-dose aspirin is recommended in patients with diabetes, CKD, and atherosclerotic CVD.
• In patients with diabetes, CKD, and stable moderate or severe CAD, either an intensive
medical strategy or an initial invasive strategy may be considered.[6]
• Referral to a specialist should be considered.

» Uncontrolled blood glucose levels in the
perioperative or periprocedural period are
associated with adverse outcomes for patients
with diabetes. Benefits of good control include
reductions in length of hospital stay and
likelihood of readmission, as well as improved
postoperative survival rates.[29] However, trials
of tight glycemic control in critically ill patients
have yielded mixed results.[369] [370] In one
study of acute coronary syndrome patients who
presented with hyperglycemia, intensive glucose
control was associated with harm and did not
reduce infarct size.[306] One large randomized
controlled trial raised questions about intensive
blood glucose targets for inpatient glycemic
control and found a lower mortality for intensive
care unit (ICU) patients with a blood glucose
target of 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) than for those
with a blood glucose target of 81 to 108 mg/
dL (4.5 to 6.0 mmol/L).[307] A concern has
been whether there is any additional benefit to
lowering blood glucose levels below about 140
to 180 mg/dL (7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L) in the ICU
setting.[308] One randomized controlled trial
examining the effects of periprocedural intensive
glycemic control during early PCI on the rate
of restenosis in hyperglycemic (glucose ≥140
mg/dL [≥7.8 mmol/L]) patients with a STEMI
showed that intensive control led to a 50%
reduction in restenosis at 6 months compared
with conventional glycemic control.[341]
» The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
recommends that in critically ill patients,
insulin therapy should be started for persistent
hyperglycemia ≥180 mg/dL (≥10 mmol/L)
(tested on two occasions).[29] Once insulin
therapy is started, a target glucose range
of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L) is
recommended for most critically ill patients.[29]
 More stringent goals, such as 110 to 140 mg/

selected patients (e.g., critically ill postsurgical
patients or patients with cardiac surgery),

» The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
recommends an individualized approach
to blood pressure (BP) management, with
consideration of antihypertensive drug therapy
for all nonpregnant patients with diabetes whose
BP is persistently elevated above ≥130/80
mmHg. Guidelines recommend a target goal
of <130/80 mmHg for nonpregnant people with
diabetes, providing this can be safely attained.[6]
[29][60] [61]
» The ADA recommends starting one
antihypertensive agent for patients with initial BP
≥130/80 and <150/90 mmHg, and starting two
antihypertensive agents for those with initial BP
≥150/90 mmHg.[29]
» Patients with diabetic CVD, even if
normotensive, should be treated with an ACE
inhibitor, or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist
if an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated.[29] [60]
However, additional antihypertensive agents may
be required.
» For those whose BP is ≥150/90 mmHg, a
calcium-channel blocker (e.g., amlodipine,
felodipine, nifedipine) or a thiazide diuretic (e.g.,
hydrochlorothiazide) should be considered in
addition at treatment initiation.[29]
» Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol, bisoprolol,
carvedilol) may be appropriate to improve
outcomes as antihypertensive agents in patients
with prior myocardial infarction (MI), active
angina, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, or heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction.[29] These patients are typically
started on beta-blockers alone, with other
antihypertensive therapies added as needed.
If a beta-blocker is indicated, an agent should
be selected that has concomitant vasodilatory
effects to reduce potential for adverse metabolic
impact.[114] Beta-blockers may mask symptoms
of hypoglycemia and also have the potential to
exacerbate hypoglycemic episodes, particularly
when used concurrently with sulfonylureas.[29]
[318] [319]
» Multiple drug therapy is often required in order
to achieve antihypertensive targets.[29] If BP
remains uncontrolled on monotherapy, add
an agent from a different first-line class.[29] If
BP remains uncontrolled despite combination
therapy with first-line agents (i.e., three classes

as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), evaluate for secondary causes
of hypertension (including obstructive sleep
apnea), and consider the addition of an
aldosterone antagonist (e.g., spironolactone,
eplerenone).[29][114] Referral to a hypertension
specialist may also be necessary.[29][114] The
number of antihypertensive therapies required
will vary between patients and is dependent on
their clinical situation and tolerance.
» People with diabetes and hypertension should
monitor their BP at home in addition to having it
checked regularly in the clinic setting.[29]

» For patients with diabetes and established
CVD, guidelines recommend a low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of <55 mg/
dL (<1.42 mmol/L) and at least a 50% reduction
from baseline.[6] [29] [113]
» Statins are the first-line agent for
pharmacologic treatment of dyslipidemia
and may have additional therapeutic effects
independent of lipid-lowering action.[29]
Moderate-intensity statin therapy lowers LDL-C
level by 30% to 50%, while high-intensity statin
therapy lowers it by ≥50%.[113] Low-dose statin
therapy is generally not recommended in people
with diabetes, but it is sometimes the only dose
of statin that an individual can tolerate.[29]
» Guidelines recommend high-intensity statin
therapy in adults of all ages with diabetes and
atherosclerotic CVD.[29] [113] For people who
do not tolerate the intended statin intensity, the
maximum tolerated statin dose should be used.
» Addition of ezetimibe and/or a proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitor (e.g., evolocumab, alirocumab) is
recommended if the LDL-C reduction goal is
not achieved on maximum tolerated statin
therapy.[29]
» For people intolerant of statin therapy, a
PCSK9 inhibitor, bempedoic acid, or inclisiran
should be considered as alternative cholesterol-
lowering therapies.[29]
» A lipid profile should be checked: at initiation
of statins or other lipid-lowering therapy; 4-12
weeks after initiation or a change in dose; and
annually thereafter.[29]
» Icosapent ethyl can be considered in patients
with CVD who are on a statin and have
controlled LDL-C but elevated triglycerides (135
to 499 mg/dL [1.53 to 5.64 mmol/L).[29] It has
been shown to modestly reduce CV events.[114]
[115]
» If triglyceride levels exceed 500 mg/dL (5.65
mmol/L), fibrate therapy may be beneficial to
reduce the risk of pancreatitis.[114] Fibrates
are most often added to statin therapy,
although the ADA notes that this approach is
generally not recommended due to a lack of
evidence of improvement in CVD outcomes.[29]

» For patients with established atherosclerotic
CVD, significant CVD risk factors, established
heart failure (with either preserved or reduced
ejection fraction), or established CKD, addition
of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor
agonist or a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitor is strongly recommended
to reduce the risk of adverse CV or kidney
events.[29][161] [225]
» The American Diabetes Association and
European Association for the Study of Diabetes
advise that for patients in whom atherosclerotic
CVD predominates (e.g., previous MI, unstable
angina, ischemic stroke, or indicators of high CV
risk present), either a GLP-1 receptor agonist
or an SGLT2 inhibitor can be used.[29] [221]
 While definitions of what constitutes high CV
risk vary, most comprise ≥55 years of age with
two or more additional risk factors such as
obesity, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or
albuminuria.[221] Guidelines published by the
American College of Physicians and American
Heart Association/American Stroke Association
specify that GLP-1 receptor agonists should be
prioritized in patients with an increased risk for
stroke.[118] [222]
» For those patients in whom heart failure or
CKD predominates, SGLT2 inhibitors should be
favored.[29][221] [222]
» If HbA1c remains above target and the patient
is taking either an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1
receptor agonist, then combined therapy with an
SGLT2 inhibitor plus a GLP-1 receptor agonist

additive reduction in the risk of adverse CV and
kidney events.[29]
» Liraglutide, injectable semaglutide, and
dulaglutide are the GLP-1 receptor agonists
with the strongest evidence of CV risk reduction
in patients with diabetes.[221][280] [281]
[282] [283][284] In addition to their beneficial
effects on CAD, GLP-1 receptor agonists
are the only drug class that has been shown
to convincingly reduce nonfatal stroke.[222]
[224] [285][286] [287] [288] Unlike for SGLT2
inhibitors, the evidence for GLP-1 receptor
agonists in reducing heart failure or improving
CV outcomes in patients with heart failure has
been inconsistent across trials.[290] Data from
retrospective studies and meta-analyses have
shown superiority of GLP-1 receptor agonists in
comparison with other antidiabetic medications
such as SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors in
terms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).[292]
 However, data from CV outcome trials regarding
the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on PAD
are scarce and further prospective studies are
needed.
» Semaglutide is the only GLP-1 receptor
agonist that is available in both oral and
injectable formulations. However, conclusive
evidence for the CV benefit of oral semaglutide
has not yet been established in clinical
studies.[281] For more information on oral
semaglutide, see Emerging treatments .
» The most common adverse effects of
GLP-1 receptor agonists are gastrointestinal,
particularly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea;
these are frequent but tend to reduce over
time.[293] Patients should be counseled about
potential for ileus.[29] An association with
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer has been
reported in clinical trials, but causality has not
been established; nonetheless, GLP-1 receptor
agonists should be used with caution in patients
with a history of pancreatitis.[29] [293] After a
review of available data, the FDA and European
Medicines Agency (EMA) agreed that there was
insufficient evidence to confirm an increased
risk of pancreatic cancer with use of GLP-1-
based therapies.[294] GLP-1 receptor agonists
have also been associated with increased risk
of gallbladder and biliary diseases including
cholelithiasis and cholecystitis.[293]

receptor agonists are used with sulfonylureas
and insulin. Treatment deintensification of
these agents or of diuretics, particularly in

older and frail individuals, is recommended to
avoid hypoglycemia and hypovolemia.[293]
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been
reported in patients on a combination of a
GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin, when
concomitant insulin was either rapidly reduced or
discontinued; insulin reductions should therefore
be undertaken in a cautious stepwise manner,
with capillary blood glucose monitoring.[293]
» In rodent studies, GLP-1 receptor agonists
were associated with medullary thyroid cancer,
resulting in a black box warning for these agents
in patients with a personal or family history of
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or medullary
thyroid cancer; however, there is conflicting
evidence as to whether this risk applies in
humans.[293] [295] [296] [297] [298]
» The EMA is reviewing data on the risk of
suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self-harm with
GLP-1 receptor agonists, following reports of
such occurrences in people using liraglutide and
semaglutide.[299]
» There is also some concern that GLP1-
receptor agonists, through their rapid glucose-
lowering effects, may increase the risk of
transient worsening of preexisting diabetic
retinopathy.[300] [301] [302] Further studies are
required to elucidate this relationship.
» Empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin
are the SGLT2 inhibitors with the strongest
evidence of CV risk reduction in patients with
diabetes.[120] [221][247] [248] [249] [250] [251]
[252] [253] Ertugliflozin has shown benefit
in reducing heart failure hospitalization, but
not major adverse cardiac events, in patients
with type 2 diabetes.[257] [258] The European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends
dapagliflozin or empagliflozin for all patients with
type 2 diabetes and CKD to reduce risk of heart
failure hospitalization or CV death, regardless
of whether they have a pre-existing heart failure
diagnosis.[261]
» SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce the risk of
serious hyperkalemia in people with type 2
diabetes at high CV risk without increasing the
risk of hypokalemia, allowing the titration of
guideline-directed medical therapy in patients
with heart failure.[268]
» An initial decline in eGFR is commonly
observed frequent after initiating an SGLT2
inhibitor but this decline is not associated with
subsequent risk of CV or kidney events.[269]

Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors should not be interrupted
or discontinued in response to an initial eGFR
decline.
» SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated;
however, some serious adverse reactions have
been documented. Adverse effects include a
higher rate of diabetic ketoacidosis, acute kidney
injury, fracture, and/or amputation. The EMA
also warns of the potential increased risk of toe
amputation.[270] The FDA states the risk of
amputation, while increased with canagliflozin,
is lower than previously described, particularly
when appropriately monitored.[271] The FDA
and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warn of cases
of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (also
known as Fournier gangrene) observed in post-
marketing surveillance of SGLT2 inhibitors.[272]
[273] Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors should be avoided
in patients with conditions that increase the risk
for limb amputations, and in patients prone to
urinary tract or genital infections.
» Sotagliflozin is the first dual SGLT
inhibitor.[274] It inhibits both renal SGLT2
(promoting significant excretion of glucose in the
urine, in the same way as other already available
SGLT2 selective inhibitors) and intestinal SGLT1
(delaying glucose absorption and therefore
reducing postprandial glucose).[274] It has
been approved in people with heart failure
(both with and without diabetes) and in patients
with type 2 diabetes who have CKD or high
risk of/established CVD, to reduce the risk of
hospitalization for heart failure.[29] It is not
currently approved for glycemic management
of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. One concern
with expanded use of SGLT inhibition is
the infrequent but serious risk of diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA), including the atypical
presentation of euglycemic ketoacidosis.[29]
» Of note, the studies that led to the approved
indication of sotagliflozin for heart failure
excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes or
a history of DKA.[275] [276] In clinical trials
of sotagliflozin in people with type 1 diabetes,
results showed improvements in HbA1c and
body weight; however, its use was associated
with an eightfold increase in DKA compared
with placebo.[29] [277] The risks and benefits of
SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes
continue to be evaluated, with consensus
statements providing guidance on patient
selection and precautions.[29] [278]

» Therapeutic lifestyle interventions such as
medical nutrition therapy and increased physical
activity have been shown in large clinical trials
to improve glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure
control, and to improve insulin sensitivity
and markers of inflammation. They are also
effective in achieving sustained weight loss and
improvements in fitness.[47] [71] [173] [174]
[175][176]
» There is no ideal amount of macronutrients
that people with diabetes should consume, and
studies suggest that such recommendations
should be decided on an individual basis.[173]
[180] The Mediterranean Diet, Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH),
vegetarian, and vegan diets have all been
demonstrated to be effective for people with
diabetes.[173] [181] [182] [183] [184] European
guidelines recommend a Mediterranean or plant-
based diet with high unsaturated fat content for
lowering CV risk in people with diabetes.[6] One
meta-analysis found that red meat consumption
was associated with higher risk of CVD and
diabetes, while another reported moderate
certainty evidence that a shift from animal-based
to plant-based foods is beneficially associated
with cardiometabolic health and all-cause
mortality.[185] [186]
» Reducing overall carbohydrate intake has
demonstrated some evidence for improving
glycemia and one study found that among
people with type 2 diabetes, greater adherence
to low-carbohydrate diet patterns was associated
with significantly lower all-cause mortality.[187]
 However, the optimal degree of carbohydrate
restriction, and long-term effects on CVD, are
still unclear.[29]
» Both World Health Organization (WHO)
and European guidelines emphasize that
carbohydrate quality, rather than quantity, is
key.[132] [188] The concept of carbohydrate
quality refers to the nature and composition
of carbohydrates in a food or in the diet,
including the proportion of sugars, how quickly
polysaccharides are metabolized and release
glucose into the body (i.e., digestibility), and
the amount of dietary fiber. It is recommended

disease and premature mortality. When choosing
high-fiber foods, focus should be on minimally
processed and largely intact whole grains, rather
than products with finely milled whole grains
that may also have added sugars, sodium, and
saturated fats.[132] [188] Fiber-enriched foods
and fiber supplements can be considered when
sufficient intake cannot be obtained from diet
alone.[132]
» There is some evidence to suggest that
reducing intake of high glycemic index foods,
and generally reducing glycemic load, could be
beneficial for preventing CVD; however, WHO
guidelines do not make any recommendations
on this, noting that there was a lack of consistent
benefit from diets with lower glycemic index or
glycemic load in observational studies, and little
to no improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors
in randomized controlled trials associated with
lower glycemic index and glycemic load.[188]
[189]
» Replacing saturated fats and trans-fats with
unsaturated fats and carbohydrates from foods
containing naturally occurring dietary fiber (such
as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and pulses)
reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
and also benefits CVD risk.[173] [190] [191]
 Saturated fat should comprise <10% of total
energy intake and trans-fats <1%.[132] [191]
 Dietary fats should mainly come from plant-
based foods high in mono- and poly-unsaturated
fats, such as nuts, seeds, and nonhydrogenated
nontropical vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil,
rapeseed/canola oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil,
linseed oil).[132]
» People with diabetes who have overweight
or obesity should be supported with evidence-
based nutritional support to achieve and
maintain weight loss.[132] European guidelines
recommend that a variety of weight-loss diets
can be used equally effectively for weight
management with type 2 diabetes, provided they
can be followed and meet recommendations
for protein, fat, micronutrient, and fiber intake.
Neither extreme high-carbohydrate, nor very-low
carbohydrate ketogenic diets are recommended,
however.[132] One systematic umbrella review of
published meta-analyses of studies comparing
hypoenergetic diets for weight management
in people with type 2 diabetes did not find
evidence for any particular weight-loss diet over
others (e.g., low-carbohydrate, high-protein,
low-glycemic index, Mediterranean, high-

» Intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating as
strategies for weight and glucose management
have gained popularity.[193] They have been
shown to result in mild to moderate weight
loss (3% to 8% loss from baseline) with no
significant difference in weight loss when
compared with continuous calorie restriction.[29]
The ADA advises that due to its simplicity,
intermittent fasting may lend itself as a useful
strategy for people with diabetes who are looking
for practical eating management tools.[29]
 People with diabetes who are on insulin and/or
secretagogues should be medically monitored
during the fasting period.[29]
» Evidence indicates that low- and very-low-
energy diets (<3500 kJ/day [<840 kcal/day]),
using total diet replacement formula diet
products (replacing all meals) or partial liquid
meal replacement products (replacing 1-2 meals
per day) for the weight-loss phase, are most
effective for weight loss and reduction of other
cardiometabolic risk factors when compared
with the results from self-administered food-
based weight-loss diets.[132] [194] Low-energy
nutritionally complete formula diets with a total
diet replacement induction phase also appear
to be the most effective dietary approach for
achieving type 2 diabetes remission.[132]
 One population-based cohort study found
that those who achieved remission from
diabetes, even for a short time, had a much
lower risk of CVD events, including MI and
stroke, as well macrovascular and microvascular
complications.[195]
» Physical activity: at least 150 minutes
divided over ≥3 days per week of moderate-
to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity
with no more than 2 consecutive days without
exercise.[6] [29] Younger and more physically
fit individuals should aim for ≥75 minutes per
week of vigorous-intensity exercise or interval
training.[29] In the absence of contraindications,
resistance training 2-3 times per week on
nonconsecutive days is also recommended.[6]
[29] The ADA recommends interrupting
sedentary activity every 30 minutes with short
bouts of physical activity.[29] Older adults may
benefit from flexibility and balance exercise 2-3
times per week.[29]

does not support e-cigarettes as an alternative
to smoking or to facilitate smoking cessation.[29]
Patients who quit smoking are prone to weight
gain; therefore, it is important to have weight
management strategies in place to maximize the
CV benefits of smoking cessation.[47]
adjunct weight management
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Obesity pharmacotherapy should be
considered as an adjunct to lifestyle
interventions and behavioral counseling to
improve cardiovascular (CV) risk factors
in people with type 2 diabetes who have
overweight or obesity.[6] [29] [178] For those
with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥27 kg/m² (≥25
kg/m² for Asian-Americans) who are motivated to
lose weight, an initial 3-month trial of medication
should be undertaken. When weight loss is <5%
after 3 months of use, the benefits of ongoing
treatment need to be balanced in the context of
the glycemic response, the availability of other
potential treatment options, treatment tolerance,
and overall treatment burden.[29]
» The American Diabetes Association (ADA)
advises that agents with both glucose-lowering
and weight loss effects should be used first-line;
this includes glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide)
and tirzepatide (a dual glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] and GLP-1
receptor agonist). Two phase 3 trials have
demonstrated the potential for use of tirzepatide
for obesity, with adverse effects similar to
those seen with GLP-1 receptor agonists.[200]
[201] If these medications are not tolerated
or contraindicated, other obesity treatment
options should be considered. Alternative
pharmacologic options include phentermine,
orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, or naltrexone/
bupropion.[29]
» The European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
recommends GLP-1 receptor agonists or
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors as the glucose-lowering agents of
choice for weight loss in type 2 diabetes, in view
of their proven CV benefits for these patients.[6]

» For those not reaching goals, the ADA
recommends evaluating weight management
therapies and intensifying treatment with
additional approaches (e.g., metabolic surgery,
additional pharmacologic agents, and structured
lifestyle management programs).[29]
» As well as considering specific medications
to treat obesity, healthcare professionals
should carefully review the individual’s
concomitant medications and, whenever
possible, minimize or provide alternatives
for medications that promote weight gain.
Examples of medications associated with
weight gain include antipsychotics (e.g.,
clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone), some
antidepressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants,
some selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors), glucocorticoids,
injectable progestins, some anticonvulsants
(e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), beta-blockers,
and possibly sedating antihistamines and
anticholinergics.[29]
» A large number of studies have demonstrated
that metabolic surgery achieves superior
glycemic management and reduction of CV
risk in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity
compared with nonsurgical intervention.[9] [204]
 It has also been shown to reduce microvascular
complications, cancer risk, and all-cause
mortality in people with obesity and type 2
diabetes.[29][205] [206] [207] Of note, one
meta-analysis reported a 50% reduction in
macrovascular complications following bariatric
surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes and
extreme obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m²).[205] Another
meta-analysis found that metabolic surgery
reduced the risk of any CV event by 44% and
yielded a risk reduction of over 55% in overall
mortality and 69% in CV mortality in patients
with type 2 diabetes.[208]
» Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux-
en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most
commonly performed procedures. Both result
in an anatomically smaller stomach pouch; in
VSG, approximately 80% of the stomach is
removed, leaving behind a long, thin sleeve-
shaped pouch, whereas RYGB creates a much
smaller stomach pouch (roughly the size of a
walnut), which is then attached to the distal small
intestine, thereby bypassing the duodenum and
jejunum.[29]

(a direct oral anticoagulant) for secondary
prevention.[29][334] Rivaroxaban has similar
antiplatelet effects to aspirin, and may also
improve endothelial function.[335]
» Following acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
dual antiplatelet therapy with a combination
of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel,
ticagrelor, or prasugrel) is indicated.[336]
 Evidence supports use of either ticagrelor
or clopidogrel if no PCI was performed and
clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel if PCI was
performed.[29] [337] Generally, prasugrel and
ticagrelor have better efficacy in patients with
diabetes and are preferred to clopidogrel for
patients who undergo PCI.[334] [337]
» Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy is also
recommended after high-risk transient ischemic
attack (TIA) and minor stroke.[338]
» Dual antiplatelet therapy may have benefit
beyond 1 year in reducing long-term risk of
recurrent atherosclerotic events.[334] However,
recommendations regarding length of treatment
are rapidly evolving and should be determined
by an interprofessional team approach that
includes a cardiologist following ACS or a
neurologist following TIA/stroke.[29] The benefits
versus risk of bleeding and thrombosis should
be evaluated based on the coronary anatomy
and extent of CAD, PCI complexity, bleeding risk,
age, and patient’s medical comorbidities such as
anemia or renal failure.[339]
» To reduce risk of gastrointestinal bleeding,
proton-pump inhibitors are recommended for
all patients on a combination of antiplatelet or
anticoagulant therapy, and should be considered
for those on a single agent depending on their
individual bleeding risk, according to the ESC.[6]

reduce risk of HF-related hospitalization and
mortality. Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone)
and saxagliptin (a dipeptidyl peptidase-4
[DPP-4] inhibitor) have been associated with an
increased risk of HF hospitalizations and are not
recommended in patients with or at risk of HF.
Metformin, insulin, and sitagliptin and linagliptin
(DPP-4 inhibitors) are considered neutral in
terms of their effect on HF outcomes.[6] In
patients with obesity and HFpEF, semaglutide
(a GLP-1 receptor agonist) has been shown
to reduce HF-related symptoms, improve
exercise function, and result in greater weight
loss compared with placebo.[365] A GLP-1
receptor agonist may be preferred over other
antihyperglycemic agents in those with HFpEF
and obesity.
» Screening for HF in patients with diabetes
is important for starting therapy early and
optimizing prognosis. The ADA recommends
annual screening of asymptomatic adults with
diabetes for HF.[29]

» Reducing the risk of both cardiovascular
(CV) and kidney adverse events is key in these
patients. Standard lifestyle and risk factor
modifications (e.g., BP control, lipid control,

Additionally, specific pharmacologic interventions
are recommended.

inhibitors, in addition to reducing hyperglycemia,
have renal benefits through independent effects
on renal tubular glucose reabsorption, weight,
BP, intraglomerular pressures, albuminuria, and
slowed glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss,
and are recommended in patients with type 2
diabetes, established atherosclerotic CVD, and
chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce the risk
of both CV and kidney adverse events.[6] [29]
» An ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor

Emerging
Efpeglenatide
Efpeglenatide is an investigational exendin-based GLP-1 receptor agonist in phase 3 clinical trials for type
2 diabetes.[371] It is administered as a subcutaneous injection. Results from the AMPLITUDE-O study
showed that efpeglenatide reduced the risk of CV events versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and
either a history of CV disease or current kidney disease plus ≥1 other CV risk factor.[372] Data suggest that
this benefit may be dose-dependent.[373] The most common adverse events with efpeglenatide treatment
were gastrointestinal.[372] An exploratory analysis of AMPLITUDE-O found that the beneficial effect of
efpeglenatide on CV outcomes was independent of baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use.[374] Moreover, a post-hoc
analysis of earlier phase 2 data showed that efpeglenatide may be able to prevent patients with prediabetes
from developing type 2 diabetes.[375] Efpeglenatide has yet to be submitted for regulatory approval.
Oral semaglutide
Both the oral and subcutaneous formulations of the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide are approved for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. While the CV benefit of subcutaneous semaglutide has been well established in
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), oral semaglutide failed to significantly improve major adverse CV events
compared with placebo, and therefore only demonstrated noninferiority.[281] Further evidence is required
to recommend the oral formulation of semaglutide for CV risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes at
high risk for or with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). A long-term CV outcomes
trial comparing oral semaglutide to placebo in people with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease is
ongoing (SOUL; NCT03914326).
Retatrutide
Retatrutide is an investigational novel single peptide with agonist activity at the glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), GLP-1, and glucagon (GCGR) receptors. It is administered as a
subcutaneous injection. Retatrutide demonstrated clinically meaningful glucose- and weight-lowering efficacy
in people with type 2 diabetes in a 12-week phase 1 study.[376] One phase 2 RCT aimed to assess the
safety and efficacy of retatrutide versus dulaglutide and placebo in individuals with type 2 diabetes.[377]
The primary outcome of this study was mean change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 24 weeks, while a key
secondary outcome included mean change in body weight at 36 weeks. Retatrutide resulted in significant
reductions in glycemic control and body weight compared to dulaglutide and placebo. Furthermore, there
were improvements in lipid profile and blood pressure. The majority of adverse effects were gastrointestinal
and mild-to-moderate in nature with no reported deaths.[377] A phase 3 study is currently underway.[378]
Orforglipron
Orforglipron is an investigational oral nonpeptide GLP-1 receptor agonist that is in development for type 2
diabetes and obesity. One phase 2 study evaluated orforglipron at varying doses for the treatment of type 2
diabetes compared to placebo and dulaglutide.[379] Orforglipron achieved meaningful reductions in HbA1c
and body weight at 26 weeks with an adverse events profile consistent with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
Mean reduction in HbA1c (from a mean baseline of 8.1%) with orforglipron at 26 weeks was up to 2.1%,
compared to 0.4% with placebo and 1.1% with dulaglutide. Orforglipron also demonstrated weight reductions
up to 10.1 kg in adults with type 2 diabetes (from a mean baseline of 100.3 kg) compared to 2.2 kg with
placebo and 3.9 kg for dulaglutide. With orforglipron, 65% to 96% of participants achieved an HbA1c of less
than 7.0% at 26 weeks versus 64% in the dulaglutide group and 24% in the placebo group. Similar to other
GLP-1 receptor agonists, orforglipron produced improvements in the blood pressure and levels of circulating
lipids.[379] Phase 3 trials are in progress.[380] [381] [382] [383] [384]
Cagrilintide/semaglutide
A subcutaneous combination drug formulation containing semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) and

with type 2 diabetes (mean loss 14.03 kg).[385] The efficacy and safety of cagrilintide/semaglutide was
assessed in a 32-week, multicenter, double-blind, phase 2 trial.[386] Adults with type 2 diabetes and a body
mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m² on metformin, with or without an SGLT2 inhibitor, were randomly assigned to
cagrilintide/semaglutide , semaglutide alone, or cagrilintide alone. The primary endpoint was change from
baseline in HbA1c; secondary endpoints were bodyweight, fasting plasma glucose, continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) parameters, and safety. Treatment with cagrilintide/semaglutide resulted in clinically
relevant improvements in glycemic control (including CGM parameters). The mean change in HbA1c with
cagrilintide/semaglutide was greater versus cagrilintide alone, but not versus semaglutide alone. Treatment
with cagrilintide/semaglutide resulted in significantly greater weight loss versus semaglutide alone and
cagrilintide alone and was well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 68% of participants in the
cagrilintide/semaglutide group, 71% in the semaglutide alone group, and 80% in the cagrilintide alone
group. Mild or moderate gastrointestinal adverse events were most common; no fatal adverse events were
reported.[386] Longer and larger phase 3 studies are needed.
Colchicine
Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that has been in use for many decades for indications such as
gout. More recently, it has been approved for risk reduction in atherosclerotic CVD. In one randomized,
double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and recent MI (COLCOT;
Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial), colchicine led to a large reduction in CV events compared with
placebo.[387] The COLCOT-T2D study is currently recruiting 10,000 patients in Canada with type 2 diabetes
and no history of CVD; it will evaluate whether low-dose colchicine in addition to standard treatment is
effective in reducing the risk of CV events in this population, with the aim of establishing whether colchicine
could have a role in primary prevention of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes.[388]
Mazdutide
An investigational synthetic peptide analog of mammalian oxyntomodulin which acts as a dual GLP-1 and
glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonist. It is administered as a subcutaneous injection. Mazdutide has shown
promise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity in phase 1 trials.[389] [390] In a phase 2 trial in
Chinese patients with diabetes, treatment with mazdutide for 20 weeks showed significant improvement in
glycemic control and weight loss compared with placebo. The drug appears to be safe with a similar adverse
effect profile to GLP-1 receptor agonists (with gastrointestinal adverse effects most frequently reported).[391]
Phase 3 trials are in progress.
Bexagliflozin
Bexagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, is approved in the US as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve
glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It is not available in Europe. Phase 3 clinical trials have
studied bexagliflozin as monotherapy and in combination with metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes; it
has also been studied in phase 3 trials in adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment, and
in adults with type 2 diabetes and established or increased risk of CVD.[392] [393] [394] [395] [396] [397]
[398] [399] Treatment with bexagliflozin reduced HbA1c compared to placebo and efficacy was noninferior
to glimepiride and sitagliptin, with reduction in HbA1c being shown across subgroups of age, sex, race, and
geographic region. It also showed clinically meaningful improvement in weight, eGFR, and systolic blood
pressure. A head-to-head double-blind RCT demonstrated that bexagliflozin was noninferior to dapagliflozin
as an adjunct to metformin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, where the primary endpoint was
reduction in HbA1c.[400] Secondary efficacy endpoint analyses showed results in both groups consistent
with previous clinical trials, including a reduction in body weight and systolic blood pressure.

or noninitiation; and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile and
reduce the risk of developing CVD in people with diabetes.[29]
• Evidence suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes who achieve remission of their diabetes at any
point in time have a substantially lower incidence of CVD compared with those who do not achieve
remission. The greater the duration of remission, the greater the reduction in CVD risk.[107]
• Alcohol consumption should be limited, with one study suggesting that alcohol abstinence may prevent
new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with type 2 diabetes.[47] [108]
Aspirin
• The routine use of aspirin for primary prevention of diabetic CVD is not generally recommended.
However, in patients with diabetes ages ≥50 years who have at least one additional risk factor (e.g.,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of premature coronary artery disease, current or past
smoker, or chronic kidney disease [CKD]/albuminuria) with no indicators of high bleeding risk (e.g.,
older age, anemia, renal disease, or prior significant bleeding episodes), the American Diabetes
Association (ADA) advises that aspirin therapy may be considered as a primary prevention strategy
following discussion of the benefits versus increased risk of bleeding.[29]
• Coronary calcium score can be used to assess CVD risk and therefore help determine an indication for
aspirin therapy.[29] [76] [109]
• For patients ages >70 years the risk of bleeding increases, and ADA guidelines state that aspirin is
generally not recommended for primary prevention in this population.[29] [110]
• The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against the use of aspirin for the primary
prevention of CVD in adults ages 60 years or older.[111]
Blood pressure (BP) control
• It is well accepted that BP control reduces cardiovascular (CV) risk. There is a lack of high-quality
evidence regarding optimal treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes.[60] However, guidelines
recommend a BP treatment goal of <130/80 mmHg for all patients with diabetes, providing this can be
safely attained.[29] [60] [61]
• For more information on BP control, see Management approach .
Lipid management
• Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the most extensively studied modifiable risk factor
associated with atherosclerotic CVD. There is strong evidence that LDL-C is a causal factor in the
pathophysiology of CVD, and CVD risk reduction is proportional to the absolute and relative LDL-C
reduction achieved.[112]
• Statins are the first-line medication for LDL-C lowering and cardioprotection.[29] Moderate-intensity
statin therapy is defined as therapy that generally lowers LDL-C level by 30% to 50%, while high-
intensity statin therapy lowers it by ≥50%.[113] Low-dose statin therapy is generally not recommended
in people with diabetes, but it is sometimes the only dose of statin that an individual can tolerate; for
individuals who do not tolerate the intended intensity of statin, the maximum tolerated statin dose
should be used.[29]
• A lipid profile should be checked: at time of diagnosis of diabetes; at initiation of statins or other lipid-
lowering therapy; 4-12 weeks after initiation or a change in dose; and annually thereafter.[29]
• For certain patients at intermediate or borderline risk, coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement
may be useful to support shared decision-making for statin therapy.[76] A CAC score ≥100 Agatston
units or in the ≥75th age/sex/race percentile can reclassify CV as being increased.[76]
• For primary prevention of CVD in adults with diabetes without established CVD, ADA guidelines
recommend:[29]
• Consideration of statin therapy in patients ages 20 to 39 years with additional atherosclerotic
CVD risk factors (being mindful that statins are contraindicated in pregnancy).
• Moderate-intensity statin therapy in people ages 40 to 75 years.

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
• High-intensity statin therapy in people ages 40 to 75 years at higher CV risk, including those
with one or more CVD risk factors, to reduce LDL-C by ≥50% of baseline and to target an LDL-C
goal of <70 mg/dL (<1.81 mmol/L).
• Consider addition of ezetimibe or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy in people ages 40 to 75 years at higher CV risk,
especially those with multiple CVD risk factors and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.81 mmol/L).  [PCSK9
inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events] (https://www.bmj.com/
content/377/bmj-2021-069066/infographic)
• For adults ages >75 years already established on statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue
statin treatment. It may be reasonable to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy in this age
group following discussion of the potential benefits and risks.
• In people intolerant of statin therapy, treatment with bempedoic acid is recommended as an
alternative cholesterol-lowering therapy.
• European guidelines recommended a more aggressive target for LDL-C of <55 mg/dL (<1.42 mmol/
L) in very high-risk patients (again, aiming for at least a 50% reduction in LDL-C).[6] This includes
patients with diabetes with severe target end-organ damage or a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or more
using the SCORE2-Diabetes risk calculator.[6]
• Role of other lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies
• Icosapent ethyl can be considered in patients with additional CV risk factors who are on a statin
and have controlled LDL-C but elevated triglycerides (135 to 499 mg/dL [1.53 to 5.64 mmol/
L]).[29] It has been shown to modestly reduce CV events.[114] [115]
• Fibrates are effective for lowering very high triglyceride levels (i.e., >500 mg/dL [>5.65 mmol/
L]) to reduce the risk of pancreatitis.[114] They are most often added to statin therapy, although
the ADA notes that this approach is generally not recommended due to a lack of evidence of
improvement in atherosclerotic CVD outcomes.[29] Furthermore, caution is recommended as
combination statin and fibrate therapy can increase the risk of myositis and rhabdomyolysis. To
lower the risk, fenofibrate is recommended over gemfibrozil.[47]
• Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids has not been found to reduce the rate of CV events in
patients with diabetes at high risk for these events.[116]
• For more information about these lipid-lowering treatments, see Management approach .
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists
• Beyond their role in the treatment of established CVD, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists
may also have a role in primary prevention.
• One retrospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes and no existing CVD found treatment with
these agents to be beneficial in preventing major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and
heart failure.[117]
• Based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the American Heart Association and
American Stroke Association advise that for patients with diabetes who have high CV risk and HbA1c
≥7% (53 mmol/mol), treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist is effective for reducing the risk of
stroke.[118] They note that RCT evidence to support a similar role for SGLT2 inhibitors in primary
prevention is lacking, however.[118]
• Canagliflozin was shown to reduce a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or
nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated CV risk; however, it did not reduce overall
mortality, and led to an increase in lower extremity amputation in certain patient subgroups.[119]
• Dapagliflozin has failed to show reduction in CV outcomes in patients with diabetes without overt
CVD.[120] [121]
• One meta-analysis found that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced atherosclerotic major adverse
cardiac events in patients with type 2 diabetes and coexisting CKD without established CVD; however,
this benefit was not observed in patients without CKD.[122]
• Further large-scale randomized clinical trials investigating SGLT2 inhibitors for the primary prevention
of diabetic CVD are warranted.[117]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
MANAGEMENT
• People with prediabetes are at increased risk of major adverse CV events, and often have other
CV risk factors, including hypertension and dyslipidemia; it is therefore important to screen for and
address CV risk factors in this population as well as in those with established type 2 diabetes.[29]
[123]
• Of note, statin therapy may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in those already at high
risk.[124] For these patients, the ADA recommends regular monitoring of glucose status alongside the
reinforcement of diabetes prevention approaches.[29]
• In people with a history of stroke, and insulin resistance and prediabetes, the ADA recommends that
clinicians consider offering pioglitazone (a thiazolidinedione medication) to lower the risk of future
stroke and myocardial infarction, noting that the benefit of lower CV risk with pioglitazone must be
balanced against the associated increased risks of weight gain, edema, and fracture.[29] Pioglitazone
has also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer, although this association is controversial,
with studies yielding conflicting results; nonetheless, it should be avoided in patients with active
bladder cancer and used with caution in those with a history of the disease.[125] [126] [127] [128]
[129]
Primary prevention of type 2 diabetes
Primordial prevention
• Prevention of cardiometabolic disease begins at the primordial stage and involves targeting potential
behaviors that put the population, especially youth, at risk for insulin resistance and adiposity. Such
population-level interventions include community-based education around healthy eating patterns,
improving nutrition during pregnancy to optimize fetal development, and regulating the marketing and
taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages.[130] [131]
Lifestyle changes
• Progression from prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes can itself be prevented with lifestyle changes,
including increased physical activity, healthy diet, and weight loss/prevention of weight gain. People
with overweight or obesity are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and should aim for at least 5%
weight loss by adopting an intensive lifestyle intervention involving an energy-restricted diet and
increased physical activity.[132]
• Other dietary patterns and food-based approaches that do not primarily target weight loss have
also been associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk. These include Mediterranean, Nordic, and
vegetarian dietary patterns, or diets high in vegetables, fruit, wholegrains and fiber, or low in glycemic
index and load.[132]
• Diets rich in magnesium (e.g., wholegrains, nuts, and green leafy vegetables) have also been shown
to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes and stroke in a dose-dependent manner.[133] One large US cohort
study found that total ultra-processed food consumption was associated with higher risk of developing
type 2 diabetes.[134]
Pharmacologic preventive treatment
• People at high risk of type 2 diabetes may also benefit from pharmacotherapeutic preventive
treatment. However, no pharmacologic agent has been approved for prevention of type 2 diabetes, and
it is not clear whether prevention of overt diabetes translates into eventual reduced CV risk. The risk
versus benefit of each medication in support of person-centered goals must be weighed, in addition to
cost and burden of administration.[29]
• Metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, thiazolidinediones, and insulin have
been shown to lower the incidence of diabetes in specific populations.[29]
• Dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) reduced the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes in patients
with CKD or heart failure compared with placebo, although no improvement in glycemic control was
observed.[135]
• In people with impaired glucose tolerance and CVD or risk factors, nateglinide (a meglitinide
medication) for 5 years did not reduce the incidence of diabetes or composite CV outcomes.[136]
Treatment of hypertension
• One study investigating the effect of BP lowering on the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes found that
reducing systolic BP by 5 mmHg decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 11%.[137] Antihypertensive
treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor agonists led to more favorable outcomes
than treatment with beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or calcium-channel blockers.[137]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Management
• Another study found that valsartan plus lifestyle modification produced a reduction in the incidence of
diabetes but did not reduce the rate of CV events.[138]
Secondary prevention
Risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be elicited and appropriate treatment
given. See Management approach .
A large international trial showed that 29% of patients studied could attain all 5 common secondary
prevention parameters (smoking cessation, lipid reduction, blood pressure control, aspirin use, and ACE
or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist use) with intensive risk factor modification, while 71% of patients
studied could achieve 4 out of the 5 parameters.[419] However, in a large US cohort study of patients with
diabetes and known CVD, only 6.9% received guideline-recommended medical therapies for cardiovascular
risk (CV) reduction.[172] Although diet and exercise are commonly recommended, one study found no
significant reduction in CV events in patients with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity who underwent
an intensive diet and exercise program when compared with a control group.[420]
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy
can play a significant role in reducing future risk in individuals with established atherosclerotic CVD, heart
failure, or chronic kidney disease, and use of one these agents should be strongly considered, if not
contraindicated, for the secondary prevention of macrovascular complications.[221][421] The American Heart
Association and American Stroke Association advise that in patients with diabetes who have established
CVD and hemoglobin A1c ≥7%, treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist is effective for reducing the
risk of stroke.[118] Despite the overwhelming evidence of CVD benefit from large CV outcome trials, the
number of patients receiving these drugs remains low. Several reasons have been proposed for this: clinical
inertia, a lack of knowledge in healthcare practitioners about the results of CV outcome trials, uncertainty
in prescribing these agents, and concerns about potential side effects.[422] An analysis of patients in the
Swedish National Diabetes Register estimated that giving semaglutide to people with a very high CVD risk
who have already had a CV event may prevent around 803 CV events each year.[423]
Patient discussions
Medical nutrition therapy
• There is no ideal amount of macronutrients that people with diabetes should consume, and studies
suggest that such recommendations should be decided on an individual basis.[173] [180] The
Mediterranean Diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), vegetarian, and vegan
diets have all demonstrated some efficacy in people with diabetes.[173] [181] [182] [183] [184]
Disclosing and communicating CV risk levels to at-risk patients has been shown to increase self-
reported dietary modification.[418]
• Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated evidence for
improving glycemia.[29] However, the optimal degree of carbohydrate restriction, and long-term
effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD), are still unclear.[29] Both World Health Organization
(WHO) and European guidelines emphasize that carbohydrate quality, rather than quantity, is key,
with the primary marker of quality being the amount of dietary fiber consumed.[188]
• Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats and carbohydrates from foods containing naturally
occurring dietary fiber (such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits and pulses) reduces low-density
lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and also benefits CVD risk.[173] [190] [191] Saturated fat should
comprise <10% of total energy intake and trans-fats <1%.[132] [191] Dietary fats should mainly
come from plant-based foods high in mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, such as nuts, seeds, and
nonhydrogenated nontropical vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil, rapeseed/canola oil, soybean oil,
sunflower oil, linseed oil).[132]
• Evidence indicates that low- and very low- (<3500 kJ/day [<840 kcal/day]) energy diets, using total
diet replacement formula diet products (replacing all meals) or partial liquid meal replacement
products (replacing 1 to 2 meals per day) for the weight-loss phase, are most effective for weight
loss and reduction of other cardiometabolic risk factors when compared with the results from self-
administered food-based weight-loss diets.[132] [194] Low-energy nutritionally complete formula
diets with a total diet replacement induction phase also appear to be the most effective dietary

approach for achieving type 2 diabetes remission.[132] One population-based cohort study found
that those who achieved remission from diabetes, even for a short time, had a much lower risk of
CVD events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well macrovascular and microvascular
complications.[195]
Physical activity
• The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends assessment of the following prior to
starting an exercise program; age; physical condition; blood pressure; and presence or absence
of autonomic neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy, balance impairment, history of foot ulcers or
Charcot foot, or untreated proliferative retinopathy.[29]
• Adults with diabetes should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate- to vigorous-
intensity aerobic physical activity.[6] [29] The physical activity should be spread over at least 3 days
per week, with no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise.[29]
• Younger and more physically fit individuals should aim for ≥75 minutes per week of vigorous-
intensity exercise or interval training.[29]
• In the absence of contraindications, 20 minutes of resistance training 2 to 3 times per week on
nonconsecutive days is also recommended.[6] [29]
• Sedentary periods should be interrupted by activity every 30 minutes.[29]
• Older adults may benefit from balance and flexibility training 2 to 3 times per week.[29]
• Regular motivational feedback is important to maintain patient adherence to the exercise
program.[198]
Dyslipidemia
• Lifestyle modification focused on reduced saturated fat intake, weight loss, and increased physical
activity has been shown to improve lipid control in patients with diabetes.[29]
Smoking cessation
• All patients with diabetes should be advised not to smoke or to quit smoking.[29] Smoking
counseling and other forms of smoking cessation therapy should be incorporated into routine
diabetes care.[29] Varenicline combined with nicotine replacement therapy may be more effective
than varenicline alone.[199] The ADA does not support e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking or
to facilitate smoking cessation.[29]
• Patients who quit smoking are often prone to weight gain; it is therefore important to have weight
management strategies in place to maximize the CV benefits of smoking cessation.[47]
Hypertension
• People with diabetes and hypertension should monitor their blood pressure at home in addition
to having it checked regularly in the clinic setting, both to ensure accuracy of readings and to
encourage adherence to treatment regimens.[29]
Heterogeneity between different racial and ethnic groups requires culturally sensitive, peer-led community
and healthcare professional education.[95] Key considerations in providing culturally sensitive care
are the patient’s preferred language and religion, dietary restrictions, sex identity, cultural norms and
practices, health literacy, and cultural differences in communication style.[95]

Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients with diabetes benefit from monitoring at least every 3 months if their diabetes is not well
controlled and every 6 to 12 months otherwise.[29] Blood pressure, weight, and activity level should be
monitored at each visit and healthy lifestyle modifications encouraged.[29]
Joint American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend that all
patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (e.g., calf claudication;
decreased or absent pedal pulses; nonhealing wounds) should have an ankle-brachial index (ABI)
measured, with or without ankle pulse volume recordings and/or Doppler waveforms.[28] Screening
with resting ABI is also considered reasonable in patients with any of the following characteristics:
age ≥65 years or older; age 50-64 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., diabetes, smoking
history, dyslipidemia, hypertension), chronic kidney disease, or family history of PAD; age <50 years with
diabetes and one additional risk factor for atherosclerosis; patients with known atherosclerotic disease in
another vascular bed (e.g., coronary, carotid, subclavian, renal, mesenteric artery stenosis, or abdominal
aortic aneurysm).[28] The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for PAD using ABI
in asymptomatic patients with diabetes who have any of the following characteristics: age ≥50 years;
diabetes with duration ≥10 years; comorbid microvascular disease; clinical evidence of foot complications;
or any end-organ damage from diabetes.[29] See Diabetes-related foot disease .
In patients on lipid-lowering therapy, a lipid profile should be checked: at initiation of statins or other lipid-
lowering therapy, 4-12 weeks after initiation or a change in dose, and annually thereafter.[29]
Serum creatinine/estimated glomerular filtration rate and potassium should be checked within 7-14 days
of initiation of treatment with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, aldosterone antagonist,
or diuretic, as well as following uptitration of dose and then at least annually.[29]
Screening for heart failure in patients with diabetes is important for starting therapy early and optimizing
prognosis. The American Diabetes Association recommends annual screening of asymptomatic adults
with diabetes for heart failure.[29] Opportunistic screening for atrial fibrillation is recommended by the
European Society of Cardiology in all patients with diabetes ages under 65 years; systematic screening
should be considered for those ages 75 years and over or at high stroke risk.[6]

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atrial fibrillation (AF) and other dysrhythmias variable medium
Autonomic dysfunction occurs in 40% to 50% of patients with diabetes.[19] This may result in
sympathovagal imbalance, which lowers the threshold for life-threatening arrhythmias.[19] Patients who
have diabetes and AF have a substantially increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV)
mortality, stroke, kidney disease, and heart failure.[6]
Patients with arrhythmias should be monitored and referred for appropriate treatment. Opportunistic
screening for AF, by pulse taking or ECG, is recommended in European guidelines for all patients with
diabetes ages under 65 years; systematic screening should be considered for those ages 75 years and
over or at high stroke risk.[6]
When indicated by risk stratification (e.g., CHA₂DS₂-VASc score), long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is
used in patients with AF for reduction of ischemic stroke and other ischemic events. A bleeding risk score
should also be used to identify and address potential bleeding risk factors, for example, concomitant use of
antiplatelet agents.[6]
ischemic toe/foot, gangrene, or amputation variable medium
Joint American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend that
all patients with history or physical exam findings suggestive of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
should have a resting ankle-brachial index (ABI), with or without ankle pulse volume recordings and/
or Doppler waveforms.[28] Screening with resting ABI is also considered reasonable in patients
with any of the following characteristics: age ≥65 years or older; age 50 to 64 years with risk factors
for atherosclerosis (e.g., diabetes, smoking history, dyslipidemia, hypertension), chronic kidney
disease (CKD), or family history of PAD; age <50 years with diabetes and one additional risk factor for
atherosclerosis; patients with known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (e.g., coronary,
carotid, subclavian, renal, mesenteric artery stenosis, or abdominal aortic aneurysm).[28] The American
Diabetes Association recommends screening for PAD using ABI in asymptomatic people with any of
the following characteristics: age ≥50 years; diabetes with duration ≥10 years; comorbid microvascular
disease; clinical evidence of foot complications; or any end-organ damage from diabetes.[29] ABI results:
1.0 to 1.4 is normal; 0.91 to 0.99 is borderline; ≤0.9 is abnormal.
vascular dementia variable medium
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of dementia. Etiologic factors include vascular factors
(cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors, atherosclerosis, and peripheral arterial disease)
and nonvascular factors (hyperglycemia leading to excess formation of advanced glycated end-products,
disturbed neuronal signaling leading to cerebral amyloidosis).[415]
depression variable medium
The prevalence of depressive disorders is twice as high in patients with diabetes compared with those
without diabetes. Depression is also common in patients with coronary disease, particularly after acute
infarction. It is associated with worse health behaviors and possibly worse cardiovascular outcomes.[416]
Evidence on the cardiac effects of depression treatment is limited, but it is reasonable to screen patients
and treat as indicated.[320] [321] [417]

Diabetic cardiovascular disease Follow up
Prognosis
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in people with diabetes.[10] People with
diabetes have a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) compared with people without
diabetes. Coronary artery disease in people with diabetes is more severe, starts at an earlier age, and is
more costly. In addition, patients with type 1 diabetes are at higher risk of death after MI than patients without
diabetes.[408] 
Diabetes is an independent predictor of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in people with heart
failure.[409] [410] The relative risk of CV-related death or heart failure-related hospitalization is greater in
people with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic heart failure) than with low ejection fraction. 
Multiple studies comparing coronary artery bypass graft versus percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting
stents have shown that diabetes is an independent predictor of target lesion restenosis.[315] [353] Drug-
eluting stents appear to be superior to bare-metal stents in people with diabetes, with regard to major
adverse cardiac events such as death, MI, or need for repeat revascularization.[356] [357] [358] [359] [360]
While the benefits of optimizing CVD risk factors are clear in patients with diabetes, in practice many
patients are not achieving recommended targets.[411] [412] [413] Data from the US Diabetes Collaborative
Registry of 74,393 adults with diabetes demonstrate a prevalence of 74% with HbA1c <7%, 40% with blood
pressure <130/80 mmHg, and 49% with low density lipoprotein-cholesterol <100 mg/dL (<70 mg/dL if with
atherosclerotic CVD), but only 15% at target for all 3 factors.[414] Newer evidence-based therapies for
diabetes proven to reduce CVD risk, including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like
peptide 1 receptor agonists, remain highly underused.[4]

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
