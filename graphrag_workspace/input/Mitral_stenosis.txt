Mitral stenosis Overview
Summary
Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve orifice. Fusion of the leaflet commissures or encroachment
by annular calcium reduces the orifice area. Usually occurs as a consequence of rheumatic fever in low- and
middle-income countries but is more likely due to mitral annular calcification in high-income countries.
Causes decreased filling of the left ventricle, while simultaneously increasing left atrial pressure, producing
the syndrome of heart failure.
As disease progresses, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure occur.
Mild disease can be treated symptomatically with diuretics. Moderate to severe disease requires mechanical
correction of the valve obstruction by valvotomy, valve repair, or valve replacement.
Definition
Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve orifice, often caused by rheumatic valvulitis producing fusion
of the valve commissures and thickening of the valve leaflets.

Mitral stenosis Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Most cases of mitral stenosis are caused by rheumatic fever. While rheumatic fever is now very rare in
high-income countries, it remains epidemic in much of the world. The greatest burden of acute rheumatic
fever and rheumatic heart disease is in people in low- and middle-income countries and in populations
of indigenous people living in poverty in high-income countries.[1] The highest prevalence and age-
standardized mortality of rheumatic heart disease are in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan
Africa.[2] [3] There is no clear sex predilection for acute rheumatic fever, although rheumatic heart disease
is much more common in females. Acute rheumatic fever is most common in tropical countries with no
seasonal variation. The highest rates of acute rheumatic fever have been documented in Aboriginal
children in the Northern Territory of Australia and Pacific peoples, including those living in the US and New
Zealand.[4] In the US, the annual national incidence of rheumatic fever is unknown, as it is no longer a
nationally notifiable disease.[5]
Etiology
Rheumatic fever leading to rheumatic heart disease is the main cause of mitral stenosis.
Rarer causes of mitral stenosis include congenital deformity of the valve, the carcinoid syndrome, use of
ergot and/or serotonergic drugs such as fenfluramine, SLE, mitral annular calcification (MAC) due to aging,
and amyloidosis.
It is thought that some M antigens are held in common by the heart and some strains of group A
streptococci.[6] [7] Following infection by the organism (usually manifested as pharyngitis), the inflammatory
response against the bacterium leads also to attack of the heart. This concept has, however, been
challenged. There is evidence that, rather than immunological cross-reactivity giving rise to tissue damage,
the streptococcal M protein may bind directly to the valvular collagen, inciting an inflammatory response.[8]
While endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium may all be involved, it is the endocardium containing the
heart valves that receives the most inflammatory damage. During an attack of acute rheumatic fever the
mitral valve becomes thickened and retracted leading to mitral regurgitation. However, years later, fusion
of the mitral leaflet commissures and thickening of the leaflets and subvalvular apparatus cause mitral
stenosis.[9] It is still unclear whether this remote damage stems from hemodynamic stress on a previously
damaged valve or is caused by ongoing inflammation from a smoldering rheumatic process.[10]
As world populations age, MAC, a nonrheumatic build up of calcium in the mitral annulus, is another
important cause of mitral stenosis. Here, the leaflets themselves are usually normal and stenosis is caused
by encroachment of calcium on the mitral orifice.
Pathophysiology
The normal mitral valve has an orifice area of about 4 cm² that permits free flow of blood from the left atrium
into the left ventricle during diastole. As the valve orifice becomes reduced in mitral stenosis, flow between
left atrium and left ventricle is progressively impeded and pressure in the left atrium remains higher than that
of the left ventricle.[9]
By restricting flow, mitral stenosis results in 2 primary pathophysiologic consequences:

Mitral stenosis Theory
• Increased left atrial pressure is referred to the lungs, where it leads to congestion and the symptoms
associated with it
• The restricted orifice limits filling of the left ventricle, thereby limiting cardiac output.
Thus, although left ventricular contractility is usually normal, the pathophysiologic effects of mitral stenosis
produce a syndrome mimicking left heart failure.
As left atrial pressure increases, a pressure overload encumbers the right ventricle, the chamber responsible
for filling the left ventricle. With progression of the disease, pulmonary vasoconstriction adds to right
ventricular pressure overload, and severe pulmonary hypertension may ensue.
Whether left ventricular contractility is affected in mitral stenosis is still in debate.[11] [12] [13] Ejection
performance is reduced in about one third of patients. In most patients this is secondary to increased
afterload induced by reflexive vasoconstriction and is compounded by reduced preload from reduced
left ventricular filling.[14] In such cases the ejection performance returns to normal following relief of the
mitral stenosis.[15] However, in developing countries where the rheumatic process seems very aggressive,
myocardial injury and impaired contractility may be present.[12]
Case history
Case history #1
A 36-year-old prima gravida presents with dyspnea on exertion and two-pillow orthopnea (requiring two
pillows at night to alleviate recumbent dyspnea) during her second trimester. Previous physical exams had
disclosed no cardiac abnormalities. On current physical exam she has a loud first heart sound and a 2/6
diastolic rumbling murmur.
Case history #2
An 83-year-old man presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past year. He is frail and his
activities are limited but he notes difficulty climbing five stairs to access his front door. He complains of
two-pillow orthopnea. On physical exam his neck veins are elevated. No murmur is heard.
Other presentations
May present with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or systemic embolism.

Mitral stenosis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
A history of dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or peripheral edema is suggestive of mitral
stenosis. Occasionally, a documented history of rheumatic fever may prompt the provider to seek a history
probing for the typical symptoms.
Mitral stenosis is usually diagnosed when the characteristic diastolic murmur is heard on physical
examination. This is a low-pitched, rumbling murmur that is best heard at the heart apex with the patient in
the left lateral position. It may be accentuated by having the patient perform handgrip exercises.
Associated signs include an irregular pulse suggestive of atrial fibrillation, rales suggestive of left ventricular
failure, and, in severe cases, signs of pulmonary hypertension (loud P2) and signs of right heart failure
(peripheral edema and ascites).
Investigations
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showing typical valve deformities is the definitive test for diagnosis
of mitral stenosis and should be performed on all patients with a diastolic murmur.[22] [23] [24]

ECG and chest x-ray (CXR) should also be performed. They are nonspecific for mitral stenosis but form
a useful baseline of cardiac rhythm and function. ECG may reveal left atrial enlargement, right ventricular
hypertrophy, and/or atrial fibrillation. CXR may show a double right heart border indicating an enlarged left
atrium, a prominent pulmonary artery, and/or Kerley B lines.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is recommended if the diagnosis is unclear following TTE and
also before anticipated valvotomy to examine for thrombus.[22] [23] Additionally, the echocardiographic
appearance of the valve in mitral annular calcification-related mitral stenosis is quite different from
rheumatic mitral stenosis. The mitral leaflets are usually normal, although in some cases the basal parts
of the leaflets may be calcified. There is dense calcification of the mitral annulus, encompassing part
or all of the annulus. TEE may be especially helpful in assessing the extent and density of the annular
calcification.[24]
Because of its invasive nature, cardiac catheterization should be performed only in patients with
echocardiogram results that are difficult to interpret and when mechanical correction is contemplated.
Measurement of left atrial and left ventricular pressure and cardiac output are entered into the Gorlin
formula used to calculate mitral valve area.[25]

Dynamic exercise testing
For patients who fail to receive adequate relief from diuretics or when exercise-induced symptoms seem
out of proportion to stenosis severity, hemodynamics should be measured at rest and with exercise either
with echocardiography or cardiac catheterization to determine if surgical intervention is required.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
history of rheumatic fever (common)
• While rheumatic fever is the usual cause of mitral stenosis, the history of a previous attack of
rheumatic fever is notoriously unreliable.[26]
• Many patients who claim a rheumatic fever history have no evidence of rheumatic heart disease,
whereas many patients with clear evidence of rheumatic valvulopathy deny ever having had rheumatic
fever.
dyspnea (common)
• As the mitral valve orifice narrows, increased left atrial pressure results in pulmonary congestion.
orthopnea (common)
• As a consequence of increased left atrial pressure.
opening snap on auscultation (common)
• The stiffened valve opens with a snap.
• In mitral annular calcification-related disease, the leaflets move relatively normally and this finding is
absent.

DIAGNOSIS
diastolic murmur (common)
• Flow through the narrowed valve produces a low pitched rumbling murmur.
• Best heard with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and may be accentuated by having the
patient perform handgrip exercise.
• In MAC-related disease the murmur may be absent, perhaps owing to different anatomy from
rheumatic disease.
•
loud P2 (common)
• Sign of pulmonary hypertension and/or right ventricular failure.
neck vein distension (common)
• Sign of pulmonary hypertension and/or right ventricular failure.
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (uncommon)
• As a consequence of increased left atrial pressure.
hemoptysis (uncommon)
• Sudden increases in pulmonary venous pressure, especially during exercise, may rupture bronchiolar
vein anastomoses leading to hemoptysis.
hoarseness (uncommon)
• The enlarged left atrium may encroach upon the left recurrent laryngeal nerve producing vocal cord
paralysis and hoarseness. This is known as Ortner syndrome.
peripheral edema (uncommon)
• As pulmonary hypertension becomes severe, right ventricular failure leads to right atrial hypertension,
volume retention, and edema.
ascites (uncommon)
• Sign of severe pulmonary hypertension leading to right ventricular failure and right atrial hypertension.
Other diagnostic factors
40-50 years old in rheumatic mitral stenosis, 70-90 years old in mitral annular
calcification (MAC)-related disease (common)
• In high-income countries, the first symptoms of mitral stenosis related to rheumatic disease usually
appear in the fourth and fifth decades of life. In low- and middle-income countries, symptoms occur at
a younger age.[27] MAC-related disease is generally seen in older people.
loud first heart sound (S1) (common)
• The pandiastolic transvalvular gradient holds the valve open until the ventricular systole closes it,
producing a loud S1.
irregularly irregular pulse (uncommon)
• Left atrial enlargement and increased age commonly cause atrial fibrillation in patients with mitral
stenosis.

flushed cheeks (uncommon)
• The patient may appear with prominent reddish cheeks, known as mitral facies.
Risk factors
Strong
streptococcal infection
• Untreated streptococcal infection with strains containing an M antigen that is cross-reactive with,
or binds to, the myocardium is the major risk factor for developing rheumatic fever and subsequent
rheumatic heart disease.[8] [16]
• The most common infection is streptococcal pharyngitis. In the US, epidemic streptococcal infection
occurs primarily in crowded situations such as schools, college dormitories, and military barracks.
• Socioeconomic status must in some way influence the risk of contracting rheumatic fever, as there
is a large difference in attack rate between developed and developing nations. How this risk factor
translates to increased attack rates is uncertain.
female sex
• Women are 3 times more likely than men to have mitral stenosis.
Weak
ergot medications
• Chronic ingestion of methysergide or ergotamine may result in endocardial thickening and valve
dysfunction, commonly aortic and mitral stenosis.[17]
serotonergic medications
• Such as fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine. Valvular abnormalities, mostly regurgitant lesions, resulted
in the voluntary withdrawal from market of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine in September 1997.[18]
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
• Mitral stenosis is a rare complication of SLE-related valvular disease.[19]
amyloidosis
• Cardiac amyloidosis can cause valvular thickening.[20]
bronchial carcinoid syndrome
• Carcinoid syndrome typically causes right heart valve disease (tricuspid and pulmonary valve) unless
bronchial carcinoid is present, in which case left heart lesions may occur.[17]
atherosclerotic risk factors
• Mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a process related to atherosclerosis and
shares many of the same risk factors including age, hypertension, and inflammation.[21]

Mitral stenosis Diagnosis
Stages of mitral stenosis (rheumatic disease)
Adapted from Otto CM et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 2021:77:e25-e197
In mitral annular calcification-related disease, the hemodynamic criteria are the same as for rheumatic
disease. However, as most of these patients are older people, both left atrium and left ventricle compliance
are usually reduced, adding another hemodynamic cause for the patient’s symptoms that will not be relieved
even if mitral intervention is successful.[28] Additionally, the echocardiographic appearance of the valve is
quite different from rheumatic mitral stenosis. The mitral leaflets are usually normal although in some cases
they may be calcified. There is dense calcification of the mitral annulus, encompassing part or all of the
annulus. Transesophageal echocardiography may be especially helpful in assessing the extent and density
of the annular calcification.
Echocardiographic variables relating to valvotomy outcome
(rheumatic disease only)[29] [30] [31]
Each of the following are graded on a severity score of 1 to 4:
• Valve mobility
• Calcification
• Leaflet thickening
• Subvalvular apparatus distortion
The maximum pathologic score is 16 and the minimum is 4.
Valve scores of <9 suggest a good outcome with balloon valvotomy.

Mitral stenosis Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Mitral stenosis is a mechanical obstruction to inflow of the left ventricle. As such, definitive therapy for
patients with rheumatic disease requires a mechanical solution by percutaneous balloon valvotomy, surgical
mitral valve repair, or valve replacement. Definitive therapy should be offered to patients with severe
symptomatic disease who are unlikely to benefit from medical therapy alone, and may be considered in
some patients with severe asymptomatic disease.[22] [23] Management of mitral annular calcification (MAC)-
related mitral stenosis is similar to the management of rheumatic disease; however, balloon valvotomy is not
recommended in these patients.
Rheumatic disease: progressive disease (gradient <5 mmHg, valve
area >1.5 cm²)
Patients with less than severe disease do not benefit from mechanical therapy, because it is not likely to
significantly increase an already relatively adequate valve area.
Rheumatic disease: severe asymptomatic disease (gradient >5
mmHg, valve area <1.5 cm²)
Asymptomatic patients with severe disease usually do not require therapy. However, balloon mitral
valvotomy may be considered for patients with very severe disease (valve area <1.0 cm²) when valve
morphology is favorable for that procedure or when atrial fibrillation intervenes. Pulmonary hypertension
may also be considered in the decision to proceed to balloon valvotomy.[22] [23]
Rheumatic disease: severe symptomatic disease (gradient >5
mmHg, valve area <1.5 cm²)
A diuretic may reduce left atrial pressure and relieve mild symptoms. However, patients with severe
disease are unlikely to benefit from medical therapy alone, and mechanical relief from valve obstruction is
often the only effective remedy for symptoms and for pulmonary hypertension.
Percutaneous balloon valvotomy is the treatment of choice when valve anatomy is suitable for this
procedure.[22] [23] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]
Valve mobility, calcification, leaflet thickening, and subvalvular apparatus distortion are graded on
a severity score of 1 to 4.[29] Valves with a score of <9 are usually considered optimal for balloon
valvotomy.
In patients with higher valve scores, surgery to perform open valve repair (commissurotomy) may be
possible. However, mitral valve replacement is more commonly performed.
Patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis are usually relatively young. This complicates the choice of
valve for replacement, as bioprosthetic valves are likely to suffer valve deterioration requiring repeat
replacement within several years. Mechanical valves are durable and will likely last for the lifetime of
the patient, yet are thrombogenic, and patients require anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g.,
warfarin).[22] Bleeding complications from the anticoagulants used to prevent thromboembolism occur
approximately at a rate of 2% per year.[37] In view of the disadvantages of each option, patient preference
has a key role in choosing which type of replacement valve to use.
For patients with multiple comorbid conditions that make open heart surgery high risk, balloon valvotomy
may offer relief in rheumatic disease even when valve anatomy is suboptimal and valve score is high.

Mitral stenosis Management
For patients with mitral stenosis in normal sinus rhythm who experience worsening of symptoms with
exercise, heart rate control with a beta-blocker may be considered.[22] Ivabradine may be an alternative
to beta-blockers for rate control in these patients. Three trials compared beta-blockers and ivabradine
for exercise tolerance in patients with severe mitral stenosis.[38] [39] [40] In all three trials, ivabradine
improved exercise tolerance compared with baseline and in two of the trials, ivabradine was superior to
beta blockade.[38] [39]
MAC-related disease
Medical therapy for MAC-related disease is identical to that of rheumatic disease (see above), with the
exception of the type of anticoagulation used. While no studies exist to compare vitamin K antagonists
to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in MAC-related disease, current guidelines indicate that vitamin K
antagonists are indicated in rheumatic disease because of ongoing inflammation. Thus DOACs may be
suitable for atrial fibrillation in MAC patients.
Balloon valvotomy is not an appropriate treatment option for patients with MAC-related disease. Balloon
valvotomy is ineffective in these patients because the restriction to flow resides not in the valve itself, but
rather, in dense calcification of the annulus which is resistant to dilation. Unfortunately the other major
option, surgical valve replacement, has a poor outcome due to the risk atrioventricular disruption when
the calcium in the annulus is removed to permit placement of a valvular prosthesis.[41] In one study, the
median 30-day surgical mortality was 6.3%, but was as high as 27%.[42] Further, most patients with MAC
are older people and have multiple comorbidities, additionally worsening prognosis. In general, if such
patients are considered for surgery, they should be referred to surgeons with a high volume experience in
treating MAC-related disease.
Pregnancy
Pregnant women with mitral stenosis may develop symptoms in the second trimester, when the demand
for cardiac output increases by around 70%.
A systematic review found a lack of evidence concerning effectiveness of the various treatments for
valvular heart disease in pregnancy.[43] Diuretics are given to control mild symptoms. If symptoms
worsen and heart failure threatens the life of mother and/or fetus, balloon valvotomy can be performed
safely in patients with rheumatic disease.[44] MAC-related disease is extremely rare in pregnancy.

» Balloon valvotomy for patients with rheumatic
disease may be considered for asymptomatic
patients with very severe disease (valve area
<1.0 cm²) when valve morphology is favorable
or when atrial fibrillation intervenes. The
presence of pulmonary hypertension may also
be considered in the decision to proceed to
balloon valvotomy.
» Balloon valvotomy is not an appropriate
treatment option for patients with mitral annular
calcification (MAC)-related disease. In patients
with MAC, balloon valvotomy is ineffective
because the restriction to flow resides not in
the valve itself, but rather, in dense calcification
of the annulus which is resistant to dilation.
Surgical valve replacement has a poor outcome
due to the risk atrioventricular disruption when
the calcium in the annulus is removed to permit
placement of a valvular prosthesis.[41] In one
study, the median 30-day surgical mortality was
6.3%, but was as high as 27%.[42] Further, most
patients with MAC are older people and have
multiple comorbidities, additionally worsening
prognosis. In general, if such patients are
considered for surgery, they should be referred
to surgeons with a high volume experience in
treating MAC-related disease.

Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Mechanical relief from valve obstruction
is often the only effective remedy for severe
symptoms and for pulmonary hypertension in
patients with rheumatic disease. Percutaneous
balloon valvotomy is the treatment of choice
when valve anatomy is suitable for this
procedure. Each of the following is graded
on a severity score of 1 to 4: valve mobility,
calcification, leaflet thickening, and subvalvular
apparatus distortion. Thus a minimum score of 4
and a maximum of 16 are possible. Valves with
a score of less than 9 are usually considered
optimal for balloon valvotomy. In patients with
higher valve scores, surgery to perform open
valve commissurotomy or valve replacement is
undertaken.

adjunct anticoagulation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in

» Patients undergoing valve replacement require
anticoagulation. A vitamin K antagonist (e.g.,
warfarin) is recommended in patients with
rheumatic disease.[22] In patients with mitral
annular calcification (MAC)-related disease,
direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be
suitable for atrial fibrillation in these patients.
However, no studies exist to compare vitamin K
antagonists to DOACs in MAC-related disease.
Consult your local protocols for further guidance
on suitable anticoagulation options and doses.

» For patients with mitral stenosis in normal
sinus rhythm who experience worsening of
symptoms with exercise, heart rate control with a
beta-blocker may be considered.[22]
» Ivabradine may be an alternative to beta-
blockers for rate control in these patients.
Three trials compared beta-blockers and
ivabradine for exercise tolerance in patients with
severe mitral stenosis.[38] [39] [40] In all three
trials, ivabradine improved exercise tolerance
compared with baseline and in two of the trials,
ivabradine was superior to beta blockade.[38]

Mitral stenosis Management
Emerging
Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR)
The difficulties with surgery in patients with mitral annular calcification-related disease have led to an interest
in TMVR. Several devices and techniques are currently under investigation but have not reached use in
standard practice.[41]
Primary prevention
Early antibiotic therapy for streptococcal infection is helpful in preventing rheumatic fever.[16] However, the
incidence of rheumatic fever began to fall before introduction of antibiotics, suggesting that other factors are
involved.
Secondary prevention
Patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve or previous episode of infective endocarditis should receive
antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing high-risk procedures, such as dental procedures, and procedures on
respiratory tract or infected skin, skin structures, or musculoskeletal tissue.[50]

Mitral stenosis Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients with mitral stenosis should be seen in follow-up once a year to evaluate for changes in symptoms
and to determine if pulmonary hypertension is developing.[22] [23]
If history and physical exam detect a change in the patient's condition, repeat echocardiography to
determine changes in stenosis severity and pulmonary pressure is indicated.
For patients receiving warfarin, standard international normalized ratio determination with appropriate
adjustment is recommended every 6 weeks.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atrial fibrillation long term high
Left atrial enlargement and increased age commonly cause atrial fibrillation in patients with mitral stenosis.
Treatment involves correction of the abnormal rate/rhythm, along with anticoagulation.
stroke long term high
The yearly risk of thromboembolism, often causing stroke, may be as high as 15% in the patient with mitral
stenosis and atrial fibrillation.[46] [47] [48]
The combination of flow stasis caused by the stenotic valve and loss of mechanical propulsion from a
fibrillating left atrium leads to thrombus formation, potential embolization, and stroke.
If embolization occurs despite adequate anticoagulation with warfarin, aspirin can be added to the
regimen.[49]
Although the role of mechanical relief of mitral obstruction in preventing subsequent stroke is unknown,
many would advocate mechanical therapy once the stroke patient is stable.
warfarin-induced hemorrhage long term medium
If bleeding occurs while the patient's INR is in the recommended 2.5 to 3.5 range, the bleeding source
should be sought and treated directly.
If bleeding occurs while the patient is overanticoagulated, the warfarin should be reversed by
administration of vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma while the source of the bleeding is sought and treated.
infective endocarditis long term low
Although all damaged valves have the potential to become infected, infective endocarditis in mitral stenosis
is relatively rare.
Once it is identified, standard antibiotic therapy for 4 to 6 weeks is the usual therapy.[50]

Mitral stenosis Follow up
Prognosis
With recognition of the proper use of anticoagulants and of the proper timing of mechanical intervention,
prognosis is excellent.[30] In one study, the 12-year survival was 82%.[31] However, for patients with
advanced symptoms and/or pulmonary hypertension treated medically the average survival is about 3
years.[45]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To

quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
