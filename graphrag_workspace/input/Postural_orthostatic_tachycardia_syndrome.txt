Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Overview
Summary
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms of
orthostatic intolerance and an increase in heart rate (without orthostatic hypotension) on standing, in the
absence of other causes. It is also associated with comorbidities such as migraine headaches, irritable
bowel syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and autoimmune diseases such as
Hashimoto thyroiditis and celiac disease.
Initial investigations should include an ECG and blood tests to look for other causes of symptoms, such as
anemia, hyperthyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Further investigation (e.g., Holter monitor, tilt-table test,
echocardiogram) may be needed if the diagnosis is unclear, or other causes are suspected.
First-line management of POTS symptoms is avoidance of triggers (e.g., exposure to excessive heat,
prolonged standing), and lifestyle modifications (e.g., increase in water and salt intake, use of compression
garments). If symptoms of POTS persist, pharmacologic treatment should be started to target specific
symptoms; a combination of medications is usually required.
There is a lack of evidence for effective treatments for POTS in children. However, it is reasonable to treat
children with the same interventions that are recommended for adults, with a focus on promoting salt and
fluid intake, physical counterpressure techniques, and reassurance to the patient and their families.
Definition
POTS is a chronic, multisystem disorder that is thought to be due to an autoimmune process. It is
characterized by frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance that improve rapidly when the patient returns
to a supine position, interfere with daily living activities, and have continued for at least 3 months, and an
increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm in patients ages 12 to 19 years) within 10 minutes of standing
from a supine position or head-up tilt (without orthostatic hypotension) that is not due to other causes of sinus
tachycardia.[1] [2] [3] [4] However, it is undefined in patients ages <12 years, although they may present with
similar symptoms.[1]

THEORY
Epidemiology
The prevalence of POTS is estimated to be between 0.1% and 1%, although the data are unclear.[1] [3][4] [8]
[9]
It is more common in women than men, with a female to male ratio of 4:1.[1] [2] [8] Most patients who
present with POTS are typically young women ages 15 to 25 years.[2] [10] POTS can occur outside of
this age range, but new onset POTS is rare after age 50.[2] Patients <12 years may present with similar
symptoms to older patients, particularly if there is a family history of POTS.[1] However, POTS remains
undefined in patients <12 years and the sensitivity and specificity of the heart rate criteria in this age group is
not established.[1]
Etiology
POTS is typically triggered by an event involving immunologic stress.[1] A viral infection (often upper
respiratory or gastrointestinal) is the most common precipitant and is reported in 20% to 50% of patients.[1]
[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Pathogens commonly linked to POTS include severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Epstein Barr virus.[16] Other precipitants include physical trauma (such as
concussion), menarche, pregnancy, and surgery.[1] [11] [13] [17] Hormonal changes during pregnancy affect
peripheral vascular resistance and blood volume, which may trigger orthostatic intolerance, particularly early
in pregnancy (i.e., the first trimester).[18]
Patients may also have a genetic disposition for POTS.[1] [11] There is increased prevalence (up to 14%) of
POTS in family members of affected people compared with the general population.[1] [11] Although there is
no evidence for a single causative gene, polymorphisms in many genes have been identified in several case
series.[1] [19] [20]
Pathophysiology
Several different pathophysiologic mechanisms for POTS have been proposed, although these are poorly
understood.[1] [4] These mechanisms overlap and a patient may often have features of more than one
mechanism.[1] [4]
Immune dysfunction
Immune dysfunction may play a role in POTS.[1] Many patients with POTS report an infectious prodrome
before the onset of orthostatic symptoms.[1] [11] [13] In addition, patients with POTS and their close relatives
have a higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders such as celiac disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Sjogren
syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus than the general population.[21] [22] [23] [24]
A few studies have reported that some patients with POTS have elevated levels of autoantibodies, which act
as partial agonists to alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.[25] [26] [27] This may cause the typical postural
and cardiovascular features seen in POTS.[28] Despite these findings, a definite link between autoantibodies
and POTS has not been established.[1]
Abnormal cardiovascular physiology
Some 70% of patients with POTS have absolute hypovolemia, with low plasma and red blood cell volume.[1]
[2] [4][5] [6] Hypovolemia in POTS is due to impaired regulation of plasma volume, which occurs as a result

of reduced ability of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to expand the blood volume.[1][2] [6][29] [30]
[31] Hypovolemia causes reduced systemic venous return and reduced cardiac output, with subsequent
reflex tachycardia and orthostatic intolerance.[6] [7]
Many patients with POTS also have reduced left ventricular mass, low stroke volume, and impaired cardiac
filling due to cardiovascular deconditioning, which can further contribute to hypovolemia and symptoms of
POTS.[1] [2] However, it is unclear whether cardiovascular deconditioning is a primary cause of POTS, or
caused by avoidance of exercise due to orthostatic symptoms.[2]
Excessive sympathetic activation
Patients with hyperadrenergic POTS may have abnormally increased sympathetic activity and circulating
catecholamine excess.[1] [2]
Peripheral autonomic dysfunction
Many patients with POTS have peripheral autonomic denervation, which leads to venous pooling, relative
central hypovolemia, and low blood volume (absolute hypovolemia).[1] [2] [4] This is particularly seen with
neuropathic POTS.
Classification
Types of POTS
Hypovolemic
Up to 70% of patients with POTS have absolute hypovolemia, with low plasma and red blood cell volume.[1]
[2][5] [6] Hypovolemia causes reduced systemic venous return and reduced cardiac output, with subsequent
reflex tachycardia and orthostatic intolerance.[6] [7]
Hyperadrenergic
Hyperadrenergic POTS is associated with increased sympathetic response and excess circulating
catecholamine.[1] [2] Patients will have orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure ≥10
mmHg after standing for 10 minutes).[2]
Neuropathic
Neuropathic POTS is associated with peripheral venous pooling and reduced effective intravascular volume,
which is caused by peripheral sympathetic denervation.[1][2]
POTS and related syndromes
A position statement by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society has proposed a different framework to current
US guidelines for classifying POTS and its related syndromes, on the basis of limitations of the current
nomenclature and overdiagnosis of POTS.[4]

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Theory
THEORY
• The patient should have significant orthostatic symptoms, which should be dominant in the clinical
presentation and get better with a supine position. There are no specific cardinal symptoms, and no
minimum number of symptoms required for diagnosis.[4]
POTS plus
• The patient must meet all the criteria for POTS - see "POTS" above.[4]
• In addition, the patient should have one or more debilitating noncardiovascular symptom(s).[4]
• The patient may also have additional associated comorbidities, such as migraine headaches or Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome. These comorbidities and the POTS symptoms may or may not have a common
underlying cause.[4]
Postural symptoms without tachycardia (PSWT)
• The patient has symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, but does not meet the criteria for POTS - see
"POTS" above. There may be lots of underlying causes for the patient’s symptoms.[4]
PSWT plus
• The patient has symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, but does not meet the criteria for POTS - see
"POTS" above. There may be lots of underlying causes for the patient’s symptoms.[4]
• In addition, the patient should have one or more debilitating noncardiovascular symptom(s).[4]
• The patient may also have additional associated comorbidities, such as migraine headaches or Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome. These comorbidities and the POTS symptoms may or may not have a common
underlying cause.[4]
Postural tachycardia of other cause
• The patient meets the criteria for POTS (see "POTS" above) with the exception that there is a clear,
secondary underlying cause for their symptoms.[4]
Asymptomatic orthostatic tachycardia
• The patient meets the criteria for POTS (see "POTS" above) but with the exception that they are
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.[4]
Inappropriate sinus tachycardia
• Defined as sinus heart rate >100 bpm at rest (with a mean 24-hour heart rate >90 bpm), that is not
due to a primary underlying cause, and is associated with distressing symptoms of palpitations.[4]

Case history
Case history #1
A 20-year-old woman presents with 4 months of fatigue, brain fog, and palpitations and lightheadedness
on standing up. Prior to this, the patient was diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis. The patient reports
occasional migraine headaches in the past but no other significant medical history. Physical examination
shows a supine heart rate of 85 bpm and blood pressure of 105/60 mmHg. After 1 minute of standing, her
heart rate is 123 bpm and blood pressure is 97/ 62 mmHg. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.
Case history #2
A 13-year-old girl presents with a 5-month history of standing intolerance due to palpitations and severe
dizziness. Her symptoms resolve after lying flat. The patient also reports occasional nausea, bloating,
and constipation. Her periods started 6 months ago and she also has a history of poor wound healing. On
examination she has stretch marks on her skin, hyperextensibility, and joint hypermobility. Her supine vital
signs show her heart rate is 89 bpm and blood pressure is 105/59 mmHg. On standing, her heart rate is
132 bpm and her blood pressure is 102/65 mmHg.

DIAGNOSIS
Approach
General principles
Diagnose POTS if a patient has:[1] [2] [3]
• Frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance when standing that:
• Interfere with daily living activities
• Improve rapidly when they return to a supine position
• Have continued for at least 3 months
and
• An increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm in patients ages 12 to 19 years old) within 10
minutes of standing from a supine position or head-up tilt (without orthostatic hypotension) that is
not due to other causes of sinus tachycardia.[1][2] [4]
In addition, identify any comorbidities commonly associated with POTS, and exclude other differentials.[1]
History
Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance include:
• Palpitations[1][2][3][4]
• Lightheadedness[1][3][4]
• Blurred vision[1]
• Exercise intolerance (which may also be a non-orthostatic feature of POTS)[2][4]
• Presyncope and syncope[2]
• Tremor[1][2][4]
• Generalized weakness[1][2]
• Fatigue (which may also be a non-orthostatic feature of POTS).[1][2][3][4]
However, be aware that symptoms of POTS are not limited to changes in posture. Non-orthostatic
symptoms include:
• Dyspnea[11] [32][33]
• Gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain[1]
[2][3][4] [34]
• Exercise intolerance[1][2][4]
• Fatigue[1][2][3][4]
• Headache[1][2][3][4]
• Sleep disturbance[2][3][4]
• Cognitive impairment[1][4]
• Chest pain[1][4]
• Bladder disturbance.[35] [36]
Determine the duration of the patient’s symptoms; for a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have lasted
for at least 3 months.[1]
Ask about risk factors for POTS, which include:
• Recent viral infection (present in around 50% of patients)[4] [37]
• Pregnancy[4]

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Diagnosis
• Relevant associated comorbidities, such as migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, asthma, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune diseases,
particularly Hashimoto thyroiditis and celiac disease.[1] [4] [13][38][39] [40]
Check for features of other conditions that may explain the patient’s symptoms. See Differentials .
Physical exam
Check the patient’s heart rate and blood pressure while they are supine and then standing.[2] This is
known as the 10-minute standing test.
• The patient’s heart rate will typically increase by ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm in patients ages 12 to
19 years old) after changing position from supine to standing, with no orthostatic hypotension
(sustained drop in systolic blood pressure by ≥20 mmHg).[1][2] [3][4]
• Allow at least 5 minutes of a supine position and at least 1 minute of standing before checking
orthostatic vital signs.[40] If there is no significant variation in the patient’s heart rate after 1 minute
of standing, repeat the standing heart rate and blood pressure check at 3, 5, and 10 minutes.[40]
• Note that changes in heart rate are often not apparent after 1 minute of standing in practice. A
common mistake is to focus on the changes in heart rate after 1 minute of standing only, rather
than the full 10 minutes, which can lead to misdiagnosis.
• Be aware that some patients have hyperadrenergic POTS, and have increased sympathetic
response and excess circulating catecholamine.[1] [2] Patients with hyperadrenergic POTS will
have orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure ≥10 mmHg after standing for 10
minutes).[2]
Undertake a careful cardiac examination to rule out significant structural heart disease.[1]
Examine the patient for other associated comorbidities, which include:[1]
• Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
• Autoimmune diseases, particularly Hashimoto thyroiditis and celiac disease.
If the patient has an atypical presentation, examine for neurologic diseases that can sometimes be
associated with POTS, such as Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy,
although these are uncommon.[41]
Initial investigations
Electrocardiogram
Perform a 12-lead ECG in all patients, to rule out other causes of a patient’s symptoms.[1][2][4]

Blood tests
Order tests to rule out other causes of the patient’s presentation, which should include thyroid function
tests, morning serum cortisol level, and complete blood count.[1][2] [4] [42] In addition, order electrolytes
to rule out causes such as adrenal insufficiency.[1] [4] In practice, electrolytes should also be checked
after starting certain pharmacologic treatments for POTS, such as fludrocortisone or desmopressin.
Other investigations
Holter monitor
Consider a 24-hour Holter monitor, which can help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the
association between tachycardia and orthostatic changes.[2] A Holter monitor can also rule out
supraventricular arrhythmias that may have a similar presentation to POTS.[2]
Tilt-table test
Organize a tilt-table test if:
• The diagnosis is unclear after the initial assessment of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate
and you have a high suspicion of POTS.[2] In this scenario, a tilt-table test is helpful because it will
provide an assessment of vital signs over a greater time period compared with a simple 10-minute
standing test

OR
• The patient is not able to perform a 10-minute standing test.[1]
Echocardiogram
Organize echocardiogram to exclude heart failure as a differential if you suspect this from the history or
there are signs of ventricular dysfunction found on exam (e.g., pitting edema of the lower extremities,
distended jugular veins).[2][4]
Further investigation
If the patient’s symptoms do not resolve or significantly improve, consider referral to a center experienced
with the autonomic testing of POTS, where available, to organize further investigation of the underlying
pathology.[2] However, further investigation should not be performed routinely because the significance
for patient management and outcome is unclear.[2] Further investigations include: 
• Supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level[2]
• Should be considered if hyperadrenergic POTS is suspected.[43]
• Thermoregulatory sweat test[2]
• Detects autonomic neuropathy which is associated with POTS.[2]
• Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test[42]
• Should be considered if neuropathic POTS is suspected.[42] Neuropathic POTS is
associated with peripheral venous pooling and reduced effective intravascular volume, which
is caused by peripheral sympathetic denervation.[1][2]
• Valsalva maneuver and deep breathing test with hemodynamic monitoring[2][4]
• Can detect autonomic dysfunction.[4]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
orthostatic tachycardia (common)
• Check the patient’s heart rate and blood pressure while they are supine and then standing.[2] This is
known as the 10-minute standing test.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Be aware that some patients have hyperadrenergic POTS, and have increased sympathetic
response and excess circulating catecholamine.[1] [2] Patients with hyperadrenergic POTS will
have orthostatic hypertension (increase in systolic blood pressure ≥10 mmHg after standing for
10 minutes).[2]
orthostatic palpitations (common)
• A key orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1] [2] [3][4] Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing
and improve rapidly when the patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] A patient with POTS may
report palpitations even if they have a normal heart rate, particularly if they are taking negative
chronotropic medications (e.g., beta-blockers, ivabradine). For a diagnosis of POTS, orthostatic
symptoms should occur frequently and have lasted for at least 3 months.[1]
presence of risk factors (common)
• Consider POTS if a patient presents with relevant symptoms and signs and particularly if they have
any of the following risk factors:
• • Age 15 to 25 years[2]
• Female sex[1] [2]
• Recent viral infection[16]
• Pregnancy[18]
• Relevant associated comorbidities, such as migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome,
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, or autoimmune diseases (particularly
Hashimoto thyroiditis and celiac disease).[1]
Other diagnostic factors
orthostatic lightheadedness (common)
• An orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1] [3][4] It occurs due to rapid heart rate and hypoperfusion on
standing. Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing and improve rapidly when the patient
returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of POTS, the patient should also have an increase
in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing from a supine position or head-up tilt, without
orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms should occur frequently and have lasted for at least
3 months.[1] [2][4]
orthostatic blurred vision (common)
• An orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1] Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing and improve
rapidly when the patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of POTS, the patient should
also have an increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing from a supine position
or head-up tilt, without orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms should occur frequently and
have lasted for at least 3 months.[1] [2][4]
exercise intolerance (common)
• Can be an orthostatic or non-orthostatic feature of POTS.[1] [2][4] Postexercise malaise is a frequently
reported symptom. Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing and improve rapidly when the
patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of POTS, the patient should also have an
increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing from a supine position or head-up tilt,
without orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms should occur frequently and have lasted for
at least 3 months.[1] [2][4]

orthostatic presyncope (common)
• Presyncope is an orthostatic symptom of POTS.[2] It occurs due to rapid heart rate and hypoperfusion
while standing. Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing and improve rapidly when the
patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of POTS, the patient should also have an
increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing from a supine position or head-up tilt,
without orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms should occur frequently and have lasted for
at least 3 months.[1] [2][4]
orthostatic tremor (common)
• Tremor is an orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1][2][4] Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when
standing and improve rapidly when the patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of
POTS, the patient should also have an increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing
from a supine position or head-up tilt, without orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms
should occur frequently and have lasted for at least 3 months.[1] [2][4]
orthostatic generalized weakness (common)
• Generalized weakness is an orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1] [2] Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur
when standing and improve rapidly when the patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis
of POTS, the patient should also have an increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of
standing from a supine position or head-up tilt, without orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic
symptoms should occur frequently and have lasted for at least 3 months.[1] [2][4]
dyspnea (common)
• A common non-orthostatic feature of POTS, which is mostly associated with dysfunctional
breathing.[32] Cohort studies suggest that dyspnea may be present in at least 65% of patients with
POTS.[11] [33]
orthostatic syncope (uncommon)
• Syncope is an orthostatic symptom of POTS.[2] It may occur due to excessive tachycardia and
transient hypoperfusion while standing. Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing and
improve rapidly when the patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of POTS, the
patient should also have an increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing from a
supine position or head-up tilt, without orthostatic hypotension, and orthostatic symptoms should occur
frequently and have lasted for at least 3 months.[1] [2][4]
bloating (uncommon)
• A gastrointestinal feature of POTS.[2] [3][4] Gastrointestinal symptoms are occasionally reported by
people with POTS and may be due to autonomic dysfunction, or associated irritable bowel disease or
celiac disease.[34] For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have lasted for at least 3 months.[1]
nausea (uncommon)
• A gastrointestinal feature of POTS, which can be accompanied by fainting and migraines.[2] [3]
[4] Gastrointestinal symptoms are occasionally reported by people with POTS and may be due to

celiac disease. For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have lasted for at least 3 months.[1]
fatigue (uncommon)
• Can be an orthostatic or non-orthostatic feature of POTS.[1] [2] [3][4] The patient may describe muscle
fatigue and low energy. Orthostatic symptoms of POTS occur when standing and improve rapidly when
the patient returns to a supine position.[1] [2] For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have lasted
for at least 3 months.[1]
headache (uncommon)
• A non-orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1] [2] [3][4] For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have
lasted for at least 3 months.[1]
sleep disturbance (uncommon)
• A non-orthostatic symptom of POTS.[2] [3][4] For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have lasted
for at least 3 months.[1]
cognitive impairment (uncommon)
• A non-orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1][4] For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms should have lasted for
at least 3 months.[1]
chest pain (uncommon)
• Can be an orthostatic or non-orthostatic symptom of POTS.[1][4] For a diagnosis of POTS, symptoms
should have lasted for at least 3 months.[1]
bladder disturbance (uncommon)
• Can be a non-orthostatic feature of POTS.[35] [36] Symptoms can include nocturia and urgency.[36]

young age (15 to 25 years)
• Most patients who present with POTS are typically young women ages 15 to 25 years.[2] [10]
 However, POTS can occur outside of this age range, although new onset POTS is rare after age 50.[2]
 Patients <12 years may present with similar symptoms to older patients, particularly if there is a family
history of POTS.[1] However, POTS remains undefined in patients <12 years and the sensitivity and
specificity of the heart rate criteria in this age group is not established.[1]
female sex
• POTS is more common in women than men and has a female to male ratio of 4:1.[1] [2]
recent viral infection
• Many patients with POTS report recent febrile illness, which suggests an autoimmune process may be
responsible for causing orthostatic symptoms.[1]
• Pathogens commonly linked to POTS include SARS-CoV-2 and Epstein Barr virus.[16]
pregnancy
• Hormonal changes during pregnancy affect peripheral vascular resistance and blood volume, which
may trigger orthostatic intolerance, particularly early in pregnancy (i.e., the first trimester).[18]
associated comorbidities
• The most commonly associated comorbidities are:[1]
• • Migraine headaches (40%)[4]
• Irritable bowel syndrome (30%)
• Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (25%)[4]
• Chronic fatigue syndrome (21%)[4]
• Autoimmune diseases (20%), particularly Hashimoto thyroiditis and celiac disease.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Management
Approach
The goal of therapeutic interventions for POTS is to improve symptoms by:[1]
• Expanding intravascular volume
• Reducing peripheral venous pooling
• Exerting a negative chronotropic effect and lowering heart rate.
A multidisciplinary approach is important to manage the widespread symptoms of POTS.[4]
Avoidance of triggers and lifestyle modifications is the first management step for all patients, before
pharmacologic therapy if symptoms persist.[1] [2] Note that these treatments are for management of
orthostatic symptoms of POTS. Offer symptomatic relief of any associated non-orthostatic symptoms (e.g.,
gastrointestinal symptoms) and involve other specialties as necessary, because these will not usually
respond to the standard treatments for POTS.
It is reasonable to treat children with the same interventions that are recommended for adults, with a focus
on promoting salt and fluid intake, physical counterpressure techniques, and reassurance to the patient
and their families.[2] However, erythropoietin, modafinil, octreotide, and beta-blockers are only used on rare
occasions under specialist guidance, and bupropion and droxidopa are not recommended in children.
In pregnancy, avoid pharmacologic therapy where possible and check the safety of specific drugs
carefully.[53] In particular, note that ivabradine is not recommended in pregnancy as it may cause fetal harm.
Managing the symptoms of POTS is key because they can significantly compromise a patient’s quality of life,
and negatively impact their ability to advance in their education and career.[1] [8] In general, there is a lack
of medium- or long-term evidence for effective treatments for patients with POTS, particularly children, and
managing symptoms can be challenging.[2] [4] However, some evidence is emerging for certain treatments,
particularly ivabradine, increasing salt intake, and compression.[54] [55][56] [57] [58] [59] [60]
Avoidance of triggers
Advise the patient to avoid triggers for POTS symptoms.[4] These triggers include:
• Exposure to excessive heat[2]
• Prolonged standing[2]
• Medications that exacerbate intravascular depletion (e.g., diuretics), afterload reduction (e.g.,
ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists), or sinus and orthostatic tachycardia (e.g.,
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as atomoxetine)[1] [2] [4]
• Excessive alcohol intake and exercise[1] [2]
• Recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamines).[61]
Lifestyle modifications and management of comorbidities
In addition to avoiding triggers, advise the patient to make the following lifestyle modifications:
• Increase intake of water and salt to optimize intravascular volume.[1] [2] [4] [59]
• Advise the patient to aim to consume at least 2 to 3 liters of water and up to 10 g of salt
every day (1 teaspoon of salt is approximately equivalent to 2.3 g).[1] [2] [4] [59] However,
in practice, increased salt intake is an inappropriate treatment for certain patients, such as
those with hypertension, or kidney or cardiovascular disease.

MANAGEMENT
• Use waist-high compression stockings with an abdominal binder to reduce venous pooling in their
lower extremities and splanchnic circulation.[1] [2] [60]
• If this is not tolerated, the patient could use waist-high compressions without abdominal
binder or an abdominal binder alone.[1][4] [62]
• Undertake graded exercise training.[1] [2] [4]
• Advise the patient to start with supine progressive aerobic and leg resistance training then
progress to upright exercises (e.g., rowing machines and static exercise bikes).[1] [2]
• However, be aware that some patients won’t tolerate graded exercise training until
pharmacologic therapy has been started and adequate symptom control is achieved.[63] In
practice, if a patient can’t tolerate graded exercise training as a first-line nonpharmacologic
approach, reattempt this after starting pharmacologic treatment.
• Physical counterpressure techniques (in children).[2]
Ensure any comorbidities are managed appropriately.[4] Treat any additional features, such as poor
mental health, disturbed sleep, and headache, to improve the patient’s overall level of functioning and
quality of life.
Initial pharmacologic treatment
Start pharmacologic treatment if the patient’s symptoms persist despite nonpharmacologic measures.
• Be aware that there are no medications that have been approved for the treatment of POTS.
• Medication can be given as monotherapy, but a combination of medications is usually required.
Concomitant use of beta-blockers and clonidine is usually avoided. If these drugs are used
together, monitor heart rate and blood pressure.
• Non-orthostatic symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal symptoms) do not usually improve with these
pharmacologic treatments, so further symptomatic relief and involvement of other specialties as
appropriate may also be required in practice.
Target pharmacologic treatment to manage the patient’s specific symptoms associated with POTS.[2]
These include:
• Intravascular volume expansion:
• Options include fludrocortisone or desmopressin.[2] [4] [64][65] [66]
• Note that evidence for efficacy of fludrocortisone for POTS is limited, but some
trials have shown it can be effective for vasovagal syncope.[1] [2] [64] Ensure that
patients are on a high sodium diet and that their potassium level is monitored.[1]
Pharmacodynamic effects of fludrocortisone may only last 1 to 2 days.[2]
• A small randomized crossover study showed that desmopressin improved tachycardia
and POTS symptoms in adult patients.[66]
• Reduction of peripheral venous pooling:
• Midodrine is an option.[2] [56] [57] Some small studies have shown benefit in patients with
POTS, particularly if they have neuropathic POTS, and also for vasovagal syncope.[56] [57]
[58]
• Exertion of a negative chronotropic effect and lowering of heart rate:
• Options include beta-blockers or ivabradine.[1] [2] [4] [67] These drugs are preferred in
patients with hyperadrenergic POTS.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Management
• A recent clinical trial found no difference in efficacy between the beta-blockers propranolol
and bisoprolol.[68] In practice, labetalol is generally avoided as a standard treatment for
POTS, except for patients with hyperadrenergic POTS. Labetalol is safe to use in pregnancy. 
• Some evidence shows that ivabradine is an effective treatment for POTS, and lowers heart
rate without affecting blood pressure.[54] [69] However, note that it is not recommended in
pregnancy as it may cause fetal harm.
• Neuroenhancement:
• Pyridostigmine is an option.[2] [70] [71] In practice, this may also be useful if the patient is
experiencing constipation as a predominant non-orthostatic symptom of POTS.
• Treatment of prominent hyperadrenergic features:
• Clonidine is an option.[2] [4]
• Treatment of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction:
• Modafinil is an option.[2]
Salvage therapy for refractory symptoms
If a patient’s symptoms do not improve with initial pharmacotherapy, they may benefit from adding one of
the following treatments for salvage therapy:
• Bupropion (but be aware that this should not be used in children because it can increase the risk of
suicidal thoughts)[72]
• Erythropoietin (epoetin alfa)[73] [74]
• Octreotide [74] [75]
• Droxidopa (not recommended in children)[74] [76]
• Intermittent intravenous saline infusion[2] [4] [77]
• Intravenous saline may be useful for patients who are clinically decompensated with
worsening symptoms.[2]
• However, regular or long-term infusions are not recommended, because insertion of a
chronic central venous catheter is usually required, which puts the patient at risk of catheter-
related complications.[2]

depletion (e.g., diuretics), afterload
reduction (e.g., ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin-II receptor antagonists), or
sinus and orthostatic tachycardia (e.g.,
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as

Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» In addition to avoiding triggers, advise
the patient to make the following lifestyle
modifications:
• Increase intake of water and salt to
optimize intravascular volume.[1] [2] [4]
[59] Advise the patient to aim to consume
at least 2 to 3 liters of water and up to 10
g of salt every day (1 teaspoon of salt is
approximately equivalent to 2.3 g).[1] [2]
[4] [59] However, in practice, increased
salt intake is an inappropriate treatment
for certain patients, such as those with
hypertension, or kidney or cardiovascular
disease.
• Use waist-high compression stockings
with an abdominal binder to reduce
venous pooling in their lower extremities
and splanchnic circulation.[1] [2] [60] If
this is not tolerated, the patient could
use waist-high compressions without
abdominal binder or an abdominal binder
alone.[1][4] [62]

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
Acute
• Undertake graded exercise training.[1] [2]
[4] Advise the patient to start with supine
progressive aerobic and leg resistance
training then progress to upright exercises
(e.g., rowing machines and static exercise
bikes).[1] [2] However, be aware that some
patients won’t tolerate graded exercise
training until pharmacologic therapy has
been started and adequate symptom
control is achieved.[63] In practice, if a
patient can’t tolerate graded exercise
training as a first-line nonpharmacologic
approach, reattempt this after starting
pharmacologic treatment.
• Physical counterpressure techniques (in
children).[2]
» Ensure any comorbidities are managed
appropriately.[4] Treat any additional features,
such as poor mental health, disturbed sleep, and
headache, to improve the patient’s overall level
of functioning and quality of life.

» A multidisciplinary approach is important to
manage the widespread symptoms of POTS.[4]
» Start pharmacologic treatment if the patient’s
symptoms persist despite nonpharmacologic
measures.
• Be aware that there are no medications
that have been approved for the treatment
of POTS.
• Medication can be given as monotherapy,
but a combination of medications is
usually required.
• In pregnancy, avoid pharmacologic
therapy where possible and check the
safety of specific drugs carefully.[53]
 In particular, note that ivabradine is not
recommended in pregnancy as it may
cause fetal harm.
• It is reasonable to treat children
with the same interventions that are
recommended for adults, with a focus
on promoting salt and fluid intake,
physical counterpressure techniques,
and reassurance to the patient and their
families.[2] Pharmacologic treatment
may be used. However, erythropoietin,
modafinil, octreotide, and beta-blockers
are only used on rare occasions under
specialist guidance.
• Non-orthostatic symptoms (e.g.,
gastrointestinal symptoms) do not usually
improve with these pharmacologic
treatments, so further symptomatic relief
and involvement of other specialties
as appropriate may also be required in
practice.
» Target pharmacologic treatment to manage
the patient’s specific symptoms associated with
POTS.[2] These include the following:

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
Acute
» Intravascular volume expansion:
• Options include fludrocortisone or
desmopressin.[2] [4] [64][65] [66]
• Note that evidence for efficacy of
fludrocortisone for POTS is limited,
but some trials have shown it can be
effective for vasovagal syncope.[1] [2]
[64] Ensure that patients are on a high
sodium diet and that their potassium level
is monitored.[1] Pharmacodynamic effects
of fludrocortisone may only last 1 to 2
days.[2]
• A small randomized crossover study
showed that desmopressin improved
tachycardia and POTS symptoms in adult
patients.[66]
» Reduction of peripheral venous pooling:
• Midodrine is an option.[2] [56] [57] Some
small studies have shown benefit in
patients with POTS, particularly if they
have neuropathic POTS, and also for
vasovagal syncope.[56] [57] [58]
» Exertion of a negative chronotropic effect and
lowering of heart rate:
• Options include beta-blockers or
ivabradine.[1] [2] [4] [67] These drugs are
preferred in patients with hyperadrenergic
POTS. 
• A recent clinical trial found no difference
in efficacy between the beta-blockers
propranolol and bisoprolol.[68] In practice,
labetalol is generally avoided as a
standard treatment for POTS, except for
patients with hyperadrenergic POTS.
Labetalol is safe to use in pregnancy. 
• Some evidence shows that ivabradine
is an effective treatment for POTS, and
lowers heart rate without affecting blood
pressure.[54] [69] However, note that it is
not recommended in pregnancy as it may
cause fetal harm.
» Neuroenhancement:
• Pyridostigmine is an option.[2] [70] [71]
 In practice, this may also be useful if the
patient is experiencing constipation as a
predominant non-orthostatic symptom of
POTS.
» Treatment of prominent hyperadrenergic
features:
• Clonidine is an option.[2] [4]
» Treatment of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction:
• Modafinil is an option.[2]

Emerging
Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)
Some low-quality evidence has shown that IVIG may be beneficial for patients with refractory POTS by
neutralizing pathogenic autoantibodies.[1] [78] [79] [80]
Secondary prevention
To prevent flares or recurrence of POTS symptoms, advise patients to continue to avoid triggers and
undertake appropriate lifestyle medications.[4] See Patient discussions .
Patient discussions
Advise all patients to:
• Avoid exposure to extreme heat, prolonged standing, medications that exacerbate intravascular
depletion (e.g., diuretics) or sinus and orthostatic tachycardia (e.g., norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors such as atomoxetine), afterload reduction medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-
II receptor antagonists), excessive alcohol and exercise, and recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine,
methamphetamines).[1] [2] [4] [61]
• Drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water per day.[1] [2]

Monitoring
Monitoring
In the absence of robust evidence, monitoring in POTS is based on clinical practice, which may vary
between organizations; check your local protocols.
Organize a follow-up appointment 8 weeks after starting nonpharmacologic measures, or starting or
changing pharmacologic treatment.
Check:
• Electrolytes at 1 week, and 1 month following initiation of fludrocortisone or desmopressin
• CBC after 1 week, and then monthly after starting erythropoietin.
Consider loop recorder implantation for certain patients. The purpose of loop recorder implantation is to
look for causes of a patient’s symptoms other than POTS, and to monitor the patient for bradycardia or
sinus pauses if the patient has syncope. Therefore, schedule loop recorder implantation if the patient:
• Has ongoing symptoms that do not respond to treatment
• Reports symptoms suggestive of supraventricular tachycardia or frequent syncope, without an
identifiable cardiac rhythm abnormality on an event monitor.
Consider 24-hour urinary sodium to assess for hypovolemia if the patient is not responding to treatment or
supplemental salt intake is suspected to be suboptimal.[4]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
negative impact on daily life long term high
Symptoms of POTS have a significant negative impact on a patient’s daily life, including:[1][8]
• Decreased ability to participate in education and work
• Reduced quality of life.
adverse effects of high salt intake variable low
Adverse effects of high salt intake, which is a treatment for POTS, include gastrointestinal upset,
hypertension, and edema.[74]
Prognosis
POTS is not associated with increased mortality compared with the general population.[2]
Around two-thirds of patients on pharmacologic treatment will experience an overall improvement in their
symptoms, and orthostatic symptoms tend to improve as the patient gets older.[8]

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
