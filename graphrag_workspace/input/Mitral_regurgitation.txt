Mitral regurgitation Overview
Summary
Mitral regurgitation (MR) may present with dyspnea, usually on exertion, palpitations, and/or decreased
exercise tolerance.
Typically, presents as a holosystolic blowing murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla.
Transthoracic echo is the diagnostic test of choice in identifying presence, severity, and mechanism of MR.
Color Doppler flow and continuous-wave Doppler studies can assess severity of regurgitation, left ventricular
dimensions, size and function of the right ventricle, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Management options include surgical repair or replacement and transcatheter mitral valve repair; the risks
and benefits of interventional options should be individually evaluated for each patient.
The most common complications of surgical treatment are failure of repair, prosthetic valve stenosis,
endocarditis, and mitral valve patient-prosthesis mismatch.
Definition
The mitral valve apparatus consists of anterior and posterior leaflets, chordae tendineae, anterolateral and
posteromedial papillary muscles, and mitral annulus. Any aberrations of the mitral valve apparatus, due
to mechanical, traumatic, infectious, degenerative, congenital, or metabolic causes, may lead to mitral
regurgitation (MR).
Mild to moderate disease can be asymptomatic for many years; however, with progression of the disease,
eccentric cardiac hypertrophy occurs, which leads to elongation of the myocardial fibers and increased left
ventricular end-diastolic volume. Eventually, prolonged volume overload leads to left ventricular dysfunction
and increased left ventricular end-systolic diameter.

Mitral regurgitation Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common types of valvular heart disease.[2] Although the exact
incidence and prevalence of MR is unknown, it has been suggested that the prevalence is 2% in the general
population and is more common with advancing age.[1] Primary MR accounts for an estimated 35% of
cases, while 65% of cases are secondary to dilation and heart failure.[3]
Etiology
The mitral valve apparatus consists of anterior and posterior leaflets, chordae tendineae, anterolateral and
posteromedial papillary muscles, and mitral annulus. To be inclusive, it also includes the atrial and ventricular
myocardium. Mitral valve dysfunction may result from aberrations of any portion of the mitral valve apparatus,
due to mechanical, traumatic, infectious, degenerative, congenital, or metabolic causes.
MR can be primary or secondary and either acute or chronic. Primary MR is a consequence of degenerative
disease of one or more components of the mitral valve; secondary MR is a consequence of annular dilatation
and distortion of the subvalvular apparatus secondary to left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, usually
associated with cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease.[1]
Typical causes of acute MR include infective endocarditis, ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture,
acute rheumatic fever, and acute dilation of the left ventricle due to myocarditis or ischemia.[4]
Common causes of chronic MR include those already listed as well as myxomatous degeneration of the
mitral leaflets or chordae tendineae, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral annular enlargement.

Pathophysiology
Chronic MR can be mild or moderate and can be asymptomatic for many years; however, with progression
of the disease to severe, eccentric cardiac hypertrophy occurs, which leads to elongation of the myocardial
fibers and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume. This is a compensatory mechanism, which allows
an increase in total stroke volume to maintain adequate cardiac output. Additionally, both left ventricular and
left atrial enlargement will accommodate the regurgitant volume at a lower filling pressure, which prevents
pulmonary congestion. In this stage of the disease, which may last for 7 to 10 years, patients are typically
asymptomatic. Eventually, prolonged volume overload leads to left ventricular dysfunction and increased left
ventricular end-systolic diameter. However, even in this phase of the disease, left ventricular ejection fraction
usually remains above 50% to 60%.[5]
Classification
Primary MR
A consequence of degenerative disease of one or more components of the mitral valve.[1]
Secondary MR
A consequence of annular dilatation and distortion of the subvalvular apparatus secondary to left ventricular
remodeling and dysfunction, usually associated with cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease.[1]

Mitral regurgitation Theory
THEORY
Acute MR
Results from acute disruption of mitral valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, or papillary muscles following
myocardial infarction, trauma, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, or other causes that suddenly disrupt
the mitral valve apparatus causing sudden changes in hemodynamics and symptoms.
There is no actual classification cutoff point between acute and chronic, because acute MR occurs suddenly
within seconds after chordal or papillary muscle rupture and results in immediate symptoms.
Chronic MR
Occurs over many years and results in volume overload and left ventricular dysfunction.
Case history
Case history #1
A 52-year-old woman presents with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and occasional palpitations. She has
no prior cardiac history. She denies chest pain, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower
extremity edema. On physical exam her jugular venous distension is around 12 cm and her lungs are
clear to auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals a slightly displaced apical impulse with a palpable P2. Cardiac
auscultation reveals III/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiates to the axilla with diminished S1
and P2 greater than A2.
Other presentations
Acute MR is serious and rare. It may occur in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and leads to high
left atrial pressure and pulmonary edema secondary to reduced left atrial compliance. It usually presents
as a sudden and marked increase in congestive heart failure symptoms, with weakness, fatigue, dyspnea,
and sometimes respiratory failure and shock. It is usually associated with peripheral vasoconstriction,
pallor, and diaphoresis. Occasionally no murmur is heard, because the lack of left atrial compliance leads
to equalization of pressures between the left atrium and ventricle midway through systole.
Chronic MR is associated with a laterally displaced apical impulse (with left ventricular dilation),
diminished S1, with or without S3, with or without right ventricular heave, and palpable P2 (if pulmonary
hypertension has developed).

Mitral regurgitation Diagnosis
Approach
Diagnosis and severity are established by symptoms and quantitative findings on echocardiography.[10] [11]
[12]
Presentation
There are no pathognomonic features to diagnose MR by history; however, dyspnea on exertion,
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, palpitations, fatigue, and diaphoresis
are common presenting symptoms.
Patients with acute MR may present with a sudden and marked increase in symptoms of congestive heart
failure, with weakness, fatigue, dyspnea, and sometimes respiratory failure and shock.
Physical exam
MR usually presents as a holosystolic, blowing murmur at the apex that radiates to the axilla. Chronic MR
is also associated with laterally displaced apical impulse (with left ventricular dilation) and diminished S1.
Transthoracic echocardiogram
This is the definitive test for determining the severity, mechanism, and presence of flail, left ventricular
size and function, left atrial size, other valvular abnormalities, and right ventricular systolic pressure.[10]
[11] [13] It is also useful for assessing serial changes in left ventricular size and function, and evaluating
the patient after a change in symptoms. Measurement of left ventricular global longitudinal strain may
provide earlier detection of systolic dysfunction than ejection fraction and evidence shows that it may have
incremental prognostic value in patients with primary MR treated with surgical repair.[10] [11] [14] [15]

Measures of flow
Spatial mapping, flow convergence, pulmonary vein velocity patterns, vena contracta width, continuous-
wave Doppler density and shape, and quantification of antegrade valvular flow volumes can be used to
further assess severity. A weighted average of multiple methods is often used.
Flow convergence method, also called the proximal isovelocity surface area method, involves looking
at the color images on the left ventricular side of the mitral regurgitant images.[16] [17] [18] [19] This
flow convergence zone is the location where the blood is accelerating to go across the regurgitant
orifice, as it undergoes a pressure drop from left ventricular pressure to left atrial pressure. Analysis
of this convergence zone when its shape is hemispheric allows estimation of the surface area of the
hemisphere; it calculates the actual size of the regurgitant lesion, a fundamental parameter of valve
integrity, which may be less load-dependent than other methods. A regurgitant orifice area over 0.4 cm² is
indicative of severe regurgitation, whereas <0.2 cm² is considered mild.
Pulmonary vein flow profiles are also useful for determining severity.[20] The normal pulmonary vein
pattern is to have flow velocity during ventricular systole higher than antegrade flow velocity during
diastole, a pattern that persists in mild and sometimes moderate MR. As the regurgitation progresses,
pulmonary vein systolic velocity becomes blunted, with systolic velocity less than diastolic velocity, and
sometimes with cessation of systolic flow. In patients with severe MR, systolic flow is often reversed, with
flow away from the left atrium during ventricular systole. This occurs due to the large V wave on left atrial
pressure and a transient reversal of flow back into the pulmonary parenchyma during ventricular systole.

Transesophageal echocardiogram
May be needed to better assess the severity and etiology in rare occasions where the degree of
symptoms does not match transthoracic echocardiogram findings.[10] [11] [21] Additionally, three-
dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram provides a surgical view of the mitral valve, which can help
the heart team discussion on intervention strategy.[10] [11] A stress echocardiogram is often useful for
determining the severity and impact of the disease on the patient's exercise hemodynamics.
ECG
All patients must undergo ECG exam as a routine screening as well as for any rhythm disturbance (e.g.,
atrial fibrillation).[13]
Cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
(CMR)
Cardiac catheterization is used when noninvasive evaluation is inconclusive or discordant with clinical
findings.[10] [11] It is also used to check for disease in coronary arteries. Patients suspected of having
pulmonary hypertension and/or poor left or right ventricular function should have cardiac catheterization to
calculate pulmonary artery pressures and determine level of pulmonary hypertension.

history of rheumatic heart disease
• Leads to leaflet thickening and valvular and subvalvular fibrosis, and various degrees of systolic and
diastolic restriction of leaflet motion.
• In most cases of restriction involving both leaflets, the jet of MR is central. In some patients, the
posterior leaflet is more restricted and the jet direction is posterior.
infective endocarditis
• There is leaflet or chordal disruption, flail, and perforations. These often cause MR with associated
nodular hypermobile densities (vegetations) that are the echocardiographic hallmarks of the disease.
history of cardiac trauma
• Sharp or blunt trauma may result in structural damage to the mitral valve apparatus.
history of myocardial infarction
• Myocardial infarction may result in structural damage to the mitral valve apparatus.
history of congenital heart disease
• Such as anterior mitral valve cleft, which is commonly associated with septum primum atrial septal
defect.
history of ischemic heart disease
• In the setting of myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease, the left ventricle undergoes
remodeling and enlargement, which leads to MR. This is caused by apical tethering of normal leaflets.
• The length of mitral tissue, including the leaflets, chordae, and papillary muscle, is fixed. As the left
ventricle dilates, often after myocardial infarction, the left ventricular wall and papillary muscles are
displaced outward, which tethers the joining surfaces of the mitral valve downward, reducing the
amount of leaflet tissue available for coaptation.
• In many cases, the result is a central, or in some cases a posterior, direction of the MR jet.

Mitral regurgitation Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• In rare cases, a focal infarction may cause elongation or disruption of the papillary muscle, leading
to excessive leaflet motion (often involving both leaflets), most commonly on the medial side of both
leaflets from medial papillary muscle abnormalities.
left ventricular systolic dysfunction
• The mechanism for this risk factor is the same as for ischemic heart disease.
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Caused by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.

anorectic/dopaminergic drugs
• Certain anorectic and other dopaminergic or serotonergic drugs such as ergotamine, pergolide, and
cabergoline have been shown to cause MR.
elevated systolic blood pressure
• Persistent elevated systolic blood pressure has been associated with an increased risk of mitral
regurgitation.[8] [9]

atrium. Transesophageal
echo may yield more detail
than transthoracic echo.
Laboratory evaluation may
reveal leukocytosis.
Criteria
Flow convergence method or proximal isovelocity surface area
(PISA)
Flow convergence method or PISA involves looking at the color images on the left ventricular side of
the mitral regurgitant images.[17] [18] [19] This flow convergence zone is the location where the blood
is accelerating to go across the regurgitant orifice, as it undergoes a pressure drop from left ventricular
pressure to left atrial pressure. With this area of flow acceleration, color Doppler tracks the location of
increases in velocity and shows this as a proximal zone of color aliasing. Analysis of this convergence zone
when its shape is hemispheric allows estimation of the surface area of the hemisphere, which is derived
from a measurement of the radius (R) and the aliasing velocity (V), numerically extracted from the color bar
reflecting machine settings. When this is combined with the maximum velocity, the size of the regurgitant
orifice can be calculated according to the formula 2PiR²V divided by maximum velocity through the valve
obtained by continuous-wave Doppler. The advantage of this formula is that it calculates the actual size of
the regurgitant lesion, a fundamental parameter of valve integrity, which may be less load-dependent than
other methods.
Severity
• A regurgitant orifice area >0.4 cm² is indicative of severe regurgitation, whereas <0.2 cm² is
considered mild.
• A regurgitant fraction of <30% is considered mild and >50% is considered severe.
• A regurgitant volume of <30 mL is considered mild and >60 mL is considered severe.

Mitral regurgitation Management
Approach
Management of MR requires involvement of a multidisciplinary heart team; the risks and benefits of
interventional options should be individually evaluated for each patient. It is important to determine whether
the patient has primary or secondary MR, as this will affect treatment decisions.
Acute severe MR
Acute severe MR presents as a medical emergency and immediate surgery is indicated.[10] Prior
to surgery, afterload reduction using an intravenous vasodilator infusion and/or intra-aortic balloon
counterpulsation may be required to stabilize the patient.[10]
Chronic severe primary MR: asymptomatic patients
There is no medical treatment for asymptomatic patients with chronic severe primary MR and preserved
left ventricular function that has been shown to improve clinical outcomes; however, these patients are
closely monitored and treated for relevant comorbidities such as hypertension.
Asymptomatic patients with severe MR are monitored with echocardiography every 6 to 12 months in an
effort to identify early signs of left ventricular dysfunction, which can become irreversible before the onset
of symptoms.[10] [11] For asymptomatic patients, surgical mitral valve repair or replacement is indicated if
the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ≤60% or the left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) is
≥40 mm.[1] [10] [11] [25] [26] [27]
In general, the threshold for surgical treatment of asymptomatic severe primary MR has been declining
because of significant success with mitral valve repair with low operative risk at primary or comprehensive
valve centers. Surgery may also be considered in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR
and normal LV systolic function (LVEF >60% and LVESD <40 mm) when there is a high likelihood of
durable repair (>95%) and a low surgical risk (<1%), or if there is a progressive increase in LV size or a
progressive decrease in ejection fraction on ≥3 serial imaging studies.[10] [27]
Surgical options include:
• Mitral valve repair[28]
• Mechanical valve replacement and anticoagulation or bioprosthetic valve replacement.[29]
When surgery is indicated but not possible or must be delayed, guideline-directed medical therapy for
systolic dysfunction may be considered.[10] Asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and no
indications for surgery may be managed with watchful waiting.[11] [27]
Chronic severe primary MR: symptomatic patients
The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines
recommend mitral valve surgery for symptomatic patients with severe chronic primary MR, regardless of
LV systolic function.[10] Note that the 2020 focused update of the 2017 ACC expert consensus decision
pathway on the management of mitral regurgitation restricts surgery to those with LVEF >30%.[27]
For patients with high or prohibitive surgical risk and severe symptoms (New York Heart Association
[NYHA] class III or IV), transcatheter mitral valve intervention (transcatheter edge-to-edge repair) may be
considered if mitral valve anatomy is favorable and the patient’s life expectancy is at least 1 year.[10] [11]

Mitral regurgitation Management
MANAGEMENT
When surgery is indicated but not possible or must be delayed, guideline-directed medical therapy for
systolic dysfunction may be considered.[10]
Patients who are refractory to medical therapy and not suitable for surgery or transcatheter repair
may receive extended heart failure management: for example, cardiac resynchronization therapy and
ventricular assist devices.[11]
Chronic severe secondary MR
All patients with symptomatic secondary MR should be treated with guideline-directed medical therapy
in consultation with a cardiologist expert in the management of heart failure, alongside cardiac
resynchronization therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation when indicated.[30] If symptoms persist
despite optimal medical management, mitral valve intervention may be indicated.[10] [11] [27]
For patients with severe secondary MR who are undergoing revascularization with coronary artery bypass
grafting, mitral valve surgery is reasonable concomitantly.[10] [11] [27]
Surgery should also be considered in severely symptomatic patients (NYHA class III or IV) with severe
secondary MR due to atrial annular dilation and LVEF greater than or equal to 50% when symptoms
persist despite therapy for heart failure and atrial fibrillation.[10] [27]
For those with LVEF less than 50% who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy,
transcatheter mitral valve repair or valve surgery may be considered.[10] [27] Transcatheter edge-to-edge
mitral valve repair is preferred for those with appropriate anatomy (LVEF 20% to 50%, LVESD ≤70 mm,
pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≤70 mmHg).

Secondary prevention
Patients with a history of prosthetic valve replacement, a previous history of infective endocarditis, select
patients with congenital heart disease, and cardiac transplant recipients are at high risk of developing
infective endocarditis. Therefore, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines
recommend that these patients receive antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures that involve:[10]
• Manipulation of gingival tissue
• Manipulation of the periapical region of teeth
• Perforation of the oral mucosa.
The guidelines further suggest that there is no evidence for infective endocarditis prophylaxis in
gastrointestinal procedures or genitourinary procedures where there is no known infection. However,
European guidelines recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis prior to at-risk dental
procedures, or invasive gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, musculoskeletal, or genitourinary procedures may
be offered, depending on the patient's risk profile.[37] See Infective endocarditis .

Monitoring
Asymptomatic patients are closely monitored for risk factors such as hypertension.
Post-treatment follow-up is necessary following mitral valve repair or replacement to assess the
effectiveness of the repair early. The recommended first visit is around 3 to 4 weeks after the operation
and then yearly in asymptomatic patients. Baseline echo is essential at 3 to 4 weeks.

Mitral regurgitation Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atrial fibrillation short term high
Occurs as the result of left atrial enlargement.
Treated with rate control and proper anticoagulation.
pulmonary hypertension short term high
Occurs as the result of left-sided failure and pressure overload.
Mitral valve repair or replacement is the only treatment.
postoperative stroke short term low
May be caused by manipulation of the ascending aorta.
prosthesis stenosis long term medium
May result from pannus formation or degenerative disease.
left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart
failure
variable high
There is an increase in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume as a compensatory mechanism in early
stages; however, as time progresses LV dysfunction occurs accompanied by impaired ejection and
increased end-systolic volume.
With time there may be further LV dilation and increased LV filling pressure. Eventually this leads to
reduced forward flow and increased LV filling pressure.
Mitral valve repair or replacement is the only treatment.[36]
recurrent MR or perivalvular regurgitation after valve
replacement
variable low
1% per year may require reoperation.
Recurrent MR may occur as a result of progressive degenerative disease, lack of use of an annuloplasty
ring, the use of chordal shortening instead of artificial chordae or transposition, and lack of use of a sliding
plasty for posterior annulus dilation.
prosthesis dysfunction after valve replacement variable low
May be related to surgical procedure, endocarditis, or acute myocardial infarction.
postoperative endocarditis variable low
Both early and late. Usually caused by  Staphylococcus  within days of the operation.

Mitral regurgitation Follow up

Prognosis
There is a 1% per year risk of reoperation after mitral valve repair or replacement. The risk of mortality is
lower with mitral valve repair than with replacement; one study found an overall risk of mortality of <1% for
patients with primary mitral regurgitation (MR) who underwent mitral valve repair.[33]
Patients with chronic severe secondary MR who are treated with transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of
the mitral valve have a lower all-cause mortality at 5 years of follow-up than patients who are treated with
medical therapy alone.[34]
MR may remain asymptomatic for many years. Progression of mitral valve disease is variable and depends
on progression of lesions or mitral annulus size. Severe MR also has a variable prognosis, but most experts
agree that left ventricular dysfunction will occur within 6 to 10 years. For flail posterior mitral leaflet, one
longitudinal study found that at 10 years, 90% of the patients had died or required mitral valve operation.[35]

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
