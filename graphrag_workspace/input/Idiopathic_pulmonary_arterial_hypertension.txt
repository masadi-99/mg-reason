Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Overview
Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a rare, frequently fatal disease.
Presenting symptoms and signs are nonspecific and include dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and a loud
pulmonary component of the second heart sound.
Diagnosis of exclusion. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography and right heart catheterization can diagnose
pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory tests and imaging studies can rule out known causes of pulmonary
hypertension.
Treatment options include calcium-channel blockers, prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists,
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat, the selective prostacyclin
IP receptor agonist selexipag, the activin signaling inhibitor sotatercept, and lung transplantation as
appropriate.
Prognosis is not good, as most patients eventually develop right ventricular failure. It is best managed in
centers with expertise in pulmonary hypertension.
Definition
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries characterized
by vascular proliferation and remodeling. It results in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
(PVR) and, ultimately, right ventricular failure and death.[1] It is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial
pressure >20 mmHg at rest with pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg and PVR >2 Wood units,
without a known cause.[2] [3] [4]

THEORY
Epidemiology
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 48-55 cases per
million adults and an annual incidence of 2.4-6.0 per million people.[4] [5] Several registries have been
established to collect data on baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with PAH, with the first set
up in the 1980s by the US National Institutes of Health.[6] Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH)
is the most common type of PAH reported in the registries, accounting for 30% to 50% of cases.[7] The
age and sex distribution of the disease appears to have evolved over time. The mean age of patients in the
first US registry was 36 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.7:1.[6] Contemporary registries from France
and the US (REVEAL) later described a mean age at diagnosis of 50 years.[8] [9] A significant proportion
of patients (9% in the French registry) were older than 70 years.[8] While the French registry confirmed a
female-to-male ratio of 1.6:1, the US registry depicted a much higher female preponderance, with a female-
to-male ratio of 3.9:1.[8] [9] Another registry of six European countries found that the median age of IPAH
diagnosis was 71 years and that younger patients had a female-to-male ratio of 2.3:1 while the female-
to-male ratio in older adult patients was 1.2:1.[10] In the UK and Ireland, registry data from 2001 to 2009
showed an increase in the average age of IPAH diagnosis, from 45 to 52 years.[11] Comorbidities including
systemic hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease are common in patients
with IPAH.

Etiology
The cause of IPAH is unknown. Its pathogenesis probably involves the interaction of genetic predisposition
and risk factors that cause pulmonary vascular damage.[3] Mutations in the gene encoding bone
morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2), a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-
beta) superfamily, are responsible for familial cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[12] However, only
20% of BMPR2 mutation carriers will develop the disease over a lifetime.[13] BMPR2 mutations have
been also found in 11% to 40% of cases of nonfamilial primary pulmonary hypertension. These mutations
lead to changes in intracellular signaling pathways that result in proliferative and antiapoptotic effects

in the pulmonary vasculature. Other predisposing genetic factors include mutations and variants in the
genes: ACVRL1 (encoding activin receptor-like kinase 1, a type 1 receptor for TGF-beta family proteins);
ENG (encoding endoglin, a glycoprotein); SMAD9 (encoding a SMAD family protein, which transduces
signals from TGF-beta family members); CAV1 (encoding caveolin 1 protein); and KCNK3 gene (encoding
a potassium channel).[14] The exact environmental risk factors in IPAH remain unknown, but possibilities
include infections, drugs such as appetite suppressants, and inflammatory insults.[15] [16] [17]
Pathophysiology
The main vascular changes are vasoconstriction, smooth-muscle cell and endothelial-cell proliferation, and
thrombosis. These changes suggest the predominance of thrombogenic, mitogenic, proinflammatory, and
vasoconstrictive factors, probably as a consequence of pulmonary endothelial-cell dysfunction or injury.[18]
The levels of a prostacyclin metabolite, a potent vasodilator with antiproliferative and antiplatelet activity,
are decreased in the urine of patients with pulmonary hypertension. However, the levels of thromboxane
A2 metabolites (a vasoconstrictor and platelet agonist) are increased.[19] Furthermore, the expression
of prostacyclin synthase is decreased in the pulmonary vascular tree of patients with severe pulmonary
hypertension, particularly IPAH.[20]
Another potent vasoconstrictor and proproliferative mediator is endothelin-1. Its plasma levels are increased
in pulmonary hypertension and correlate with the severity of IPAH.[21] [22] There is also increased
expression of endothelin-1 in vascular endothelial cells in patients with pulmonary hypertension.[23]
The third important mediator in IPAH is nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet
activation and smooth-muscle proliferation.[24] Levels of NO are lower in lungs of patients with IPAH
compared with healthy controls.[25] [26] These low levels were initially thought to be due to decreased
expression of endothelial NO synthase in the lung, but are more likely secondary to increased NO
consumption or decreased NO synthesis due to decreased substrate availability.[27] [28]
Alterations in serotonin, adrenomedullin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, vascular endothelial growth factor,
platelet-derived growth factor, and potassium channels have been described as well.[18] [29] [30]
A procoagulant state and in situ pulmonary vascular thrombosis have been shown in IPAH and are reflected
by elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor
type-1.[31]
These changes cause pulmonary vascular narrowing with a consequent increase in pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR) that leads to right ventricular overload and eventually to right ventricular failure and death.

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Diagnosis
Approach
Because IPAH is a diagnosis of exclusion, there is no definitive diagnostic test, but there are a number of
laboratory and imaging tests that should be used to rule out other types of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The
2022 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines advise a three-
step approach to diagnosis of PH: first suspicion by first-line physicians, then detection by echocardiography,
and finally confirmation in PH centers.[3] If PAH is suspected at any time in the patient evaluation, fast-track
referral to a center with expertise in its diagnosis and management is recommended.[3] [35] [36]
History
Symptoms are nonspecific and mainly related to right heart dysfunction.[3] [36] Early symptoms include
progressive dyspnea on exertion, fatigue and rapid exhaustion, palpitations, chest discomfort, and
lightheadedness. Syncope is a less common but worrisome symptom. Patients may have syncope or near
syncope as cardiac output becomes fixed and eventually falls.[37] Other historic clues are the presence of
pulmonary hypertension in a first-degree relative and prior use of stimulants. There may also be a history
of blood clots or splenectomy. 
Physical exam
Physical exam is often normal in early stages. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Positive signs include
a prominent jugular V wave on the neck, a palpable left parasternal heave, an accentuated pulmonic
component to the second heart sound (P2), and a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the
left sternal border. In more advanced cases, there are signs of right heart failure such as jugular venous
distention, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema.
Tests
Initial tests include a chest x-ray, an ECG, and a transthoracic echocardiogram.[17] [38] Right heart
catheterization is required to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, determine the
type of pulmonary hypertension (precapillary, postcapillary, or combined), and assess pulmonary
hemodynamics and cardiac output to calculate pulmonary vascular resistance.[3] [36] Additional tests are
performed to rule out known causes of pulmonary hypertension. These include antinuclear antibodies,
HIV serology, complete blood count, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, pulmonary function studies,
arterial blood gas, overnight oximetry, and ventilation perfusion scan. Depending on the clinical suspicion,
polysomnography, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and pulmonary angiography could be indicated as well. If the complete
evaluation is unrevealing, the diagnosis of IPAH is made. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal
proBNP (NT-proBNP) levels should be obtained. These are elevated in right ventricular pressure overload
and correlate with severity of right ventricular dysfunction and mortality in IPAH.[3] A 6-minute walk
test should be done as it provides an estimation of exercise capacity and disease severity, as well as
response to therapy and progression.[3]
Vasodilator testing (with inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled iloprost, or intravenous epoprostenol) may help
identify a subset of IPAH patients who might be treated with oral calcium-channel blockers. Testing is not
indicated in unstable patients or those who are in right heart failure.[35]

DIAGNOSIS
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
age 20-50 years (common)
• The age distribution of IPAH has evolved over time. The mean age at diagnosis was 36 years among
patients entered into the US National Institutes of Health registry in the 1980s.[6] Contemporary
registries from France and the US described a mean age at diagnosis of 50 years.[8] [9] A significant
proportion of patients (9% in the French registry) were older than 70 years.[8] Another registry of six
European countries found that the median age of IPAH diagnosis was 71 years.[10] In the UK and
Ireland, registry data from 2001 to 2009 showed an increase in the average age of IPAH diagnosis,
from 45 to 52 years.[11]
female sex (common)
• IPAH is typically more common in females than in males.[6] [7] [8]
dyspnea (common)
• Seen in 60%, particularly with exertion.[6]
accentuated pulmonic component (P2) to the second heart sound (common)
• Due to delayed closure of the pulmonic valve. The physiologic respiratory variation of the second
heart sound is maintained, as opposed to pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with atrial septal
defect.[39] Seen in 93%.[6]
tricuspid regurgitation murmur (common)
• High-pitched, holosystolic, best heard at the left sternal border.[39] Seen in 40%.[6]
family history (uncommon)
• First-degree relative with the disease is seen in 6%.[6]
Other diagnostic factors
fatigue (common)
• Typically presents alongside dyspnea.[37] [39]
peripheral edema (common)
• Seen in 32%.[6]
cyanosis (common)
• Seen in 20%.[6]
stimulant use (uncommon)
• Particularly methamphetamine. Stimulant use was seen in 28.9% in one study.[40]
syncope (uncommon)
• Syncope is a less common but worrisome symptom.[39] Patients may have syncope or near syncope
as cardiac output becomes fixed and eventually falls.[37]

chest pain (uncommon)
• Patients may present with or without chest discomfort.[39]
near syncope (uncommon)
• Patients may have syncope or near syncope as cardiac output becomes fixed and eventually falls.[37]
early diastolic, high-pitched murmur in the pulmonary area (uncommon)
• An early diastolic high-pitched Graham Steell murmur indicative of pulmonic regurgitation.[6] [39]
jugular vein distension (uncommon)
• Prominence of the jugular A or V waves. Hepatojugular reflux may be present as well.[39]
Risk factors
Strong
family history
• The prevalence of familial cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was 6% and 3.9%,
respectively, in the US and French registries.[6] [32] The transmission is autosomal dominant and
shows genetic anticipation, variable expression, and a lifetime penetrance of 10% to 20%.[13] [33] If
one family member has IPAH, the likelihood of a first-degree relative being affected is approximately
0.6% to 1.2%. If there is a second case in the family, the lifetime risk rises to 5% to 10%.[33]
female sex
• Both the early US registry and the French registry showed a female-to-male ratio of 1.7:1 and 1.6:1,
respectively.[6] [8] A more contemporary US registry showed a much higher female preponderance,
with a female-to-male ratio of 3.9:1.[9] Another registry of six European countries found that in younger
patients the female-to-male ratio of IPAH was 2.3:1, while the female-to-male ratio in older adult
patients was almost even, at 1.2:1.[10] Whether there are hormonal or other reasons for sex-specific
differences in PAH is not yet understood.[7] [33]
bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) mutations
• Mutations in the gene encoding for BMPR2, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta
superfamily, cause familial PAH.[12] The exact prevalence of BMPR2 mutations in the IPAH
population is unknown, with reports ranging from 11% to 40%.[13] These mutations lead to changes
in intracellular signaling pathways that result in proliferative and antiapoptotic effects in the pulmonary
vasculature.[13]
appetite suppressants
• Appetite suppressants, especially aminorex, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and benfluorex, are
definite risk factors.[3] [34]

drugs and toxins
• In addition to appetite suppressants, various other classes of drugs have been associated with the
development of PAH. These include amphetamine-like agents (methamphetamine, amphetamine),
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, bosutinib, ruxolitinib, nintedanib, imatinib), antiviral medications
(sofosbuvir, simeprevir, daclatasvir), alkylating agents (busulfan, cyclophosphamide, carboplatin,
melphalan), immunosuppressive agents (abatacept, leflunomide, thalidomide, mycophenolic acid,
everolimus, cyclosporine), antineoplastic agents (docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, trastuzumab,
vinblastine, vincristine), antimetabolites (gemcitabine), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib),
interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab), programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 inhibitors
(nivolumab), stimulants (modafinil), and interferons (alfa-2b, beta-a, pegylated alfa-2a, pegylated
alfa-2b).[3] [34]

the basis of Doppler-acquired tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet velocity
plus estimated right atrial pressure from inferior vena cava (IVC)
assessment. IVC-based estimation of right atrial pressure is prone
to inaccuracy and can lead to amplification of measurement errors
when calculating sPAP.[42] Correlation with right heart catheterization
measurements is variable (r from 0.57 to 0.93), and is more robust

for sPAP >50 mmHg and <100 mmHg.[39] Sensitivity and specificity
of the estimated sPAP in predicting pulmonary arterial hypertension
ranges from 79% to 100%, and 60% to 98%.[43] TR velocity (TRV)
should be used for screening for PH; a peak TRV of >2.8 m/s is
suggestive of PH. TRV should be used with other transthoracic
echocardiographic measures of RV function including the tricuspid
annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV fractional area change
(RV-FAC), RV free-wall strain, and tricuspid annulus velocity (S
′ wave) derived from tissue Doppler imaging, and potentially RV
ejection fraction (RVEF) derived from 3D echocardiography.[3]
 The TAPSE/sPAP ratio measures RV arterial coupling and may
also aid diagnosis.[3] [44] The pattern of RV outflow tract (RVOT)
blood flow (mid-systolic "notching") may suggest precapillary PH.[3]
Echocardiography is a good screening test to detect pulmonary
hypertension, but it always requires confirmation with right heart
catheterization. Should be repeated if required.

DIAGNOSIS
The European Society of Cardiology(ESC)/European Respiratory Society(ERS) guidelines highlight a
combination of clinical, functional, and hemodynamic measures as a tool to stratify risk of mortality at 1
year.[3]
The ESC/ERS guidelines recommend a three-strata model for risk assessment at the time of diagnosis,
using categories of low, intermediate, and high risk of mortality at 1 year. This is used to assess survival and
guide management.[3] [54]
Comprehensive risk assessment in pulmonary arterial hypertension (three-strata model). 6MWD, 6-minute

Screening
Screening is indicated in patients with known genetic mutations predisposing to pulmonary hypertension,
specifically the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) mutation, and in first-degree relatives
of patients with heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).[3] Doppler echo to detect elevated
pulmonary artery pressure is the test of choice. Screening for PAH is also indicated in patients with
the scleroderma spectrum of disease, and in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing evaluation for liver
transplantation. However, given the low prevalence of PAH, screening runs the risk of false-positives, and
thus results must be carefully evaluated, ideally at expert centers.

MANAGEMENT
Approach
Treatment goals include the following: improvement to WHO functional class I or II, improvement in the 6-
minute walk distance (6MWD) to 380-440 meters, normal or near normal right ventricular (RV) size and
function on echocardiography, a peak oxygen uptake of >15 mL/kg/minute during cardiopulmonary exercise
testing, normal B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and normalization of RV function as assessed by
hemodynamics obtained by right heart catheterization (right atrial pressure <8 mmHg and cardiac index >2.5
L/minute/m²).[56]
Due to the complexities that these patients pose, it is strongly recommended that they are referred to a
center with expertise in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Treatment options available
include general supportive therapy, pulmonary artery hypertension-specific therapy (calcium-channel
blockers, prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 [PDE5] inhibitors, a selective
prostacyclin IP receptor agonist [selexipag], a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator [riociguat], or an activin
signaling inhibitor [sotatercept]), and lung transplantation as appropriate.[3] [35][57]
Supportive therapy
General supportive therapy is indicated for most patients.[3] [35] [57]
• Supervised exercise training: recommended for those on PAH medical therapy who are in a
stable clinical condition.[3] [58] [59] [60]  Heavy physical exertion and isometric exercise should
be avoided.[61] There is a lack of evidence for a direct impact of exercise training on survival and
outcome in pulmonary hypertension. However, there are studies showing a beneficial effect on
prognostically important parameters. The European Respiratory Society has identified a strong
need to establish specialized rehabilitation programs for patients with PAH to enhance access to
this treatment intervention, which appears to be effective, cost-efficient and safe.[59]
• Psychosocial support: should be considered, including advanced care planning with referral to
specialist palliative care services at the right time.[3]
• Vaccinations: patients should be offered influenza,  Streptococcus pneumoniae , and coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations at a minimum.[3]
• Diuretics: recommended in patients with fluid retention and signs of right ventricular failure.[3] [62]
[63]
• Supplemental oxygen: given in hypoxemia.[4]
• Supplemental iron: correction of iron status in case of iron deficiency.[3]
• Anticoagulation: not generally recommended in patients with PAH but should be considered on a
case-by-case basis.[3]
• Pregnancy: patients with IPAH should avoid pregnancy, and women of childbearing age should be
counseled about the risks associated with becoming pregnant.[3] [35] Those who present during
pregnancy, or who become pregnant, should be treated by a multidisciplinary team experienced in
managing pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy. Some of the drugs used to treat IPAH may cause
fetal harm and may not be recommended in pregnancy; consult your local drug information source
for more information.
Acute vasoreactivity testing
In some patients, vasoconstriction largely predominates over vascular remodeling phenomena. In this
situation, calcium channel blockers can provide real clinical benefit.[4] These patients are identified by
acute vasoreactivity testing (with inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled iloprost, or intravenous epoprostenol), which

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Management
should generally be performed in all IPAH patients. Patients who are responsive should be treated with
optimally tolerated doses of calcium-channel blockers. It is estimated that <10% of patients with IPAH
are responders.[64] Vasoreactivity testing is contraindicated in patients with WHO functional class IV
symptoms and low cardiac index. Vasoreactivity testing is generally not recommended for pulmonary
hypertension that is caused by underlying diseases.
Positive response:
• A positive response is defined as a fall in mean pulmonary artery pressure by ≥10 mmHg to reach
an absolute value ≤40 mmHg, with an increased or unchanged cardiac output.[3] [61] About 12%
of IPAH patients may have a positive response and should be started on calcium-channel blocker
therapy.[3] [47]
• A satisfactory response to calcium-channel blocker therapy is defined as being in WHO functional
class I or II with near-normal hemodynamics after several months of therapy.[3] [47] Close
monitoring is mandatory, and patients should have a full reassessment at 3-6 months.[3]
• Patients with a sustained satisfactory response should continue calcium-channel blocker therapy,
with further reassessment every 6-12 months.[3]
• Patients without a sustained satisfactory response require additional therapy and should be
treated the same as those with a negative response to acute vasoreactivity testing. Continuation
of calcium-channel blocker (combined with additional therapy) may need to be considered in some
patients because of clinical deterioration with calcium-channel blocker withdrawal attempts.[3]
• Calcium-channel blockers predominantly used in PAH are nifedipine, diltiazem, felodipine, and
amlodipine.[3] Choice of drug is based on baseline heart rate (HR): if HR <100 beats/minute -
nifedipine, felodipine, amlodipine; if HR >100 beats/minute - diltiazem.
Nonresponders to vasoreactivity testing and patients without sustained response to calcium-channel
blockers, or those in whom calcium-channel blockers are contraindicated, should be started on another
PAH-specific therapy. All currently approved drugs target the vasoconstriction-vasodilation balance of
endothelial dysfunction and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation observed in PAH.[4] Targeted
treatment options include the following.
• Prostanoids: prostanoids have been shown to improve the distance walked in 6 minutes, functional
class, and hemodynamics, and to avoid clinical worsening.[3] [65]  Epoprostenol is administered
via continuous intravenous infusion (requiring an infusion pump and a permanent central
venous catheter, with associated risks of central venous catheter bloodstream infections). In
one prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, continuous intravenous infusion of epoprostenol
improved symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival in patients with severe IPAH.[66] Other
prostanoids include treprostinil, which can be administered subcutaneously or intravenously.
 Subcutaneous administration of treprostinil avoids the risks associated with chronic indwelling
central venous catheters, and in one double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial was shown to
improve exercise capacity, symptoms, and hemodynamics in patients with PAH.[67]
• Endothelin receptor antagonists: endothelin-1 binds to endothelin A and B receptors and is a
potent vasoconstrictor and smooth-muscle mitogen whose system is activated in IPAH.[3] One
Cochrane review found that for people with WHO functional class II and III PAH, endothelin
receptor antagonists probably increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class, prevent
WHO functional class deterioration, and improve hemodynamics.[68]  Bosentan, an oral antagonist
of both endothelin A and B receptors, has shown improvements in the 6MWD, functional class,
hemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening. Liver function tests should be checked every
month and hematocrit every 3 months. Bosentan is teratogenic in animals and may lessen the

effectiveness of hormonal contraception. It may cause testicular atrophy and male infertility.[61]
Ambrisentan, a selective endothelin A receptor antagonist, improves exercise capacity, symptoms,
and hemodynamics and carries a low risk of liver toxicity.[69] [70] Macitentan is a novel dual
endothelin receptor antagonist found to delay a composite endpoint of morbidity and mortality
(driven by worsening PAH symptoms) in one long-term event-driven placebo-controlled clinical
trial.[71]
• PDE5 inhibitors: these agents augment the pulmonary vascular response to nitric oxide (NO).[72]
 Tadalafil has been shown to improve the 6MWD and to be associated with less clinical worsening
and improved quality of life.[73]  Sildenafil has been shown to improve exercise capacity, functional
class, and hemodynamics in patients with PAH, and may reduce clinical worsening.[74] [75]
• Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators: also augment the NO pathway, but they do so by directly
stimulating the enzyme that synthesizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), the second
messenger and downstream effector of NO. Riociguat, the only drug available in this class to
date, improved 6MWD, pulmonary vascular resistance, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide,
WHO functional class, and time to clinical worsening in one 12-week, double-blind, multicenter
randomized trial.[76]
• Selective prostacyclin IP receptor agonists: selexipag, the only drug available in this class, reduced
the risk of a composite of death or complications related to PAH in both pretreated patients and
patients naive to therapy. Lower rates of disease progression and hospitalization accounted for the
majority of the risk reduction.[77]
• Activin signaling inhibitor: sotatercept is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the extracellular
domain of the human activin receptor type IIA linked to the FC domain of human IgG1, which acts
as a ligand trap by binding activins and GDFs, thus restoring the balance between proproliferative
and antiproliferative bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways.[78] Sotatercept is approved in
the US for the treatment of adults with PAH to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional
class, and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. It is also approved in Europe for this
indication. In one phase 2 trial, treatment with sotatercept resulted in a reduction in pulmonary
vascular resistance in patients receiving background therapy for PAH, compared with placebo.[79]
In the multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 STELLAR trial, in patients with PAH (WHO functional class
II or III) on stable background therapy, adding sotatercept significantly improved exercise capacity
(as assessed by the 6-minute walk test), compared with placebo.[80]
Risk stratification as a basis for treatment decisions
For treatment decisions, a rational approach should be used to classify patients into risk groups based on
the combination of several clinical features, including hemodynamics, WHO functional class, 6MWD, and
BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP).[3] [57] In general, the goal of therapy is to shift patients to, or
maintain patients in, a low-risk category. Significant clinical judgment and experience is needed to make
these decisions.
For patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European
Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines recommend a three-strata model for risk assessment at the time of
diagnosis, using categories of low, intermediate, and high risk of mortality at 1 year to assess survival and
guide management.[3] [54]

Patients initially assessed as at low or intermediate risk of mortality who are unresponsive to acute
vasoreactivity testing, or who cannot take calcium-channel blockers, should preferably be started on
combination therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist plus a PDE5 inhibitor.[3] ESC/ERS guidelines
recommend initial oral combination therapy with tadalafil plus either ambrisentan or macitentan.[3]
Combinations of other endothelin receptor antagonists and PDE5 inhibitors may also be considered.
One multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study showed a lower risk of clinical failure with
upfront combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil compared with each monotherapy alone.[81]
 In this study, upfront combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil delayed clinical worsening
in PAH, particularly hospitalizations. Another multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase 3b study
demonstrated substantial improvements in hemodynamics and exercise capacity with initial combination
therapy (macitentan and tadalafil) and that there was no benefit of triple therapy (macitentan, tadalafil,
and selexipag) compared with the double therapy.[82]

MANAGEMENT
Patients initially assessed as being at high risk of mortality who are unresponsive to acute vasoreactivity
testing, or who cannot take calcium-channel blockers, should be considered for combination therapy
with an endothelin receptor antagonist plus a PDE5 inhibitor plus a parenteral prostanoid (intravenous
epoprostenol or intravenous/subcutaneous treprostinil).[3] Upfront triple therapy is associated with clinical
and hemodynamic improvement and reduces right ventricular remodeling.[83] [84] [85]
During monitoring and follow-up after initial therapy (every 3-6 months according to patient needs), the
ESC/ERS guidelines recommend using a four-strata model, which uses categories of low, intermediate-
low, intermediate-high, and high risk to guide treatment decisions.[3]
Variables used to calculate the simplified four-strata risk-assessment tool
European Heart Journal. 2022 Oct 7;43(38):3618-731; used with permission
Patients assessed to be at low risk should continue their initial therapy.[3] Switching from intravenous or
subcutaneous therapy to oral therapy in patients who achieve a low risk status can be considered on a
case-by-case basis.
Addition of selexipag to the initial combination of an endothelin receptor antagonist plus a PDE5 inhibitor
should be considered for patients assessed to be at intermediate-low risk. Alternatively, switching from the
PDE5 inhibitor to riociguat may also be considered.[86] A PDE5 inhibitor and riociguat should not be used
in combination, because this leads to a higher risk of systemic hypotension.[87] 
Addition of a prostanoid should be considered for patients assessed to be at intermediate-high or high risk
while on an initial combination of an endothelin receptor antagonist plus a PDE5 inhibitor.[87] Referral for
lung transplantation evaluation should also be considered.

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Management
Patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities
Evidence for treatment of patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities is lacking. The ESC/ERS
guidelines recommend that initial monotherapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist or a PDE5 inhibitor
may be considered, with additional treatment options considered on an individual basis for those at
intermediate or high risk of death at follow-up.[3]
Treatment-resistant patients
Patients refractory to all medical therapy should be evaluated for lung transplantation.[3]
The availability of effective medical therapy has reduced the need for lung transplantation. However,
transplantation remains an important option for patients in whom medical therapy has failed and
who remain in WHO functional class III or IV. Referral for lung transplant evaluation is recommended
when patients present with an inadequate response to optimized combination therapy and have an
intermediate-high or high risk of death.[3] Double lung transplantation is most commonly performed.
Heart-lung transplantation should be considered in patients with additional cardiac conditions.[3] When to
list a patient for lung transplantation is a difficult decision, further complicated by the unpredictable waiting
list and the shortage of donor organs.[3]
Balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) produces right-to-left shunting that decompresses the right atrium and
right ventricle, increases systemic cardiac output, and decreases systemic arterial oxygen saturation.
The latter is offset by the increase in output leading to an increase in systemic oxygen transport.[3] BAS
is used as a palliative option or bridge to lung transplantation in patients who are deteriorating despite
maximal medical therapy; as it is a complex and high-risk procedure it is rarely performed and only
considered in experienced centers.[3] [57]

<10% of patients with IPAH are responders.[64]
 Vasoreactivity testing is contraindicated in
patients with WHO functional class IV symptoms
and low cardiac index. Vasoreactivity testing
is generally not recommended for pulmonary
hypertension that is caused by underlying
diseases.
» A positive response is defined as a fall in
mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of
≥10 mmHg to reach an absolute value of ≤40

[61] About 12% of patients are responsive,
and they should be started on calcium-channel
blocker therapy.[3] [47]
» Calcium-channel blockers predominantly used
in pulmonary arterial hypertension are nifedipine,
diltiazem, felodipine, and amlodipine.[3] Choice
of drug can be based on baseline heart rate
(HR): if HR <100 beats/minute - nifedipine,
felodipine, or amlodipine; if HR >100 beats/
minute - diltiazem.
» A satisfactory response to a calcium-channel
blocker is defined as being in functional class
I or II with near-normal hemodynamics after
several months of therapy.[3] [47] Close
monitoring is mandatory, and patients should
have a full reassessment at 3-6 months.[3]
» Patients with a sustained satisfactory
response should continue calcium-channel
blocker therapy, with reassessment every 6-12
months.[3]
» Patients without a sustained satisfactory
response require additional therapy and should
be treated the same as those with a negative
response to acute vasoreactivity testing (see
below). Continuation of calcium-channel
blocker (combined with additional therapy)
may need to be considered in some patients
because of clinical deterioration with calcium-
channel blocker withdrawal attempts; consult a
specialist.[3]
plus supportive measures
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» General supportive therapy is indicated for
most patients.[3][35] [57]
» Supervised exercise training is recommended
for those on pulmonary arterial hypertension
medical therapy who are in a stable clinical
condition.[3] [58] [59] [60]  Heavy physical
exertion and isometric exercise should be
avoided.[61] There is a lack of evidence for a
direct impact of exercise training on survival
and outcome in pulmonary hypertension.
However, there are studies showing a beneficial
effect on prognostically important parameters.
The European Respiratory Society has
identified a strong need to establish specialized
rehabilitation programs for patients with PAH to
enhance access to this treatment intervention,
which appears to be effective, cost-efficient and
safe.[59]

» Patients with IPAH should avoid pregnancy,
and women of childbearing age should be
counseled about the risks associated with
becoming pregnant.[3] [35] Those who present
during pregnancy, or who become pregnant,
should be treated by a multidisciplinary
team experienced in managing pulmonary

is unknown.
» Serum electrolytes and renal function should
be closely monitored.[3] [62] Excessive diuresis

saturation of <92% at rest, during sleep, or with
ambulation. Hypoxemia is a potent pulmonary
vasoconstrictor and can contribute to the
development and/or progression of pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH).
» The goal of therapy is to keep oxygen
saturation >92% at all times.[61] However, no
consistent data are available on the effects of
long-term oxygen treatment in PAH.[3] Thus,
this recommendation is based on expert opinion
and extrapolated from data in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.
adjunct anticoagulation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with IPAH have in situ microscopic
thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature and
prothrombotic abnormalities, and if in right
ventricular failure, they are at increased risk
for venous thromboembolism.[62] However,
randomized controlled trial data on use of
anticoagulation in patients with IPAH are lacking.
Improved survival with anticoagulants has
been reported in retrospective single-center
studies, one small prospective noncontrolled
nonrandomized study, and one observational
registry.[63] [88] On the other hand, data from
the REVEAL registry did not show a survival
benefit from anticoagulation in IPAH patients.[89]
 Therefore, anticoagulation is not generally
recommended in patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension but should be considered on a
case-by-case basis.[3] Consult a specialist
for guidance on the choice of anticoagulant
regimen.
adjunct iron supplementation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» European guidelines recommend correction
of iron status in patients with pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH) and iron
deficiency anemia.[3] Randomized controlled
trials comparing oral and intravenous iron
supplementation in patients with PAH are
lacking. European guidelines recommend
intravenous supplementation for patients with
severe iron deficiency anemia (defined as
hemoglobin <7-8 g/dL).[3] See Iron deficiency

» Endothelin receptor antagonists: ambrisentan
has been shown to improve exercise capacity,
symptoms, and hemodynamics and carries a low
risk of liver toxicity.[69] [70] Macitentan, a novel
dual endothelin receptor antagonist, was found
to delay a composite endpoint of morbidity and
mortality (driven by worsening PAH symptoms)
in a long-term event-driven placebo-controlled
clinical trial.[71] Common adverse effects include
anemia, nasal congestion, and headache.
Anemia can occasionally be severe. Bosentan
acts as an antagonist of both endothelin-A
and endothelin-B receptors, and has shown
improvement in the 6-minute walk distance
(6MWD), functional class, hemodynamics, and
time to clinical worsening. Liver function tests
should be checked every month and hematocrit
every 3 months. Bosentan is teratogenic in
animals and may lessen the effectiveness of
hormonal contraception. It may cause testicular
atrophy and male infertility.[61]
» PDE5 inhibitors: augment the pulmonary
vascular response to nitric oxide.[72] Tadalafil
has been shown to improve the 6MWD and
to be associated with less clinical worsening
and improved quality of life.[73]  Sildenafil
improves exercise capacity, functional class,
and hemodynamics and may reduce clinical
worsening.[74] [75] There appears to be no
dose-response relationship between higher
doses of sildenafil and exercise capacity.[61]
» European guidelines recommend initial oral
combination therapy with tadalafil plus either
ambrisentan or macitentan.[3] Combinations of
other endothelin receptor antagonists and PDE5
inhibitors may also be considered. Proprietary
combination fixed-dose formulations may be
available in some countries (e.g., macitentan/
tadalafil).
» The European guidelines state that patients
at intermediate risk presenting with severe
hemodynamic impairment should be considered
for initial triple therapy including a prostanoid

» Sotatercept, an activin signaling inhibitor, is
approved in the US and Europe for the treatment
of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension
to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO
functional class, and reduce the risk of clinical
worsening events. Addition of sotatercept
to background therapy can be considered;
however, guidelines do not yet recommend its
use and there is no clear guidance on which
patients should receive it.
» In one phase 2 trial, treatment with sotatercept
resulted in a reduction in pulmonary vascular
resistance in patients receiving background
therapy for PAH, compared with placebo.[79] In
the multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 STELLAR
trial, in patients with PAH (WHO functional class
II or III) on stable background therapy, adding
sotatercept significantly improved exercise
capacity (as assessed by the 6-minute walk

» Patients with IPAH should avoid pregnancy,
and women of childbearing age should be
counseled about the risks associated with
becoming pregnant.[3] [35] Those who present
during pregnancy, or who become pregnant,
should be treated by a multidisciplinary
team experienced in managing pulmonary
hypertension in pregnancy. Some of the drugs
used to treat IPAH may cause fetal harm and
may not be recommended in pregnancy; consult
your local drug information source for more
information.
adjunct sotatercept
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» sotatercept: 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously
every 3 weeks initially, increase to target dose
of 0.7 mg/kg every 3 weeks according to
response
Assess hemoglobin and platelet counts
before each dose for the first 5 doses (or
longer if values are unstable), and monitor
periodically thereafter. Dose modifications
may be necessary; consult prescribing
information for more information. Do not
initiate therapy if platelet count <50,000/mm³.
» Sotatercept, an activin signaling inhibitor, is
approved in the US and Europe for the treatment
of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension
to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO
functional class, and reduce the risk of clinical
worsening events. Addition of sotatercept
to background therapy can be considered;
however, guidelines do not yet recommend its
use and there is no clear guidance on which
patients should receive it.
» In one phase 2 trial, treatment with sotatercept
resulted in a reduction in pulmonary vascular
resistance in patients receiving background
therapy for PAH, compared with placebo.[79] In
the multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 STELLAR
trial, in patients with PAH (WHO functional class
II or III) on stable background therapy, adding
sotatercept significantly improved exercise
capacity (as assessed by the 6-minute walk
test), compared with placebo.[80]

Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Supplemental oxygen should be given
in cases of hypoxemia, defined as arterial
oxygen tension of <60 mmHg or oxygen
saturation of <92% at rest, during sleep, or with
ambulation. Hypoxemia is a potent pulmonary
vasoconstrictor and can contribute to the
development and/or progression of pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH).
» The goal of therapy is to keep oxygen

disease 2019 (COVID-19) at a minimum.[3]
» Patients with IPAH should avoid pregnancy,
and women of childbearing age should be
counseled about the risks associated with
becoming pregnant.[3] [35] Those who present
during pregnancy, or who become pregnant,
should be treated by a multidisciplinary
team experienced in managing pulmonary
hypertension in pregnancy. Some of the drugs
used to treat IPAH may cause fetal harm and
may not be recommended in pregnancy; consult
your local drug information source for more
information.
adjunct sotatercept
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» sotatercept: 0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously
every 3 weeks initially, increase to target dose
of 0.7 mg/kg every 3 weeks according to
response
Assess hemoglobin and platelet counts
before each dose for the first 5 doses (or
longer if values are unstable), and monitor
periodically thereafter. Dose modifications
may be necessary; consult prescribing
information for more information. Do not
initiate therapy if platelet count <50,000/mm³.
» Sotatercept, an activin signaling inhibitor, is
approved in the US and Europe for the treatment
of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension
to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO
functional class, and reduce the risk of clinical
worsening events. Addition of sotatercept
to background therapy can be considered;
however, guidelines do not yet recommend its
use and there is no clear guidance on which
patients should receive it.

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Management
Ongoing
» In one phase 2 trial, treatment with sotatercept
resulted in a reduction in pulmonary vascular
resistance in patients receiving background
therapy for PAH, compared with placebo.[79] In
the multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 STELLAR
trial, in patients with PAH (WHO functional class
II or III) on stable background therapy, adding
sotatercept significantly improved exercise
capacity (as assessed by the 6-minute walk
test), compared with placebo.[80]
» Sotatercept may cause serious bleeding (more
likely with concomitant prostacyclin therapy and/
or antithrombotic agents), erythrocytosis, and
severe thrombocytopenia.
adjunct diuretic
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» furosemide: 20-80 mg orally initially, may
repeat dose or increase by 20-40 mg every
6-8 hours according to response, usual
dose 40-120 mg/day given in 1-2 divided
doses, maximum 600 mg/day; 20-40 mg
intravenously/intramuscularly initially, may
repeat dose or increase by 20 mg every 2
hours according to response
» A diuretic (e.g., furosemide) is recommended
in patients with fluid retention and signs of right
ventricular failure.[3] [62] [63] Effect on mortality
is unknown.
» Serum electrolytes and renal function should
be closely monitored.[3] [62] Excessive diuresis
may lead to systemic hypotension, renal
insufficiency, and syncope.
» There are no trials with specific classes
of diuretics, and thus the choice should be
individualized according to local protocols.[3]
adjunct supplemental oxygen
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Supplemental oxygen should be given
in cases of hypoxemia, defined as arterial
oxygen tension of <60 mmHg or oxygen
saturation of <92% at rest, during sleep, or with
ambulation. Hypoxemia is a potent pulmonary
vasoconstrictor and can contribute to the
development and/or progression of pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH).

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
Ongoing
» The goal of therapy is to keep oxygen
saturation >92% at all times.[61] However, no
consistent data are available on the effects of
long-term oxygen treatment in PAH.[3] Thus,
this recommendation is based on expert opinion
and extrapolated from data in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.
adjunct anticoagulation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with IPAH have in situ microscopic
thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature and
prothrombotic abnormalities, and if in right
ventricular failure, they are at increased risk
for venous thromboembolism.[62] However,
randomized controlled trial data on use of
anticoagulation in patients with IPAH are lacking.
Improved survival with anticoagulants has
been reported in retrospective single-center
studies, one small prospective noncontrolled
nonrandomized study, and one observational
registry.[63] [88] On the other hand, data from
the REVEAL registry did not show a survival
benefit from anticoagulation in IPAH patients.[89]
 Therefore, anticoagulation is not generally
recommended in patients with pulmonary arterial
hypertension but should be considered on a
case-by-case basis.[3] Consult a specialist
for guidance on the choice of anticoagulant
regimen.
adjunct iron supplementation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» European guidelines recommend correction
of iron status in patients with pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH) and iron
deficiency anemia.[3] Randomized controlled
trials comparing oral and intravenous iron
supplementation in patients with PAH are
lacking. European guidelines recommend
intravenous supplementation for patients with
severe iron deficiency anemia (defined as
hemoglobin <7-8 g/dL).[3] See Iron deficiency
anemia .

Emerging
Imatinib
Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat some types of cancer. It was investigated in a phase
3 clinical trial for the treatment of PAH; it was found to improve exercise capacity and hemodynamics
in patients with advanced PAH, but resulted in substantial adverse events, and discontinuations were
common.[90] An inhaled formulation of imatinib has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA, and
trials are ongoing.
Tacrolimus
Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor and immunosuppressant drug in clinical use for the prevention of organ
rejection in transplant recipients. In animal models, low-dose tacrolimus activates bone morphogenetic
protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2), rescues endothelial dysfunction, and reverses pulmonary hypertension.[91]
Low-dose tacrolimus was given to three patients with end-stage PAH on a compassionate basis and led
to significant improvements in functional capacity, serologic markers, and BMPR2 markers of activity, and
decreased hospitalizations.[92] A phase 2a trial showed that low-dose tacrolimus is well tolerated and
increases BMPR2 in subsets of PAH patients.[93] A phase 2b efficacy trial is planned. 
Patient discussions
Low-level graded aerobic exercise (e.g., walking) should be encouraged, and supervised exercise training
is recommended.[3][35] [57] [59][60]  There is a lack of evidence for a direct impact of exercise training on
survival and outcome in pulmonary hypertension. However, there are studies showing a beneficial effect
on prognostically important parameters. The European Respiratory Society has identified a strong need
to establish specialized rehabilitation programs for patients with PAH to enhance access to this treatment
intervention, which appears to be effective, cost-efficient and safe.[59] Patients should avoid heavy
physical activity, isotonic exercises, and high altitudes. Some patients may require oxygen on commercial
aircraft; European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines recommend in-flight
oxygen administration for patients using oxygen or whose arterial blood oxygen pressure is <8 kPa (60
mmHg) at sea level.[3]
Patients should follow a sodium-restricted diet.[106] Electrolytes should be monitored in patients receiving
diuretics, particularly at the onset of therapy and after changes in dosing.
Recommended immunizations against influenza, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and
pneumococcal pneumonia should be given.
Patients should avoid vasoconstricting sinus or common cold preparations and anorexigens.
Pregnancy should be avoided, and women of childbearing age should be counseled about the risks
associated with becoming pregnant.[3] [35] Those who present during pregnancy, or who become
pregnant, should be treated by a multidisciplinary team experienced in managing pulmonary hypertension
in pregnancy.
The risk-benefit ratio of elective surgery needs to be carefully considered.[107]
Patients may need psychosocial support, including advanced care planning with referral to specialist
palliative care services at the right time.[3]

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients being treated for IPAH should be monitored closely, with regular re-evaluations (depending on
clinical stability and patient needs) to assess treatment goals.
Medical assessment including WHO functional classification, 6-minute walk test, blood tests including
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), and ECG should be done at every
follow-up visit.[3] Use of Doppler echocardiography should be individualized. Practice varies widely with
regards to repeat invasive hemodynamic measurements. As parameters such as cardiac index and
mixed venous oxygen saturation are highly associated with prognosis after the onset of therapy, follow-
up right heart catheterization should be strongly considered for most patients, depending on the clinical
circumstances.[103] If treatment goals are not met, changes to medical therapy or evaluation for lung
transplantation should be considered.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
right ventricular failure long term high
Pulmonary vascular narrowing causes a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, which
leads to right ventricular overload and eventually to right ventricular failure and death.[3] Treatment
includes diuretics, digoxin, oxygen supplementation, oral pulmonary vasodilator therapy, and parenteral
therapies.[3]
supraventricular tachyarrhythmias long term medium
Seen in 11% of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension in association with right ventricular
failure.[104] They are probably related to structural changes and enlargement of the right ventricle and the
right atrium secondary to chronic pressure overload.
Treatment options include digoxin, electrical cardioversion, overdrive pacing, and radiofrequency ablation.
treatment-related headache variable high
Prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors cause headache as an
adverse effect.
central venous catheter-related infections variable high
Patients receiving prostanoids via a central venous catheter are prone to bloodstream infections, which
must be recognized and treated promptly. Detailed guidelines for the prevention of catheter-related
complications in these patients have been published.[105]
Prognosis
Estimated median survival in IPAH, without specific therapies, is 2.8 years, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year
survival rates of 68%, 48%, and 34%, respectively.[94]

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Impact of therapy on survival
Epoprostenol therapy improves survival in IPAH.[66] In one large series, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and
5-year survival rates were 88%, 76%, 63%, 56%, and 47%, respectively, compared with 1-year, 2-year, and
3-year predicted survival rates (based on the National Institutes of Health [NIH] Registry equation) of 59%,
46%, and 35%, respectively.[95] Less robust data suggest that warfarin and oral calcium-channel blockers
(in acute vasoreactive patients) also prolong survival.[96] Meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled randomized
trials showed that pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-targeted therapies reduce all-cause mortality.[97]
[98] In addition, observational registry data confirmed an improvement in survival in IPAH, with 1-year, 3-year,
and 5-year survival rates of 91%, 74%, and 65%, respectively.[99]
Baseline prognostic factors
The following are associated with worse prognosis: syncope; male sex; older age; renal insufficiency; New
York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV; short 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) (variable cutoffs
in different studies, approximately <300 to 440 meters); echocardiography showing pericardial effusion and/
or tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <1.5 cm; elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (>180
picograms/mL); and invasive hemodynamics showing right atrial pressure >15 mmHg and/or cardiac index
≤2 L/minute/m².[100] [101]
Prognostic factors after therapy
The following are associated with worse prognosis: NYHA classes III and IV; 6MWD <380 meters; elevated
BNP levels; low cardiac index; and high right atrial pressure. It is debatable whether absolute values or
changes in these parameters compared with baseline are predictors of outcome. Emerging evidence
suggests that the change in 6MWD is not predictive of clinical events.[102] One study demonstrated that
changes in NYHA functional class, cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and N-terminal pro-BNP
(NT-proBNP) were predictive of transplant-free survival. Specifically, the achievement with therapy of NYHA
classes I or II, a cardiac index ≥ 2.5 L/minute/m², or a mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥65% was associated
with improved survival.[103]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
