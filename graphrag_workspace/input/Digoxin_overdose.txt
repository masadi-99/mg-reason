Digoxin overdose Overview
Summary
Digoxin overdose can be acute or chronic, intentional, or accidental.
Typically presents with components of gastrointestinal, constitutional, and/or cardiovascular symptoms.
Diagnosis is based on symptoms and laboratory data. At therapeutic digoxin doses (0.5 to 0.9 nanograms/
mL), the ECG typically shows PR-interval prolongation and a scooped ST segment. In overdose, ECG also
shows signs of increased automaticity (premature ventricular contractions), atrioventricular nodal blockade,
and slowed ventricular response.
Treatment includes digoxin-specific antibody fragments and supportive care. Lidocaine and phenytoin can be
used for cardiac dysrhythmias when antibody fragments are unavailable.
There are no long-term complications of poisoning in patients treated appropriately for chronic digoxin
toxicity, as long as anoxic brain injury, myocardial infarction, or terminal dysrhythmias have not occurred prior
to treatment.
Definition
Digoxin is the most commonly prescribed cardioactive corticosteroid in the US. It is indicated for the
treatment of mild to moderate heart failure.[1] In therapeutic doses, digoxin increases cardiac contractility
and controls the heart rate.
Digoxin toxicity is a clinical diagnosis that relies in part on ECG findings such as signs of increased
automaticity and atrioventricular node blockade (premature ventricular contractions, slowed ventricular
response). Serum digoxin concentration is usually greater than the therapeutic range of 0.5 to 0.9
nanograms/mL, but may not be elevated. In addition to pharmaceuticals, toxicity can also occur from
exposure to a number of plants and animals that contain cardioactive corticosteroids, including dogbane,
foxglove, lily of the valley, oleander, yellow oleander, red quill, and the  Bufo  species toad. Although these
other toxins are clinically similar, this topic specifically discusses toxicity from digoxin.

Digoxin overdose Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Digoxin usage is decreasing due to its inferiority to other heart failure medications and digoxin toxicity has,
therefore, become less common; but it is at risk of being overlooked.[2]
Using 2005–2010 reports from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, an estimated 5156
emergency department visits for digoxin toxicity occurred annually in the US, of which >75% resulted in
hospital admissions.[3] Digoxin toxicity accounted for approximately 1.0% of all emergency department visits
for all adverse drug events among patients aged ≥40 years; this figure was estimated to be 3.3% for patients
aged ≥85 years.[3]
In 2022, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported 266 fatalities following exposure
to cardiovascular drugs; digoxin was the first ranked pharmaceutical in 21 of these deaths.[4] Patients
aged >55 years are more commonly affected, but toxicity occurs in both young and old people.[5] [6] Drug-
drug interactions involving digoxin are a common cause of adverse drug effects in older people.[7] Rate of
emergency department visits and hospitalization for digoxin toxicity appear to be greater for women than
men.[3] [8]
Young children are mainly at risk of unintentional medication overdose; adults are mainly at risk from
intentional ingestions in a suicide attempt. Dosing errors, increased bioavailability, and decreased clearance
may also result in overdose.
Etiology
Digoxin toxicity can occur through a number of different mechanisms:
Acute
• Overdose after suicide attempt
• Medication dosing error
• Malicious intent (homicidal poisoning).
Chronic
• Chronic digoxin overmedication
• Increased gastrointestinal absorption (caused by antibacterial therapy, or by drug-induced P-
glycoprotein inhibition)[9] [10] [11]
• Decreased renal clearance due to renal insufficiency or drugs[12] [13] [14] [15] [16]
• Displacement of digoxin from protein-binding sites[12] [13] [15]
• Conditions that increase susceptibility to digoxin (electrolyte abnormalities, e.g., hypokalemia,
hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia)[17] [18]
• Digoxin is largely dependent on p-glycoprotein for elimination. Thus, medications that inhibit p-
glycoprotein may increase digoxin levels and potentially cause toxicity. These are numerous,
but clinically significant ones include verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, quinidine, ketoconazole,
itraconazole, vinblastine, doxorubicin, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and erythromycin. These substances may
also inhibit cytochrome 3A4.[19] Others include clarithromycin, cyclosporine, propafenone, quinidine,
and spironolactone.

Digoxin overdose Theory
Pathophysiology
Digoxin inhibits Na+/K+ ATPase. This increases cytosolic Ca, which increases inotropy. Abnormal sodium,
potassium, or magnesium levels and acidosis increase toxicity by further depressing the Na+/K+ ATPase
pump.
Therapeutically, digoxin increases automaticity and shortens the repolarization intervals of the atria
and ventricles. There is a concurrent decrease in depolarization and conduction through the sinoatrial
and atrioventricular (AV) nodes, respectively. These changes are reflected on the ECG by a decrease
in ventricular response rate PR-interval prolongation, QT-interval shortening, and ST-segment and T-
wave forces opposite the direction of the major QRS forces (scooped ST segment). This results in the
characteristic digitalis effect.[20]
In overdose, digoxin produces two major effects that correlate with its therapeutic action:
1. Slowed conduction by increasing block at the AV node
2. Increased automatic triggered electrical activity in atrial muscle, the AV junction, the His-Purkinje
system, and the ventricular muscle (increased automaticity)
Digoxin toxicity can also cause hyperkalemia, which increases the risk of dysrhythmias. Toxicity depends on
intracellular levels and does not correlate well with serum levels. Noncardiac adverse effects may also be
mediated by inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase in other tissues.[21]

Digoxin overdose Theory
THEORY
Acute toxicity: patients who take a digoxin overdose when they are not prescribed digoxin themselves (i.e.,
patients who take an accidental or intentional overdose when not already prescribed digoxin for an existing
condition).
Acute on chronic toxicity: patients who are prescribed digoxin for an existing condition and take a digoxin
overdose. Acute overdose in patients on regular therapy is expected to be more toxic than in patients who
are not already taking therapeutic digoxin.
Chronic toxicity: patients who present with digoxin toxicity because of drug accumulation (commonly due to
renal failure) without having taken an overdose.
Case history
Case history #1
An 86-year-old woman presents with confusion and vomiting. She complains of weakness, nausea, and
decreased appetite. Her history is significant for congestive heart failure for which she takes, among
other medications, digoxin. In the hospital, she is alert and oriented in person, but not in time or place.
Vital signs are normal except for a heart rate of 56 bpm. Her physical examination demonstrates bibasilar
rales, irregular S1, S2 with an S3 gallop, and bilateral lower extremity 2+ pitting edema up to her shins.
Case history #2
A 19-year-old woman presents approximately 30 minutes after ingesting 30 of her grandmother's 0.25 mg
digoxin tablets in a suicide attempt. In the hospital, her vital signs are normal. She is in no acute distress
and has no complaints; physical examination is within expected limits. About 30 minutes after arrival, she
complains of nonspecific abdominal pain and starts vomiting.

Digoxin overdose Diagnosis
Approach
History and physical examination can provide clues towards the diagnosis of digoxin overdose. ECG, digoxin
level, electrolytes, and renal function tests should be ordered in all patients who present with suspected
digoxin toxicity or exposure. Digoxin toxicity should be suspected in patients with a history of heart failure
or atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. A drug history should be taken, including
any supplements, herbal remedies, over the counter medications and any plant ingestions, with particular
attention to the use of p-glycoprotein/cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors.
History and exam in acute toxicity
In acute digoxin toxicity, patients or family members may provide the history of exposure or suicidality.
Acute digoxin toxicity is characterized by patients being asymptomatic for minutes to hours after an
exposure to digoxin, followed by a rapid deterioration. The symptoms usually include nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain (less common), and may include palpitations, syncope and
dyspnea. Acute digoxin toxicity may cause virtually any dysrhythmia. The 2 medications used most
commonly in clinical practice are digoxin and digitoxin.
History and exam in chronic toxicity
Chronic digoxin toxicity is more common in elderly patients. It has a more indolent course with a less
obvious presentation. It should be considered if the following symptoms are present: nausea, anorexia,
abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea, disturbances of color vision with
a tendency to yellow halos (xanthopsia), blurred vision, and diplopia. Patients most often present with
gastrointestinal signs (anorexia and vomiting) and generalized nonspecific complaints (generalized
weakness and malaise), but could also present with central nervous system depression.
Investigations to order
A 12-lead ECG should be performed in all patients who present with suspected digoxin toxicity or
exposure.
Serum digoxin concentrations should be measured, but are only truly reflective after distribution is
complete (4 to 6 hours after the last dose). Levels are drawn immediately on presentation, but often a
second level will be required, as levels drawn too early are not reflective of distributed levels. There is
no exact serum digoxin concentration (SDC) that is predictive of chronic toxicity. There are a number of
factors that can affect a patient's susceptibility to digoxin (e.g., hypokalemia, volume status, comorbidities,
age, and chronic disease).[22] Patients not taking digoxin may have measurable digoxin levels that
result from high circulating amounts of endogenous digoxin-like substances (EDLS). Conditions such
as pregnancy, renal failure, and hypothermia are associated with EDLS; however, levels rarely exceed
0.2 nanograms/mL in these patients. Also, spironolactone and nondigoxin cardioactive corticosteroids
such as digitoxin and oleandrin can cause false-positive elevations of digoxin levels. Additionally,
Asian, Siberian, and American ginseng are known to interfere with serum digoxin measurements using
fluorescence polarization technology.[25]
Serum potassium concentrations are important as a marker for prognosis in acute digoxin toxicity, and
also reflect the severity of the toxicity.
Renal function should be assessed as this influences the rate of clearance of digoxin from the
bloodstream.

Digoxin overdose Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
In addition, serum magnesium should be measured, as low levels exacerbate cardiac manifestations of
digoxin toxicity.
Diagnostic findings in acute toxicity
Classically, patients with acute digoxin toxicity have:
• Dysrhythmias, which are associated with increased automaticity and decreased atrioventricular
(AV) conduction (e.g., atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with high-degree AV block, nonparoxysmal
atrial tachycardia with block, accelerated junctional rhythms, and/or bidirectional ventricular
tachycardia).[26] Premature ventricular contractions are the most common dysrhythmia. Bigeminy
or trigeminy occur frequently. The only rhythm disturbances that are not definitively associated
with digoxin toxicity are supraventricular tachyarrhythmias with a rapid ventricular response: for
example, supraventricular tachycardia and sinus tachycardia.
• Hyperkalemia (≥5.5 mEq/L).
• Elevated digoxin serum concentration above 0.9 nanograms/mL in patients taking digoxin for heart
failure.[24]

Diagnostic findings in chronic toxicity
Chronic digoxin toxicity is most often associated with:
• Bradyarrhythmias (ventricular tachyarrhythmias also occur)
• Normal or low serum potassium concentrations (they can also be high)
• Elevated serum digoxin concentrations (above the recommended therapeutic levels of <1
nanogram/mL in patients taking digoxin for heart failure)
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
digoxin exposure (common)
• History of exposure to digoxin or digitoxin should be confirmed if possible.

visual symptoms (uncommon)
• Typically include disturbances of color vision with a tendency to perceive yellow halos around objects
(xanthopsia), blurred vision, and diplopia. Xanthopsia is not as common in digoxin overdose as it is in
digitoxin overdose.
Other diagnostic factors

cardiovascular symptoms (common)
• Typically include palpitations, syncope, arrhythmias, and dyspnea.
Risk factors
Strong
age >55 years
• Older adults (aged >55 years) are at risk for toxicity from a number of mechanisms, such as dosing
error, chronic medical conditions, decreased clearance, increased bioavailability, and interaction with
other chronic medications.[5]
decreased renal clearance
• Patients with decreased glomerular filtration rate are more susceptible to digoxin toxicity because of
decreased clearance of digoxin from the serum.
hyperkalemia (>5.0 mEq/L)
• Patients with hyperkalemia (>5.0 mEq/L) are more at risk of digoxin toxicity and of dysrhythmias,
leading to a worse prognosis. However, acute digoxin toxicity can also cause hyperkalemia. Other
causes of hyperkalemia include hemolysis, renal failure, and use of ACE inhibitors.
hypokalemia (<3.0 to 3.5 mEq/L)
• Patients with therapeutic serum concentrations of digoxin can be symptomatic if they have
hypokalemia.[22]
concomitant use of specific drugs
• Digoxin is largely dependent on p-glycoprotein for elimination. Thus, medications that inhibit p-
glycoprotein may increase digoxin levels and potentially cause toxicity.
• These are numerous, but clinically significant ones include verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone,
quinidine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, vinblastine, doxorubicin, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and

erythromycin.[19] Others include clarithromycin, cyclosporine, propafenone, quinidine, and
spironolactone.
• Other mechanisms may also affect digoxin levels. Amiodarone decreases renal clearance and
displaces digoxin from its protein-binding sites. Quinidine is also able to displace digoxin from its
protein-binding sites. Spironolactone may increase prerenal state, thereby potentiating a state of
decreased renal clearance. Verapamil may decrease renal clearance. Antibiotics inhibit antibacterial
activity (against gastrointestinal bacteria) and could increase the amount of digoxin absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract.

Digoxin overdose Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The main goal of treatment is to correct cardiac toxicity. Treatment of cardiac toxicity usually leads to
resolution of central nervous system and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.
Initial treatment includes:
• General supportive care
• Discontinuation of digoxin therapy and prevention of further exposure
• Prevention of further GI absorption
• Administration of digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin immune Fab)
• Treatment of specific complications: for example, dysrhythmias and electrolyte abnormalities
Treatment of chronic toxicity is based on a clinical syndrome, not the serum digoxin concentration, which
might be just above the therapeutic range. If a serum digoxin concentration cannot be obtained, patients are
managed based on their presentation, ECG findings, and laboratory results. If toxicity is suspected and the
patient is unstable, antidotal therapy is administered prior to confirmatory results. For patients with chronic
digitalis poisoning, therapy may require only a few Fab vials. There is no change in therapy for renal failure
other than to note that the elimination half-life of digoxin is prolonged in patients with renal failure.
Supportive care
General supportive care includes attaching patients to a cardiac monitor, providing intravenous fluids in
patients with hypotension or volume depletion (with caution for patients with congestive heart failure),
supplemental oxygen, and/or repletion of electrolytes in patients with electrolyte abnormalities.
Digoxin binding therapy
Digoxin binding (with digoxin immune Fab) is used in patients with the following features:
• Severe toxicity or hemodynamic compromise
• Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias
• Ventricular dysrhythmias
• Any patient with digoxin overdose and potassium concentrations >5.0 mEq/L
• Acute ingestion of >4 mg in a healthy child (or 0.1 mg/kg)
• Acute ingestion of >10 mg in a healthy adult
• Serum concentration of ≥10 nanograms/mL 4-6 hours after ingestion (steady state)
• Serum concentration of ≥15 nanograms/mL at any time
If indicated, 15 vials of Fab is the quantity typically needed to treat one patient.[27] One study suggests
1-2 vials administered in a stepwise fashion based on clinical response.[28] Patients who receive digoxin
immune Fab have a drop in the serum potassium as it moves intracellularly.[29] [30] [31] Some patients
who have been treated for hyperkalemia and who have also received digoxin immune Fab develop
profound hypokalemia. Therefore, serial potassium measurements are made when patients receive both
digoxin immune Fab and other therapies to decrease potassium.[32]
After administration of digoxin immune Fab, serum digoxin concentrations are usually falsely elevated (10-
to 30-fold). Serum digoxin concentration can be measured again 3-4 days after the dose is given, but has

Digoxin overdose Management
been reported to be elevated for up to 10 days, especially in patients with renal insufficiency.[33] [34] [35]
In certain patients with chronic digoxin toxicity, supportive case is suggested to have similar outcomes to
digoxin Fab.[36]
Management of electrolyte abnormalities
In patients with chronic digoxin toxicity, hyperkalemia is only corrected (e.g., with insulin/glucose) if it is
considered life-threatening, because of the risk of producing hypokalemia. One study showed that insulin
interacts directly with Na+/K+ ATPase pumps and alters the effect of digoxin.[37] This supports the finding
that for patients with diabetes, insulin does not have cardioprotective effects after digoxin intoxication.
Calcium is not used to treat hyperkalemia in patients with suspected digoxin toxicity as it may induce
arrhythmia or cardiac arrest.
Patients with acute digoxin toxicity and serum potassium concentrations ≥5.0 mEq/L are treated with
digoxin immune Fab; those with hyperkalemia have high mortality rates.
Patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia require additional potassium or magnesium with careful
monitoring to restore normal serum levels.
GI decontamination
There is a role for GI decontamination with activated charcoal in patients with an acute ingestion of
digoxin with low to moderate toxicity.[38] [39] [40] The primary goal of activated charcoal is to decrease GI
absorption of the drug.[39] [40]
Bradycardia management
If digoxin-binding therapy is not immediately available patients with symptomatic bradycardia can be
treated with atropine.[32]  In adults, atropine can be given every 3-5 minutes until there is a response or
the 3-mg maximum dose is reached. Pediatric patients with symptomatic bradycardia require lower doses
of atropine. Alternatively, a temporary pacing wire can be inserted in patients with evidence of significant
bradycardia or atrioventricular (AV) block and hemodynamic compromise if digoxin-specific antibody (Fab)
fragments are not readily available.
Tachyarrhythmia management
Type IB anti-arrhythmics (e.g., phenytoin, lidocaine) can be used if digoxin immune Fab is unavailable or
is being prepared and patients have rapid ventricular dysrhythmias unresponsive to supportive measures.
Transthoracic electrical cardioversion for atrial tachyarrhythmias is associated with the development of
lethal ventricular dysrhythmias, so is not used.[41]
Overdrive suppression with a transvenous pacemaker is also avoided because of associated iatrogenic
complications that have been seen in as many as 36% of patients.[42] [43]
Patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia require defibrillation along with
immunotherapy.
Hemodynamic compromise management
In patients with signs of hemodynamic insufficiency and/or compromise (e.g., hypotension, altered
consciousness), digoxin immune Fab is given as primary management. As a bridge to the administration
of digoxin immune Fab, intravenous fluids and direct-acting vasopressors (e.g., phenylephrine,

norepinephrine) are used. Cardiac contractility (inotropy) is typically preserved in patients with digoxin
toxicity. Alternatively, a temporary pacing wire can be inserted in patients with evidence of significant
bradycardia or AV block and hemodynamic compromise if digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) fragments are
not readily available.
Ongoing monitoring and change of medication
Ideally, digoxin is discontinued and a different medication for rate control or a different inotrope prescribed
(for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or CHF, respectively). If the patient has to remain on digoxin for some
reason, then the dose of digoxin is adjusted for the patient's medication profile. Glomerular filtration rate
and serum digoxin concentration is monitored regularly (every 2-4 weeks).

Acute
acute ingestion, low to moderate
toxicity
1st activated charcoal
Primary options
» charcoal, activated: 1 g/kg orally as a single
dose, repeat every 2-4 hours if required,
maximum 4 doses total
» Activated charcoal is administered to decrease
gastrointestinal absorption of the drug; however,
serum concentrations may also be decreased by
facilitating gut dialysis via the enterohepatic and
enteroenteric recirculation of digoxin (and other
cardioactive corticosteroids).[39] [40]
» Effective in the first 6-8 hours post-ingestion.
» If severe toxicity, activated charcoal may
be omitted and digoxin immune Fab given
immediately.
» Caution should be taken in patients who vomit
or those with altered mental status. They are at
risk of pulmonary aspiration when drinking the
solution.
plus supportive care
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» General supportive care includes attaching
patients to a cardiac monitor, providing
intravenous fluids in patients with hypotension
or volume depletion (with caution for patients
with congestive heart failure), supplemental
oxygen, and/or repletion of electrolytes in
patients with electrolyte abnormalities. Patients
with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia require
additional potassium or magnesium with careful
monitoring to restore normal serum levels.
with hypokalemia plus potassium replacement
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Potassium should be given via cautious
intravenous infusion to restore serum potassium
to normal levels.

Acute
serum concentration of ≥10 nanograms/mL 4-6
hours after ingestion (steady state); and serum
concentration of ≥15 nanograms/mL at any time.
» There are formulae available within the
package insert for calculating the neutralising
dose of digoxin immune Fab, based on total
body burden or total dose ingested.[44] In acute
toxicity, 15 vials of Fab is the quantity typically
needed to treat one patient.[27] One study
suggests 1-2 vials administered in a stepwise
fashion based on clinical response.[28] For
patients with chronic digitalis poisoning, therapy
may require only a few Fab vials.
» Patients who receive digoxin immune Fab
have a drop in the serum potassium as it moves
intracellularly.[29] [30] [31] Some patients
who have been treated for hyperkalemia and
who have also received digoxin immune Fab
develop profound hypokalemia. Therefore,
serial potassium measurements are made when
patients receive both digoxin immune Fab and
other therapies to decrease potassium.[32]
» After administration of digoxin immune Fab,
serum digoxin concentrations are usually
falsely elevated (10- to 30-fold). Serum digoxin
concentration can be measured again 3-4 days
after dose is given, but has been reported to be
elevated for up to 10 days, especially in patients
with renal insufficiency.[33] [34] [35]
» Patients may rarely develop a rate-related
infusion reaction, in which case the infusion
should be stopped and restarted at a slower
infusion rate. There is a higher risk for a reaction
if no filter is used when giving digoxin immune
Fab.
» After administration, serum total digoxin
concentrations are no longer useful because
elevated levels reflect both free digoxin and
digoxin bound to Fab.[33] There are assays
that are able to determine free digoxin serum
concentrations, but they are not always routinely
available.

Primary options
» atropine: children: 0.02 mg/kg (minimum
0.1 mg, maximum 0.5 mg) intravenously as a
single dose, may repeat once only, maximum
1 mg/total dose; adults: 0.5 mg intravenously
every 3-5 minutes, maximum 3 mg/total dose
» If digoxin-binding therapy is not immediately
available patients with symptomatic bradycardia
can be treated with atropine.[32]
» In adults, atropine can be given every 3-5
minutes until there is a response or the 3-mg
maximum dose is reached. Pediatric patients
with symptomatic bradycardia require lower
doses of atropine.
» Alternatively, a temporary pacing wire can be
inserted in patients with evidence of significant
bradycardia or AV block and hemodynamic
compromise if digoxin-specific antibody (Fab)
fragments are not readily available.

Acute
atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction. Phenytoin
may perhaps enhance AV nodal conduction.[45]
[46] Phenytoin can terminate digitalis-induced
cardiac arrhythmias better than lidocaine.[46]
» Type 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide)
and 1C (e.g., flecainide, propafenone)
antiarrhythmics are contraindicated.
Ongoing
acute or chronic toxicity after initial
treatment
1st prescription of alternative drug and
discontinuation of digoxin
» Ideally, digoxin is discontinued and a different
medicine for rate control or a different inotrope
prescribed (for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or
congestive heart failure, respectively).
2nd digoxin dose adjustment and regular
monitoring
» If the patient has to remain on digoxin for some
reason, then the dose of digoxin is adjusted
for the patient's medication profile. Glomerular
filtration rate and serum digoxin concentration is
monitored regularly (every 2-4 weeks).
Primary prevention
Certain cardiac conditions, such as intermittent complete heart block, myocarditis, second degree
atrioventricular block, supraventricular arrhythmias associated with accessory conducting pathways, and
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, are contraindications to prescribing digoxin. Digoxin should be used with
caution in some patients, such as those with renal impairment.
Patients on digoxin require periodic monitoring of their renal function and adjustment of their digoxin dose if
creatinine clearance has changed.
Routine monitoring of serum digoxin concentration is not recommended. Serum digoxin concentration
is measured 2-3 weeks after any change in therapy or addition of a new medication. Serum digoxin
concentrations are unreliable if obtained earlier than 6 hours after a dose of digoxin.[23] The current
therapeutic serum digoxin concentration is 0.5 to 0.9 nanograms/mL in patients with heart failure.[24] It
should be noted that toxicity can occur even when the serum digoxin concentration is within the therapeutic
range, though this is extremely rare. Therefore, results need to be interpreted within the clinical context.
Patients with renal impairment, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypothyroidism may be at higher risk of
digoxin intoxication than others.[23]

Digoxin overdose Management
MANAGEMENT
Secondary prevention
Alternative treatments are effective for two of the major clinical indications for digoxin, congestive heart
failure and atrial fibrillation, and may be considered in place of digoxin, particularly in a patient who has
experienced toxicity.[23] [24]
Patient discussions
If a patient suspects that they have overdosed on their medication, they should seek urgent medical
attention. Patients should also beware inadvertent overdose of cardiac glycosides, which can result from
herbal remedies or plant ingestion, and to consult their physician prior to initiating such regimens. Toxicity
can also occur because of drug accumulation (commonly due to renal failure) without the patient having
taken an overdose of their prescribed medication.

Digoxin overdose Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
After administration of digoxin immune Fab, total serum digoxin concentrations are usually elevated (10-
to 30-fold) as they include both free and bound digoxin. Serum digoxin concentration can be measured
again 3-4 days after dose is given but has been reported to be elevated for up to 10 days, especially in
patients with renal insufficiency.[33][35]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
anaphylactoid (anaphylaxis-like) reaction to digoxin
immune Fab
short term low
This usually is a rate-related phenomenon associated with the infusion of Fab minutes after infusion is
started. A membrane filter will reduce the risk of a reaction. If the reaction occurs, the infusion needs to be
stopped and restarted at a slower rate.
recurrence of previous underlying atrial fibrillation or
heart failure after digoxin immune Fab therapy
short term low
Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs at a median of 7 days after therapy with Fab, affecting about 2% of treated
patients in one study.[49] Patients who have been treated with Fab are monitored for development of
uncontrolled AF or worsening heart failure and given additional treatment as required.
cardiac arrest short term low
There have been reported cases of patients who had cardiac arrest with prolonged resuscitation who
received digoxin immune Fab after the arrest and recovered.[31]
Prognosis
The prognosis for patients who are treated appropriately is very good. Patients generally have no long-term
adverse outcomes related to their digoxin toxicity.[29] [48] Patients who present with acute digoxin toxicity
and have serum potassium concentrations of ≥5.0 mEq/L, who remain untreated and/or undiagnosed, have
a mortality of 50%.[42] Patients who present with chronic digoxin toxicity and remain undiagnosed and/or
untreated have a reported mortality of 5% to 13%.[5]

advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
