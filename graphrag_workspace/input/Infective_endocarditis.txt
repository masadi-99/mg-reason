Infective endocarditis Overview
Summary
Infective endocarditis (IE) often presents nonspecifically, most commonly with fever and signs/symptoms of
embolism.
Historical sources of bacteremia should be considered, such as indwelling vascular catheters, intravenous
drug use, and recent dental work.
Symptoms are often subtle and examination is often unrevealing, but may demonstrate cardiac murmur,
peripheral emboli, Osler nodes, Roth spots, and Janeway lesions.
In cases of suspected IE, the patient should be evaluated urgently and early input from cardiology and an
infectious disease or microbiology specialist should be sought. A multidisciplinary approach (e.g., with an
“endocarditis team”) is crucial for diagnosis and management.
At least three sets of blood cultures taken at different sites and at different times (ideally >6 hours between
the first and last samples if clinical status allows) should be obtained prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy
and echocardiography. However, if the patient is unwell (e.g., with evidence of sepsis) do not delay empiric
antibiotic therapy.
Antimicrobial therapy is guided by presentation, clinical findings, and organism virulence.
Definition
IE is an infection involving the endocardial surface of the heart, including the valvular structures, the chordae
tendineae, sites of septal defects, or the mural endocardium.[1]

Infective endocarditis Theory
Epidemiology
IE is becoming more frequent.[17] In the US, one study found that between 2000 and 2011, the incidence of
IE increased from 11 per 100,000 to 15 per 100,000.[18] Between 2000 and 2020 in Europe, IE incidence
increased 4.1% per year.[17] Another study looking at the incidence of drug use-related IE between 2002 to
2016 found the overall incidence of IE increased from 18 per 10,000 to 29 per 10,000, and the incidence in
those with drug use-related IE increased from 48 per 10,000 to 79 per 10,000.[19] In hospital mortality from
IE is 15% to 30%.[20] [21]
In resource-rich countries, IE is more common in the setting of previous valve surgery or as a consequence
of iatrogenic or nosocomial infection, whereas chronic rheumatic disease is an uncommon antecedent.
Rheumatic heart disease remains the leading cause of IE in developing countries.[22] [23]
IE in pregnancy is rare and is associated with intravenous drug abuse and pre-existing cardiac disease and,
in particular, mechanical prosthetic valves, where the incidence is higher than in the general population.[24]
 Maternal mortality reaches 18% to 22% and is usually due to embolic events or heart failure.[7][24]
Etiology
The overall causative agents in IE are well documented and have been relatively stable, based on
population-based studies over time. The most common pathogens are listed below; these together with any
underlying risk factors indicate the most likely causative organism:[2] [7][21][23][25]
• Staphylococcus aureus  (31% of cases)
• Viridans group streptococci
• Streptococcus gallolyticus  (formerly  Streptococcus bovis )
• Oral streptococci (  Streptococcus mitis ,  Streptococcus sanguinis ,  Streptococcus anginosus , 
Streptococcus salivarius ,  Streptococcus downei , and  Streptococcus mutans )
• Coagulase-negative staphylococci
• Enterococci
• Culture-negative  Haemophilus  species,  Aggregatibacter ,  Cardiobacterium hominis ,  Eikenella
corrodens , and  Kingella  species (HACEK)
• Fungi
• Haemophilus parainfluenzae
• Coxiella burnetii
• Brucella  species
Known but rare causative organisms of IE include:[26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]
• Trophyerma whipplei
• Actinomyces
• Nocardia
• Malassezia furfur
• Serratia  species
• Enterobacter cloacae
• Mycobacterium chimaera
• Rothia
• Acinetobacter  species
• Klebsiella  species

Infective endocarditis Theory
THEORY
Patients who develop native valve endocarditis in the absence of intravenous drug use commonly present
with viridans group streptococci, enterococci, or staphylococci, with other pathogens being less frequent.
Intravenous drug users often present with right-sided valvular involvement and are more likely to have  S
aureus , streptococci, gram-negative bacilli, or polymicrobial infections.[2] [3]
Prosthetic valve endocarditis is most commonly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci,  S aureus ,
enterococci, or gram-negative bacilli.[7] It should be noted that early prosthetic valve endocarditis is often
caused by  Staphylococcus epidermidis .[2][7]

Pathophysiology
IE typically develops on the valvular surfaces of the heart, which have sustained endothelial damage
secondary to turbulent blood flow. As a result, platelets and fibrin adhere to the underlying collagen surface
and create a prothrombotic milieu. Bacteremia leads to colonization of the thrombus and perpetuates further
fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation, which develops into a mature infected vegetation.[35]
Acute IE is usually associated with more virulent organisms, classically  Staphylococcus aureus . Thrombus
is formed by the offending organism and  S aureus  may invade endothelial cells and increase the expression
of adhesion molecules as well as prothrombotic factors.[36]

Infective endocarditis Theory
Clinical classification[1]
• Acute: typically develops over a period of days to weeks and is characterized by spiking fevers,
tachycardia, fatigue, and progressive damage to cardiac structures.
• Subacute: typically develops over the course of weeks to months. Often, patients will complain of
vague constitutional symptoms.
Classification by nidus or location of infection
Native valve endocarditis (NVE)
• Patients who develop NVE in the absence of intravenous drug use commonly present with viridans
group streptococci, enterococci, or staphylococci, with other pathogens being less frequent.
Intravenous drug users often present with right-sided valvular involvement and are more likely to have 
Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci, gram-negative bacilli, or polymicrobial infections.[2] [3]
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)
• Between 10% and 30% of all cases of IE occur in the context of prosthetic heart valves.[2] [4] PVE
is defined as being early or late depending on whether it arises within 1 year of valve replacement
(early) or after 1 year (late). The focus is placed on the likely causative organisms involved at different
time points in the disease process. Early PVE is often caused by  S aureus  or coagulase-negative
staphylococci.[5][6] [7] Late PVE tends to be caused by the same organisms as NVE, and nonsurgical
treatment in this group may be effective.
Device-related endocarditis
• The increasingly widespread use of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has contributed
to the rising incidence of this complication, though it remains relatively rare overall.[8] Estimates of
incidence vary but it is a serious complication that is often difficult to diagnose and carries with it
significant mortality.[8] [9] [10] [11]
• Although clinically challenging, distinction should be made between local device infection and device-
related IE. Device lead-associated endocarditis should be suspected in any CIED patient with systemic
infection.[9] [10] [11] Patients with lead-associated endocarditis presenting less than 6 months after
their most recent procedure are more likely to also have local device infection.[12] Those presenting
after six months are more likely to have signs of systemic infection (such as fever, chills or sweats, or
signs of sepsis) without evidence of local device infection.[9] [12] [13]
• Risk factors for device-related IE include renal failure, hematoma at the site of implantation, diabetes
mellitus, and anticoagulation.[9] [10] [11]
Right-sided endocarditis
• Infections of right-sided heart valves make up 5% to 10% of the total cases of IE, and are commonly
associated with intravenous drug users.[3] [7][14]  S aureus  is the most common causative organism
and accounts for 60% to 90% of cases.[15] [16] The tricuspid valve is the most commonly affected,
although the pulmonary valve is also susceptible to infection.[7]

Case history
Case history #1
A 31-year-old woman presents with a 1-week history of fever, chills, fatigue, and unilateral ankle pain.
Her past medical history includes mitral valve prolapse and hypothyroidism. She admits to infrequent
intravenous heroin use and has a 10-pack-year history of smoking. Physical exam reveals temperature
of 102°F (39ºC), regular heart rate 110 beats per minute, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and respiration
rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her cardiovascular exam reveals a grade 2/4 holosystolic murmur that is
loudest at the right upper sternal border. Her right ankle appears red and warm, and is very painful on
dorsiflexion.
Other presentations
There is a wide spectrum of presentations, which are often dependent on the organism responsible as
well as any underlying risk factors. Acute IE can present with septic embolic phenomenon such as stroke,
septic joint, or splenic infarct accompanied by fever and cardiac murmur. Subacute IE may be associated
primarily with constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, weakness, and peripheral stigmata such as
embolic phenomenon, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, or splinter hemorrhages.

Infective endocarditis Diagnosis
Approach
All patients with bacteremia should be suspected of potentially having IE, particularly those with an audible
murmur. The classic new or worsening cardiac murmur is rare. Patients who develop new regurgitant
murmurs are at increased risk of developing congestive heart failure. Elderly or immunocompromised
patients may present atypically, without fever. As the population ages, IE is becoming more frequent in
patients ages over 70 years, with trends toward worsening outcomes.[61] Diagnosis in older people is often
made later in the course of the disease as a result of more indolent presentations, and this undoubtedly
contributes to poorer outcomes. While it is uncommon in pregnancy, IE should be considered in pregnant
patients who present with fever accompanied by cardiac signs, including tachycardia, new or changing heart
murmurs and evidence of septic emboli.[7][24] The same risk factors for IE pertain to pregnant patients as
nonpregnant patients.[7] [24]
Initial laboratory studies should include basic complete blood count (CBC) and electrolyte panel, at least two
sets of blood cultures (ideally taken >6 hours apart if clinical status allows), and urinalysis. Blood cultures
are recommended to be taken prior to initiation of antibiotics.[20] All patients should have an initial ECG, and
subsequently an echocardiogram must be obtained.[6] [7][62][63]

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend using the Modified
Duke Criteria in patients with suspected IE.[20]
Acute
Patients often present with signs and symptoms of peripheral or central emboli, or with evidence of
decompensated congestive heart failure. Therefore, urgent evaluation for IE is important for any patients
who present with fever in conjunction with headache, meningeal signs, stroke symptoms, chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; and for any patients with unexplained
fever who are at high risk of IE (e.g., congenital or acquired valvular disease, previous IE, prosthetic heart
valves, congenital or heritable heart malformations, immunodeficiency, injection drug use).[20] Arthralgias
and back pain may also result from peripheral septic emboli. Classic immunologic features (e.g., Osler
nodes, Roth spots) are uncommon, due to rapid onset of disease process.
Subacute
Patients present with fever and chills, nonspecific constitutional symptoms (night sweats, malaise,
fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, myalgias), or palpitations. Physical exam is often nonspecific, but subacute
presentations are more likely to exhibit classic exam findings such as Janeway lesions (hemorrhagic,
macular, painless plaques with a predilection for the palms and soles), Osler nodes (small, painful,
nodular lesions usually found on the pads of the fingers or toes) splinter hemorrhages (commonly noted
in the nails of the upper and lower extremities), or cutaneous infarcts. Palatal petechiae may also be

present. Fundoscopy may detect Roth spots (oval, pale, retinal lesions surrounded by hemorrhage). Skin

Infective endocarditis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
IE in the intensive care unit (ICU)
There are multiple challenges to diagnosing IE in the ICU. Presentation is often atypical, and may be
concealed by other pathology. Furthermore, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is likely to be less
diagnostically accurate, owing to the practical difficulties of scanning in the ICU. Hence, transesophageal
echocardiogram (TEE) must be considered at an earlier stage in the diagnostic process.
Laboratory tests
Blood cultures are the most important laboratory test for confirming IE. At least three sets of blood
cultures from different venipuncture sites should be taken, the first and last samples taken at least one
hour apart (ideally >6 hours apart if clinical status allows).[6] [7] Blood culture results taken this way are
positive in 90% of patients with IE.[20] Cultures should not be taken from indwelling lines, to minimize risk
of contamination.
However, empiric antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while waiting to take three sets of blood
cultures if the patient is unwell (e.g., with sepsis).[64] The volume of blood sent for culture is more
important than the number of sets of cultures.[65] The most common cause of culture-negative
endocarditis is antibiotic therapy preceding blood cultures.[66]
Do not routinely request extended incubation of blood cultures in suspected endocarditis.[20] [67]
Other initial laboratory studies should include basic CBC and electrolyte panel, C-reactive protein
(CRP), and urinalysis. If the patient is febrile, laboratory signs of infection (such as elevated CRP or
leukocytosis), anemia, and microscopic hematuria support a diagnosis of IE. However, these are not
specific for the diagnosis of IE.
In practice, CRP is also useful as a baseline test and to monitor response to treatment. Elevated CRP >40
mg/L is an independent risk factor for embolic events in patients with IE.[68] Testing for rheumatoid factor
and measuring erythrocyte sedimentation rate and complement levels may also be helpful. Urinalysis
is used to evaluate renal involvement. In addition, electrolyte panel, glucose, and liver function tests are
used to mark progress of the disease, and to assess vital organ function and systemic effects of infection.
Emerging tests
Mean platelet volume (MPV) is associated with platelet activation which occurs in the setting of
endothelial damage. Increased MPV has been shown to be an independent predictor of embolic events in
patients with IE.
Anti‐beta-2‐glycoprotein I antibodies enhance activation of platelets and the coagulation cascade and
have been associated with increased risk of embolic events.
D-dimer and troponin I have also been linked to increased embolic risk but are nonspecific and may be
surrogate markers for severity of illness rather than independent predictors of embolic events.[68]
Echocardiography
Echocardiography should be performed in all patients with suspected IE.[6] [7] [62] [63][69]
 Echocardiography is important not only for confirming or ruling out the diagnosis but also for evaluation
of complications and prognosis.[62] The decision to obtain a TTE rather than TEE is often difficult and
has been considered by various guidelines.[6] [7][62] [63][69] The American Heart Association and the

Infective endocarditis Diagnosis
American College of Cardiology recommend that any patient suspected of having native valve IE should
be screened with TTE to evaluate for the presence of a vegetation, and to assess any effects on valvular
function.[20] If negative, and suspicion still remains, patients should undergo TEE.[15] [63] TEE is the
preferred form of echocardiography in people with prosthetic material suspected to have IE.[15] [63] TEE
is also indicated in patients with a positive TTE, but where complications are suspected or likely, and
before cardiac surgery during active IE. 3-dimensional echocardiography can provide additional anatomic
information and may be used in concert with traditional 2-dimensional echocardiography.[70] When TEE
is contraindicated or not feasible, intracardiac echocardiography may be an alternative for diagnosing
IE.[71]
ECG
An ECG should be undertaken, as progression of the infection may lead to conduction system
disease.[72] Conduction abnormalities secondary to IE (mainly first-, second-, and third-degree
atrioventricular block) are uncommon but are associated with worse prognosis and higher mortality
compared with patients without conduction abnormalities.[73]
Cardiac computed tomography (CT)
CT imaging is used for the diagnosis of native and prosthetic valve IE and for detection of complications
of IE, including abscesses, pseudoaneurysms, and fistulae.[74] [75] CT has been found to compare
favorably with TTE in detecting valvular abnormalities in patients with IE, but it may miss small defects
(e.g., small leaflet perforations [≤2 mm diameter], small vegetations <10 mm).[7][76] Whole-body and
brain CT can be used to look for distant lesions, systemic complications of IE, and septic emboli, as well
as having a role in detecting extracardiac sources of bacteremia and potentially alternate diagnoses in
patients where IE has been excluded.[6] [7] CT angiography is a sensitive and specific test for detecting
mycotic arterial aneurysms; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior for assessment of neurologic
complications in terms of imaging, but is limited by accessibility and availability.[6] [7]
Head MRI
MRI is of less diagnostic value than CT, but is the imaging modality of choice when investigating
the cerebral complications of IE, with studies consistently reporting cerebral infarcts in up to 80% of
patients.[7] [77][78] MRI reveals cerebral lesions in 50% of patients who do not demonstrate neurologic
symptoms.[79] MRI is also used to assess spinal involvement in IE, including spondylodiscitis and
vertebral osteomyelitis.[7]
Nuclear imaging and photon emission tomography (PET)
Single-PET/CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT may be particularly useful in patients with “possible
IE” defined according to Duke criteria, in the demonstration of infectious embolic events, and in cases of
suspected prosthetic valve IE where echocardiography is not diagnostic.[20] [75][80] [81] [82] [83] [84]

fever/chills (common)
• Most common presenting complaint.[7][21] Elderly or immunocompromised patients may present
atypically, without fever.[7] Urgent evaluation for IE is important for any patient who presents with fever
in conjunction with headache, meningeal signs, stroke symptoms, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,

night sweats, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, myalgias (common)
• Nonspecific constitutional symptoms.
weakness (common)
• The nature of weakness can be constitutional or focal. Systemic emboli should be suspected if
patients present with asymmetric weakness consistent with stroke.
arthralgias (common)
• May represent a constitutional symptom or could be secondary to septic emboli to the affected joint.
headache (common)
• May represent a constitutional symptom or could be secondary to septic emboli.
shortness of breath (common)
• Dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are features of congestive heart
failure.
meningeal signs (uncommon)
• Secondary to septic emboli.
cardiac murmur (uncommon)
• The classic new or worsening cardiac murmur is rare. Patients who develop new regurgitant murmurs
are at increased risk of developing congestive heart failure.
Janeway lesions (uncommon)
• Hemorrhagic, macular, painless plaques with a predilection for the palms and soles.

chest pain (uncommon)
• Can present with ischemic chest pain secondary to decompensated heart failure due to acute valvular
regurgitation or coronary artery emboli.
back pain (uncommon)
• Could represent discitis from septic emboli.
palatal petechiae (uncommon)

Risk factors
Strong
prior history of infectious endocarditis
• Regarded as one of the conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from
endocarditis.[6] [7]
presence of artificial prosthetic heart valves
• Regarded as one of the conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from

Infective endocarditis Diagnosis
certain types of congenital heart disease
• Conditions meeting the American Heart Association criteria for being at highest risk of adverse
outcome from endocarditis include: unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, including palliative
shunts and conduits; completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device
placed by surgery or catheter intervention, during the first 6 months after the procedure; repaired
congenital heart disease with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic
device (which inhibit endothelialization); surgical or transcatheter pulmonary artery valve or conduit
placement, such as Melody valve and Contegra conduit.[40]
• The European Society of Cardiology classifies a patient as being at highest risk of developing IE if they
have untreated cyanotic congenital heart disease, or congenital heart disease that has been repaired
with a prosthetic material (including valved conduits or systemic-to-pulmonary shunts).[7]
• The prevalence of congenital heart disease in adults has increased as a result of improved treatment
options in childhood.[41]
postheart transplant (patients who develop a cardiac valvulopathy)
• Regarded as one of the conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from
endocarditis.[42]
immunocompromised state
• Patients with compromised immune systems are more susceptible to infections, including IE. Many
conditions can weaken the immune system including older age, poorly controlled diabetes, kidney
disease, liver disease, malignancy, chronic steroid use, and history of solid organ transplantation.[21]
[43] [44]
Weak
presence of cardiac implanted electronic device or intravascular catheters
(e.g., for hemodialysis)
• May be associated with increased risk of developing IE.[11] [45]
• Risk factors for device-related IE include renal failure, hematoma at the site of implantation, diabetes
mellitus, and anticoagulation.[9] [10] [11]
acquired degenerative valve disease
• There is good evidence that patients with congenital bicuspid aortic valvular stenosis are at increased
risk; however, less evidence is available regarding degenerative aortic valvular stenosis.[7][21] Limited
evidence suggests that mitral annular calcification can also act as a nidus for IE.[46]
mitral valve prolapse or bicuspid valve prolapse
• The prevalence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in the general population is high, and patients with
MVP have a three- to eight-times increased risk of IE compared to people with structurally normal
hearts.[47]
• Patients with MVP and those with bicuspid valve prolapse have a higher incidence of viridans group
streptococci IE and IE from suspected odontologic origin than high-risk patients.[47] [48] MVP with
concomitant mitral regurgitation places patients at greater risk.[47] There is much debate regarding the
efficacy of prophylaxis in patients with nonregurgitant MVP.[47]

hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with an intermediate risk of IE.[7][49]
intravenous drug use
• These patients are at greater risk of developing acute  Staphylococcus aureus  endocarditis.[3] One
in every 10 invasive staphylococcal infections in the United States is attributable to intravenous drug
use.[3]
• Although tricuspid involvement has been shown to be significantly more frequent in endocarditis
associated with intravenous drug use compared with no intravenous drug use, one study found that
left-sided endocarditis was still more common than right-sided endocarditis in both groups.[14]
• These patients have been shown to have worse clinical outcomes irrespective of drug use following
surgery.[14]
chronic Q fever
• Endocarditis is a serious complication of chronic Q fever. It typically affects middle-aged men
with a history of significant exposure to animals and usually occurs in patients with preexisting
valvular disease or who are immunocompromised.[50] Clinical presentation of chronic  Coxiella
burnetii  endocarditis should be strongly considered in the differential diagnosis of culture negative
endocarditis. A high index of suspicion in at-risk people with a fever of unknown origin, combined with
serologic testing, ensures timely diagnosis.[50]

Tests
1st test to order
Test Result
blood cultures
• At least three sets of blood cultures from different venipuncture sites
should be taken, the first and last samples taken at least one hour
apart (ideally >6 hours apart if clinical status allows).[6] [7] Blood
culture results taken this way are positive in 90% of patients with
IE.[20] Cultures should not be taken from indwelling lines, to minimize
risk of contamination.
• However, empiric antibiotic therapy should not be delayed while
waiting to take three sets of blood cultures if the patient is unwell
(e.g., with sepsis).[64] The volume of blood sent for culture is more
important than the number of sets of cultures.[65] The most common
cause of culture-negative endocarditis is antibiotic therapy preceding
blood cultures.[66] Do not routinely request extended incubation of
blood cultures in suspected endocarditis.[20] [67]
bacteremia; fungemia
echocardiogram
• Should be performed in all cases of suspected IE as early as
possible to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.[6] [7] [62] [63][75]
 Echocardiography is also important for evaluation of complications
and prognosis.[62]

• The decision to obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) rather
than transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is often difficult and
has been considered by various guidelines.[6] [7][62] [63][75] The
American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology
recommend that any patient suspected of having native valve IE
should be screened with TTE to evaluate for the presence of a
vegetation, and to assess any effects on valvular function.[20]
• TEE is the preferred form of echocardiography in people with
prosthetic material suspected to have IE.[63] TEE is also indicated in
patients with a positive TTE, but where complications are suspected
or likely, and before cardiac surgery during active IE.

cardiac CT
• CT imaging is used for the diagnosis of native and prosthetic valve
IE and for detection of complications of IE, including abscesses,
pseudoaneurysms, and fistulae.[74] [75] Cardiac CT has been found
to compare favorably with transthoracic echocardiogram in detecting
valvular abnormalities in patients with IE, but may miss small defects
(e.g., small leaflet perforations [≤2 mm diameter], small vegetations
[<10 mm]).[7][76]
• Whole-body and brain CT can be used to look for distant lesions,
systemic complications of IE, and septic emboli, as well as having a
role in detecting extracardiac sources of bacteremia and potentially
alternate diagnoses in patients where IE has been excluded.[6] [7]
 CT angiography is a sensitive and specific test for detecting mycotic
arterial aneurysms; MRI is superior for assessment of neurologic
complications in terms of imaging, but is limited by accessibility and
availability.[6] [7]

MRI
• MRI is of less diagnostic value that CT, but is the imaging modality
of choice when investigating the cerebral complications of IE, with
studies consistently reporting cerebral infarcts in up to 80% of
patients.[77] [78] MRI also reveals cerebral lesions in 50% of patients
who do not demonstrate neurologic symptoms.[79] MRI is also used
to assess spinal involvement in IE, including spondylodiscitis and
vertebral osteomyelitis.[7]

Nuclear imaging and PET
• Single-PET/CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT may be
particularly useful in patients with “possible IE” defined according to
Duke criteria, in the demonstration of infectious embolic events, and
in cases of suspected prosthetic valve IE where echocardiography is
not diagnostic.[20] [75][80] [81] [84]
• Whole-body imaging with 18F-FDG-PET/CT can be useful to detect
distant lesions, mycotic aneurysms, and portal of entry of bacteria,
and to monitor response to antibiotic treatment in patients for whom
surgery is being considered.[7][82] [84]

Rheumatic fever • Patients with rheumatic heart
disease may present very
similarly with predominantly
constitutional symptoms.

and consist of carditis,
polyarthritis, chorea,
erythema marginatum,
subcutaneous nodules,
and evidence of preceding
streptococcal infection.[87]
• Positive antistreptolysin O
antibodies or antiDNAase B.
• Echocardiogram may
demonstrate evidence of
congestive heart failure
with globalized carditis,

vegetations seen with IE.
• Endomyocardial biopsy
will reveal pathognomonic
Aschoff bodies, which are
persistent local inflammatory
lesions.
Atrial myxoma • Patients may present with
constitutional symptoms
secondary to cytokine
release or may have
systemic disease secondary
to embolic phenomenon.
• Often patients will describe
waxing and waning
symptoms as opposed to the
subacute progressive nature
of IE.
• Chest x-ray may
demonstrate characteristic
calcifications within the heart
or a small atrium.

subsequent histologic
examination is the most
specific and sensitive test for
diagnosis of atrial myxoma.

• Glomerulonephritis
• Osler nodes and Roth spots
• Rheumatoid factor
5. Microbiologic evidence:
• Positive blood culture but does not meet a major criterion as noted above
• Serologic evidence of active infection with organism consistent with IE
These criteria are used to classify patients with suspected IE as “definite”, “possible”, or “rejected”.
• Definite IE must meet:
• 2 major criteria
• 1 major criterion and at least 3 minor criteria
• 5 minor criteria
• Possible IE must meet:
• 1 major criterion and 1 or 2 minor criteria
• 3-4 minor criteria
• Rejected IE
• Does not meet criteria for definite or possible at admission with or without a firm alternative
diagnosis
If the diagnosis of IE is classified as “possible” or “rejected” but there is still a high level of clinical suspicion:
• Repeat blood cultures
• Repeat echocardiography within 5-7 days
• Perform cardiac CT angiography (CTA) to diagnose valvular lesions
• Consider other imaging modalities:
• Brain or whole-body imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], CT, PET/CT, or WBC SPECT)
to detect distant lesions in suspected native valve IE
• WBC SPECT and brain or whole-body imaging (MRI, CT, PET/CT, or WBC SPECT) to detect
distant lesions in suspected prosthetic
• PET/CT to detect pocket infection or pulmonary embolism in patients with cardiac device-related
IE
If the diagnosis of IE is confirmed “definite”, further imaging is still warranted:
• Cardiac CTA if there are suspected paravalvular complications and TEE is inconclusive
• Brain and whole-body imaging (CT, 18F-FDG-PET/CTA, and/or MRI) for all patients with confirmed IE,
in particular if there are symptoms suggestive of extracardiac complications

Infective endocarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
IE is often a difficult diagnosis to make because bacteremia may not always lead to endocardial involvement,
while endocardial involvement may occur in the absence of peripheral bacteremia following previous
antibiotic use. A systematic approach to therapy is required. The management of IE is guided by
identification of the causative organism and whether the infected valve is native or prosthetic.[6] All cases
of IE should include multidisciplinary evaluation by infectious disease, cardiology, and cardiac surgery
specialists.[6] [7][20][91]
The role of the endocarditis team
The management of IE requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of
cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, infectious diseases specialists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and
microbiologists.
The utilization of the multidisciplinary "endocarditis team" has proven vital in improving outcomes in IE
with highly significant reductions in mortality rates, as well as reduced occurrence of culture-negative
endocarditis, reduced rates of renal dysfunction, and improved surgical outcomes. This strategy has
been effective with both native and prosthetic valve IE.[92] [93] In France, where this concept has been
adopted, the 1-year mortality has reduced from 18.5% to 8.2%.[93] Current guidance supports the
management of patients with IE in reference centers by an endocarditis team.[7]
In patients with complicated IE, early referral should be made to the endocarditis team in a reference
center with rapid access to cardiac surgery facilities. Approximately 50% of IE patients will require
surgical intervention, therefore early discussion with the surgical team is paramount to optimal care and is
essential in complicated IE.[6]
Noncomplicated IE may be managed in a nonreference center, in close consultation with the endocarditis
team and the reference center.
Initial therapy
Initial management is aimed at controlling airway, breathing, and circulation.
Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be started and continued after blood cultures are obtained,
with guidance from antibiotic sensitivity data and the infectious disease experts on the multidisciplinary
team.[6] [20] It is vital to obtain blood cultures prior to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy, as one dose
often masks an underlying bacteremia and delays appropriate therapy. However, empiric antibiotic therapy
with broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed while waiting to take three sets of
blood cultures in patients with septic shock, or in those who show high-risk signs on presentation.[6][64]
 Subsequently, patients should undergo urgent echocardiography to determine the nature and extent of
valvular lesions.[62]
Recommended antibiotic regimens may differ between countries and local guidance should be
consulted.[94] Consideration of the following factors influences the choice of empiric treatment:[6] [7]
• Previous antibiotic therapy received; native or prosthetic valve involvement
• Local epidemiology and knowledge of antibiotic-resistant and culture-negative pathogens
• Community, nosocomial, or non-nosocomial healthcare-associated infection

Infective endocarditis Management
Patients who are acutely ill or present with signs and symptoms of decompensated heart failure present
the greatest challenge. Often, these patients are colonized with aggressive  Staphylococcus aureus , and
are at risk for decompensating quickly. Hemodynamic stability is the goal, and these patients often require
urgent surgical intervention if the valvular lesion is beyond repair with medical treatment alone. Acutely ill
patients presenting with decompensated heart failure will require surgery, with intravenous diuretics given
to manage pulmonary edema prior to the surgery.
Native valves: streptococci and staphylococci
Oral streptococci ( Streptococcus mitis ,  Streptococcus sanguinis ,  Streptococcus anginosus , 
Streptococcus salivarius ,  Streptococcus downei , and  Streptococcus mutans ), all part of the viridans
group, remain the primary cause of native valve endocarditis. These are either penicillin-sensitive or
relatively penicillin-resistant. Antibiotic regimens include a beta-lactam (with or without gentamicin)
or vancomycin. Cure rates of >95% can be achieved in patients treated with parenteral penicillin or
ceftriaxone for IE caused by penicillin-susceptible oral streptococci or  Streptococcus gallolyticus .[6] [7]
 Patients with native valves are generally treated for 4-6 weeks.[6] [7]
Staphylococcal endocarditis is becoming an increasingly recognized entity, often resulting in acute and
destructive disease. Treatment options for methicillin-susceptible  S aureus  (MSSA) include a beta-
lactam or daptomycin. Patients with methicillin-resistant  S aureus  (MRSA) infection are treated with
vancomycin or daptomycin.[6] Other regimens (e.g., trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole plus clindamycin) may
be recommended in some countries.[7]
S aureus  is the most common cause of endocarditis on native valves of intravenous drug users.[3]
In intravenous drug users with right-sided endocarditis, gentamicin has been shown to increase the
rate of microbial killing when used in combination with a beta-lactam.[95] However, aminoglycosides
are no longer recommended in this situation due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity.[96] [97] The
American Heart Association recommends that intravenous drug users with IE should be offered 6 weeks
of intravenous antibiotics. If this is not deemed achievable (e.g., patient decision or unplanned discharge),
initial intravenous therapy should be followed up by appropriate oral treatment, with outpatient follow-up
by addiction medicine and infectious disease specialists.[3]
Prosthetic valves: streptococci and staphylococci
Oral streptococci are a primary cause of endocarditis of prosthetic valves. Organisms are generally
penicillin-sensitive though some have a relatively high minimum inhibitory concentration and are therefore
relatively penicillin-resistant. Antibiotic regimens include a beta-lactam (with or without gentamicin) or
vancomycin. Patients with prosthetic valves are generally treated for at least 6 weeks.[6] [7]
S aureus  endocarditis infections are often rapidly progressive and carry a mortality rate greater than
45%.[98] [99] Treatment options for MSSA include a beta-lactam or vancomycin. Patients with MRSA
infection are treated with vancomycin. However, in contrast to native valve infection with  S aureus , an
aminoglycoside and rifampin are added to the treatment regimens.[6] [7]
Native and prosthetic valves: enterococci
The treatment of enterococcal endocarditis, similar to that of viridans group streptococci, is based on
the sensitivities to penicillin. Enterococci, unlike the viridans group streptococci, are not usually killed
by antimicrobials but merely inhibited. Hence prolonged administration of antimicrobials is required.
Treatment options include a beta-lactam or vancomycin plus gentamicin (or streptomycin in some
patients), or a double beta-lactam regimen. Vancomycin-resistant faecium species have emerged in

recent years and require treatment with either linezolid or daptomycin.[6] [7] Prolonged administration
(6 weeks) of antibiotics is needed because enterococci are highly resistant to drug-induced killing by
antibiotics.[7]
Native and prosthetic valves: gram-negative organisms
Increasingly, the gram-negative organisms  Haemophilus ,  Aggregatibacter  (formerly  Actinobacillus
),  Cardiobacterium ,  Eikenella , and  Kingella  (HACEK) have become ampicillin-resistant, and
ampicillin should never be used as first-line therapy for HACEK-organism endocarditis. These strains
are susceptible to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and possibly ampicillin/
sulbactam.[6] Ampicillin/sulbactam plus gentamicin may be recommended in some countries.[7]
 Fluoroquinolones have not been extensively studied in the treatment of IE, and therefore should be used
only as an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate cephalosporins or ampicillin/sulbactam.[6]
Systemic fluoroquinolone antibiotics may cause serious, disabling, and potentially long-lasting or
irreversible adverse events. This includes, but is not limited to: tendinopathy/tendon rupture; peripheral
neuropathy; arthropathy/arthralgia; aortic aneurysm and dissection; heart valve regurgitation;
dysglycemia; and central nervous system effects including seizures, depression, psychosis, and suicidal
thoughts and behavior.[100]
• Prescribing restrictions apply to the use of fluoroquinolones, and these restrictions may vary
between countries. In general, fluoroquinolones should be restricted for use in serious, life-
threatening bacterial infections only. Some regulatory agencies may also recommend that they
must only be used in situations where other antibiotics, that are commonly recommended for the
infection, are inappropriate (e.g., resistance, contraindications, treatment failure, unavailability).
• Consult your local guidelines and drug information source for more information on suitability,
contraindications, and precautions.
Other culture-negative organisms that may cause endocarditis include:  Chlamydia spp ;  Coxiella spp ; 
Bartonella spp ;  Brucella spp ; and  Legionella spp . Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist
should be sought due to the various mechanisms of antibiotic resistance found in these non-HACEK
organisms.[6]
Fungal infection
Fungal infections most frequently affect patients with prosthetic valves, or those who are
immunocompromised. Intravenous drug users are also at increased risk of fungal IE.[101] The most
common causative agents are  Candida  and  Aspergillus , with mortality 40% to 50%.[101] Treatment
includes valve replacement and antifungal therapy.[101] [102]
Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy
Stable patients with uncomplicated IE can safely complete courses of intravenous antibiotics as an
outpatient with appropriate care and follow up.[103]
Switching to oral antibiotic therapy
The 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline states that stable
patients with left-sided IE caused by streptococcus,  Enterococcus faecalis ,  S aureus , or coagulase-
negative staphylococci, and who have no evidence of paravalvular infection on transesophageal
echocardiogram (TEE), can be considered for switching to oral antibiotic therapy after initial intravenous

therapy.[20] [104] Frequent follow-up from the multidisciplinary team is required, and a follow-up TEE is
recommended 1-3 days prior to completion of the antibiotic course.[20]
Antibiotic allergies
Penicillin allergy is commonly self-reported, but often found to be spurious following formal allergy
assessment.[105]
It is important to determine the timing, extent, and nature of any previous reaction.[6]
• In general, patients with type I hypersensitivity anaphylactoid reactions or severe excoriating rashes
should not receive penicillin or cephalosporins (10% to 15% cross-reactivity). In this subgroup of
patients, vancomycin is an alternative drug.
• In patients unable to recollect their reaction, or who developed mild rash, it is often necessary to
obtain an allergy consultation for desensitization therapy or pretreat with an antihistamine (e.g.,
diphenhydramine) prior to administration.
• In patients with methicillin-sensitive  S aureus  endocarditis, it becomes crucial to define the nature
of the allergic reaction clearly, as nafcillin has been found to be superior in the treatment of these
patients when compared with vancomycin.
Surgery
The aims of surgery are to remove infected tissue completely and to repair or replace the affected valves,
thus restoring cardiac anatomy. Indications for surgery include the following:[6] [7][91] [106] [107] [108]
• Heart failure, especially cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema (requires emergency surgery), or
poor hemodynamic tolerance (requires urgent surgery)
• Uncontrolled infection with:
• Local complications (e.g., abscess, false aneurysm, fistula, and enlarging vegetation)
• Persistent positive blood cultures (despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for more than one
week and control of septic embolic foci)
• Resistant bacteria or fungi
• Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by  S aureus  or non-HACEK gram-negative bacilli
• High risk of embolism or established embolism:
• Vegetation ≥10 mm and emboli despite appropriate antibiotic therapy
• Vegetation ≥10 mm and another reason for surgery (e.g., patients with significant valvular
dysfunction, whether a direct result of endocarditis process or not)
• Vegetation ≥10 mm and no evidence of embolus
The 2023 European Society of Cardiology guideline and the 2020 American Heart Association/American
College of Cardiology guideline recommend that the timing of surgical intervention should be decided
by the multidisciplinary endocarditis team.[7][20] [108] In addition to antibiotic therapy, early surgical
intervention will be needed in around 50% of patients.[20] One meta-analysis suggested that early
surgery, at ≤7 days or from diagnosis, affords mortality benefit in the long term.[109]
Temporary cardiac pacing is recommended in patients with atrioventricular block secondary to mycotic
abscess of the aortic root.

Infective endocarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Treatment failures often occur in patients with multiresistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus, and although these patients can present initially with a subacute course, persistent
bacteremia often leads to severe valvular abnormalities. Under these circumstances, surgical intervention
is often required to maintain stability and aid in bacteremic clearance.
Patients with perivalvular abscess, fistula, valve dehiscence, perforation, or rupture should also be closely
followed by a cardiothoracic surgical team.
Patients who have large vegetations on echocardiogram or embolic phenomenon following 2 weeks of
medical therapy are also candidates for valve surgery.
Generally, however, the decision to proceed with surgical intervention should be avoided as long
as the patient remains stable. Prolonged antimicrobial therapy prior to surgery is recommended
based on anecdotal expert opinion; however, there are currently no prospective data to support this
recommendation.
Surgical intervention in older patients is associated with lower in-hospital mortality. Moreover,
complications and mortality in older patients undergoing surgery are similar to those in younger
groups.[110] Age, therefore, should not be a contraindication to surgery where other indications for
surgery exist.
IE in pregnancy is very complex to manage; the endocarditis team should include obstetricians,
gynecologists and neonatologists when managing a pregnant patient with IE.[7][24] The indications for
surgery are the same in pregnant patients as nonpregnant patients; while there is significant risk to the
fetus, urgent surgery should not be delayed when indicated.[7][24]
The 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guideline recommends early
surgical intervention (during initial hospitalization and before completion of the full course of antibiotics)
for patients with any of the following:[20]
• Heart failure symptoms
• Left-sided IE caused by  S aureus, fungal organism, or other highly-resistant pathogen
• IE complicated by heart block, annular or aortic abscess or destructive penetrating lesions
• Persistent bacteremia or fever for >5 days despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy
Early surgery should also be considered for patients with:[20]
• Recurrent emboli and persistent vegetation
• Native left-sided valve IE with a mobile vegetation >10 mm in length
IE in the intensive care unit
Surgical intervention for IE may result in subsequent admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Additionally, patients with IE may be admitted for sepsis, heart failure, valvular dysfunction, or multiorgan
failure. Nosocomial infection is also increasing in incidence and IE may develop during a hospital or ICU
stay. The most common organisms to cause IE in the ICU are staphylococci, with streptococci being the
second most common. Also specific to ICU is the increased incidence of fungal IE, which should therefore
be considered in cases where there is a failure to respond to antibiotic therapy.

Infective endocarditis Management
Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy
Although the majority of complications of IE occur as a result of embolization, there is no evidence
that anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy reduce this risk. In fact, data suggest that patients already
on anticoagulants who develop prosthetic valve endocarditis are at higher risk of hemorrhagic
transformation.[111] One double-blind, randomized controlled trial of high-dose aspirin in all patients with
IE demonstrated no benefit of antiplatelet therapy, with an accompanying increase in bleeding risk.[112]
US guidelines recommend temporarily discontinuing anticoagulation in patients with IE who have
evidence of cerebral embolism or stroke. In patients receiving warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists at
the time of IE diagnosis, temporary discontinuation of the anticoagulation should be considered. These
guidelines state that decisions about continued anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy should ultimately
be made by the cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon, in consultation with a neurology specialist if
neurologic findings are present clinically or on imaging.[6] European guidelines indicate that antiplatelet
therapy can be continued if there is no evidence of bleeding, that oral anticoagulants should be switched
to unfractionated heparin if an ischemic stroke occurs, and that anticoagulation should be withheld
entirely if an intracranial bleed occurs.[7]
Prophylaxis
Antibiotic prophylaxis is largely reserved for patients with the highest lifetime risk of developing IE and
at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes from it.[20] [40] The American Heart Association, the
American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology list the following high-risk
features:[6] [7][20]
• Prosthetic cardiac valves, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homografts
• Prosthetic material used for valve repair, such as annuloplasty rings, chords, or clips
• Previous IE
• Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease with residual
shunts or valvular regurgitation at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or
prosthetic device
• Cardiac transplant with valve regurgitation due to a structurally abnormal valve
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in high-risk patients undergoing dental procedures that involve
manipulation of gingival tissues or the periapical region of the tooth, or perforation of the oral mucosa:[20]
[40]
• The most common cause of IE following dental procedures is  Streptococcus viridans  (alpha-
hemolytic streptococci). Antibiotics for prophylaxis are; therefore, directed toward this organism,
and administered as a single dose 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure
Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in high-risk patients for the following dental procedures:
• Anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue
• Taking dental radiographs
• Placement of removable prosthodontic or orthodontic appliances
• Adjustment of orthodontic appliances
• Placement of orthodontic brackets
• Shedding of primary teeth
• Bleeding from trauma to the lips or oral mucosa[20]

»   S aureus  is the most common cause of
endocarditis in the intravenous drug-abusing
population.[3]
» In intravenous drug users with right-sided
endocarditis, gentamicin has been shown to
increase the rate of microbial killing when used
in combination with a beta-lactam. However,
aminoglycosides are no longer recommended
in this situation due to the increased risk of
nephrotoxicity.[96] [97] The American Heart
Association recommends that intravenous drug
users with IE should be offered 6 weeks of
intravenous antibiotics. If this is not deemed
achievable (e.g., patient decision or unplanned
discharge) initial intravenous therapy should be
followed up by appropriate oral treatment, with
outpatient follow-up by addiction medicine and
infectious disease specialists.[3]

Daily dose may be given once daily
(preferred) or in 2-3 equally divided doses.
Gentamicin dose should be adjusted to
achieve a peak serum concentration of
3-4 micrograms/mL and a trough serum
concentration of <1 microgram/mL when
given in 3 divided doses. There are no data
on optimal drug concentrations when once-
daily dosing is used.
» The treatment of enterococcal endocarditis,
similar to that of viridans group streptococci,
is based on the sensitivities to penicillin.
Enterococci, unlike the viridans group
streptococci, are not usually killed by
antimicrobials, but merely inhibited. Enterococci
species are inherently impermeable to
aminoglycoside medications, but when
aminoglycosides are used in combination with
penicillin, bactericidal concentrations can be
reached.
» Intrinsic penicillin resistance is uncommon
in  Enterococcus faecalis  but is common in 
Enterococcus faecium . These patients should
be treated with vancomycin plus gentamicin.[6]
» Close monitoring of renal function and possible
ototoxicity is important in patients receiving
extended treatment with aminoglycosides.[6]

Infective endocarditis Management
Acute
» Increasingly, the  Haemophilus  species, 
Aggregatibacter ,  Cardiobacterium hominis , 
Eikenella corrodens , and  Kingella  species
(HACEK) organisms have become ampicillin-
resistant, and ampicillin should never be used
as first-line therapy for HACEK-organism
endocarditis.
» These strains are susceptible to third-
and fourth-generation cephalosporins (e.g.,
ceftriaxone) and possibly ampicillin/sulbactam.
Treatment course is 4 weeks.[6]
» These strains are also susceptible to
fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones have not
been extensively studied in the treatment of
IE, and therefore should be used only as an
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate
cephalosporins or ampicillin/sulbactam.[6]
» Systemic fluoroquinolone antibiotics may
cause serious, disabling, and potentially long-
lasting or irreversible adverse events. This
includes, but is not limited to: tendinopathy/
tendon rupture; peripheral neuropathy;
arthropathy/arthralgia; aortic aneurysm
and dissection; heart valve regurgitation;
dysglycemia; and central nervous system effects
including seizures, depression, psychosis, and
suicidal thoughts and behavior.[100] Prescribing
restrictions apply to the use of fluoroquinolones,
and these restrictions may vary between
countries. In general, fluoroquinolones should
be restricted for use in serious, life-threatening
bacterial infections only. Some regulatory
agencies may also recommend that they
must only be used in situations where other
antibiotics, that are commonly recommended
for the infection, are inappropriate (e.g.,
resistance, contraindications, treatment failure,
unavailability). Consult your local guidelines and
drug information source for more information on
suitability, contraindications, and precautions.
» Ampicillin is an option if the growth of the
isolate is sufficient to permit in vitro susceptibility
results.[6]
» Ampicillin/sulbactam plus gentamicin for 4-6
weeks may be recommended in some countries.

» Close monitoring of renal function and possible
ototoxicity is important in patients receiving

given in divided doses every 12 hours for 6
weeks
Vancomycin dose should be adjusted to
achieve a trough concentration of 10-20
micrograms/mL.
-and-
» gentamicin: 3 mg/kg/day intravenously/
intramuscularly given in divided doses every
8 hours for 6 weeks
Daily dose may be given once daily
(preferred) or in 2-3 equally divided doses.
Gentamicin dose should be adjusted to
achieve a peak serum concentration of
3-4 micrograms/mL and a trough serum
concentration of <1 microgram/mL when
given in 3 divided doses. There are no data
on optimal drug concentrations when once-
daily dosing is used.
» The treatment of enterococcal endocarditis,
similar to that of viridans group streptococci,
is based on the sensitivities to penicillin.
Enterococci, unlike the viridans group
streptococci, are not usually killed by
antimicrobials, but merely inhibited. Enterococci
species are inherently impermeable to
aminoglycoside medications, but when
aminoglycosides are used in combination with
penicillin, bactericidal concentrations can be
reached.
» Intrinsic penicillin resistance is uncommon
in  Enterococcus faecalis  but is common in 
Enterococcus faecium . These patients should
be treated with vancomycin plus gentamicin.[6]
» Close monitoring of renal function and possible
ototoxicity is important in patients receiving
extended treatment with aminoglycosides.[6]

Infective endocarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Emerging
Multidrug resistance
Multidrug resistance is an increasing problem and has a significant impact on the outcomes of patients
with IE. More research is necessary to define appropriate treatments for resistant  Staphylococcus aureus 
infections, as well as  Streptococcus pneumoniae  and vancomycin-resistant strains of  Enterococcus
faecium .
Dalbavancin
Dalbavancin is a long-acting lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that demonstrates strong activity against multidrug
resistant gram-positive bacteria. Although it is currently only approved for acute bacterial skin and skin
structure infections, it has shown promise in the treatment of IE.[127] [128]
Tigecycline
Potential therapy for multidrug-resistant enterococci; however, there are minimal published data on its clinical
use.[6]
AngioVac®
AngioVac® is a percutaneous vacuum based device most commonly used to aspirate thrombi in the right
heart chambers and the pulmonary vasculature. This device has been used for debulking of right-sided IE.
More study is needed to establish efficacy and safety of this device in IE.[129]
Primary prevention
The evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis preventing infection following dental procedures and instrumentation
of the respiratory, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal tract is weak.[51] An increase in incidence of IE in
recent years has not been found to be temporally related to changes in recommendations regarding use
of prophylactic antibiotics.[51] [52] [53][54] Conflicting data suggest that a reduction in bacteremia may not
result in a lower incidence of IE in low-risk individuals.[55] The risk of bacteremia resulting from interventions
such as dental procedures and instrumentation of the respiratory, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal tract is
significantly smaller than from usual lifetime activities such as toothbrushing or chewing.[51] [56] Data have
indicated that even if treatment with prophylactic antibiotics were 100% effective, only a small number of
cases would be prevented. Indeed, the risk of fatalities from anaphylaxis resulting from antibiotic prophylaxis
is higher than the benefit of preventing endocarditis.
There is consensus that antibiotic prophylaxis should therefore be largely reserved for patients at the highest
risk of developing endocarditis and at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes from it.[20] [40][57] [58]
[59] Decisions about antibiotic prophylaxis should only be made after careful evaluation of the individual
patient’s circumstances, following discussion with the patient, taking into account the patient’s values and
preferences, and using your clinical judgement.[57] [58][60]
The American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) list the following high-risk features:[6] [7][20]
• Prosthetic cardiac valves, including transcatheter-implanted prostheses and homografts
• Prosthetic material used for valve repair, such as annuloplasty rings, chords, or clips
• Previous IE
• Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease or repaired congenital heart disease with residual shunts
or valvular regurgitation at the site of or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device
• Cardiac transplant recipients
• Ventricular assist devices

Infective endocarditis Management
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in these highest-risk patients when undertaking dental procedures
that involve manipulation of gingival tissues or the periapical region of the tooth, or perforation of the oral
mucosa.[20] [40]
The most common cause of IE following dental procedures is  Streptococcus viridans  (alpha-hemolytic
streptococci). Antibiotics for prophylaxis are, therefore, directed toward this organism, and administered as
a single dose 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure. Guidelines recommend oral amoxicillin. If the patient
is allergic to penicillin, alternative options are: first- or second-generation oral cephalosporin, azithromycin
or clarithromycin, doxycycline. If the patient is unable to take oral medication, alternative options are:
intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone.[40]
Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in high-risk patients for the following dental procedures: anesthetic
injections through noninfected tissue, taking dental radiographs, placement of removable prosthodontic or
orthodontic appliances, adjustment of orthodontic appliances, placement of orthodontic brackets, shedding of
primary teeth, and bleeding from trauma to the lips or oral mucosa.[40] 
Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in high-risk patients undergoing nondental procedures (e.g.,
transthoracic echocardiogram, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, or cystoscopy) in the absence of
active infection.[20] [40]
Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in patients with moderate-risk lesions.[20] [40]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of infective endocarditis taken
from the ACC/AHA guidance on valvular heart disease.[20]
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.
Patients with valvular heart disease at high risk of IE
Prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair; history of previous
IE; congenital heart disease; cardiac transplant recipients
All
Intervention Goal
Maintain optimal oral health
Regular professional dental care is recommended
(twice a year routine visits where available).
Advise use of appropriate dental products (e.g.,
manual, powered, and ultrasonic toothbrushes;
dental floss; other plaque-removal devices).
Reduce potential sources of bacterial seeding
Undergoing dental procedure involving manipulation of gingival tissues or the periapical
region of the tooth, or perforation of the oral mucosa
Intervention Goal
Prophylactic antibiotics
Antibiotic prophylaxis is reasonable in this subset of
patients at highest risk of IE.
Reduce risk of IE by reducing bacteremia
There is a high risk of morbidity and mortality if the
patient develops IE, therefore prevention is very
important in this group.

including Streptococcus viridans, as well as
reducing costs and individual patient complications
such as Clostridioides difficile-associated disease,
anaphylaxis, and drug toxicity.
Undergoing nondental procedure (e.g., transesophageal echocardiogram,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, lithotripsy); with active infection
Intervention Goal
Antibiotics to treat active infection
Antibiotics are only recommended for nondental
procedures if there is active infection present.
In patients with bacteriuria, give appropriate
antimicrobial therapy before elective surgery,
instrumentation, or diagnostic procedures that
involve the genitourinary tract.
Reduce potential sources of bacterial seeding
Undergoing nondental procedure; without active infection
Intervention Goal
No prophylactic antibiotics required
The risk of IE after most procedures is low and
there are no controlled data supporting the use
of antibiotic prophylaxis in the absence of active
infection.
Transient bacteremia due to endoscopy is infrequent
(rate 2% to 5%), and typically the organisms
identified are unlikely to cause IE. Biopsy,
polypectomy, or sphincterotomy have not been
shown to increase the risk of bacteremia. Even
for procedures associated with higher rates of
bacteremia (e.g., esophageal dilation, endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography), no studies
have demonstrated a reduction in IE with antibiotic
prophylaxis.
Reduce antibiotic resistance, decrease risk of
Clostridioides difficile  -associated disease
Antibiotic stewardship reduces development of drug
resistance, as well as reducing costs and individual
patient complications such as Clostridioides difficile-
associated disease, anaphylaxis, and drug toxicity.

Infective endocarditis Management
All
Intervention Goal
Maintain optimal oral health
Regular professional dental care is recommended
(twice a year routine visits where available).
Use of appropriate dental products (e.g., manual,
powered, and ultrasonic toothbrushes; dental floss;
other plaque-removal devices).
Reduce potential sources of bacterial seeding
Secondary prevention
Patients with a previous history of IE are at high risk of a further episode of endocarditis. These patients
should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissues or the
periapical region of the tooth, or perforation of the oral mucosa.[20] [40]
IE may signify occult malignancy. The relationship between  Streptococcus gallolyticus  (formerly 
Streptococcus bovis ) infection and colon cancer is well documented. Exclusion of occult colon cancer is
recommended in cases of IE secondary to infection with these organisms. Annual colonoscopy is strongly
suggested for those individuals where no tumor is detected.[144]
There has been an increase in the number of individuals affected by congenital heart disease and the
incidence of IE in this group is reported as being 15 to 140 times higher than that of the general population,
although the prognosis remains better than in other forms of IE.[145] [146] Primary prevention in those with
congenital heart disease is paramount, and patient education regarding oral, dental, and skin hygiene, and
the avoidance of tattoos and piercings remains crucial.[145] [146]
Patient discussions
Patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use should be referred promptly to an addiction
treatment program.[3] Patients should also be advised to practice good oral and dental hygiene and visit
their dentist regularly; avoid body piercing or tattooing; and to wash their hands regularly.
In addition, all patients should be educated regarding the signs and symptoms of IE, as, if there is a
recurrence, early treatment may prevent long-term complications.

Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients should be monitored for persistent infection, defined as persistent fever and positive blood
cultures after 7 days of appropriate antibiotics.[7] Blood cultures should be repeated after 48-72 hours
after commencing appropriate antibiotics; persistent positive blood cultures are associated with an
increased risk of in-hospital mortality.[7] Before completing antimicrobial therapy, patients should receive
transthoracic echocardiogram to establish a new baseline. In addition, it is generally recommended that
patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis undergo transesophageal echocardiogram at the completion of
therapy. All patients should have blood cultures done at 1 and 2 weeks following therapy to ensure they
are not persistently bacteremic.[6]

Infective endocarditis Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
congestive heart failure (CHF) short term high
Patients who develop fulminant CHF from valvular dysfunction require immediate evaluation by
cardiovascular surgery. Several studies have demonstrated that CHF is the single greatest impact on
prognosis.[132] Despite a higher operative mortality rate, patients with CHF who undergo operative
intervention have a markedly reduced mortality compared with patients who have medical therapy
alone.[131]
As populations age, IE is becoming more frequent in those aged over 70 years, with trends toward
worsening outcomes.[61] [133] Mortality of older patients with IE is higher than that of younger patients:
age, cerebral embolism, and prosthetic valve endocarditis have been shown to be risk factors for the
increased mortality.[110]
systemic embolization short term high
Systemic embolization occurs in 22% to 50% of cases.[7][134] There is a significant increase in the risk of
embolization if the vegetation is >10 mm.[6] [135] Other risk factors for embolization include intravenous
drug use,  Staphylococcus aureus  infection and mitral valve vegetation.[136] Emboli often involve the
lungs, spleen, joints, brain, and coronary arteries. Up to 65% involve the central nervous system, the
majority of which involve the middle cerebral artery distribution presenting as facial droop, unilateral
hemiparesis, and aphasia or neglect, depending on dominance. The indication for valvular surgery for
prevention of systemic emboli have traditionally been >2 prior major embolic events.[137] There has
been much debate regarding whether patients with IE require anticoagulation. Given the underlying
pathophysiology of endothelial damage, platelet aggregation and superimposed thrombus, it seems
intuitive that anticoagulation may prevent systemic emboli; however, several studies have not been able to
demonstrate this benefit and, in fact, have found a trend toward increased bleeding in patients treated with
aspirin.[138] [139] [140]
acute kidney injury (AKI) short term high
AKI occurs in up to 30% of patients with IE. In this context, AKI may be caused by: immune complex and
vasculitic glomerulonephritis; renal infarction, which is usually due to septic emboli and may occur at
any time during the course of IE; hemodynamic instability in a patient with heart failure or sepsis or after
cardiac surgery; antibiotic toxicity (acute interstitial nephritis), particularly if the patient is being treated
with aminoglycosides, vancomycin (which has synergistic toxicity when given with aminoglycosides), or
high-dose penicillin; nephrotoxicity due to contrast agents used for imaging purposes. Renal replacement
therapy may be required if the patient has severe AKI. Mild AKI is usually reversible.
To mitigate against the risk of AKI, adjust antibiotic doses according to creatinine clearance and monitor
serum antibiotic levels carefully.[7] If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, or has previously had AKI,
avoid imaging with nephrotoxic contrast agents if possible.
anterior mitral valve vegetation >10 mm short term medium
The role of surgical intervention to prevent systemic emboli is controversial and should be targeted to
each individual patient. Surgical intervention yields the greatest benefit during the early phase of IE when
embolic rates are highest.[141]

Infective endocarditis Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
valvular dehiscence, rupture, or fistula short term medium
Valvular dehiscence or fistulization occurs most commonly in patients with prosthetic valve involvement or
in those with invasive  Staphylococcus aureus  infection. It is recommended that these patients have early
surgical intervention to prevent onset of acute congestive heart failure.[6]
splenic abscess short term low
This is a rare complication of IE. It occurs via bacterial seeding of a bland splenic infarct or direct septic
emboli to splenic arteries. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans are the best
diagnostic tools. Definitive therapy is splenectomy but percutaneous drainage can be performed in
patients who are poor surgical candidates.
mycotic aneurysms short term low
These are also rare complications of IE and result from septic embolization to the arterial vasa vasorum
with subsequent spread of the infection through the intima and outward through the vessel wall. They most
commonly occur in the intracranial arteries.[142] Patients may present with nonspecific findings or focal
neurologic deficits. Some aneurysms may rupture and produce intracerebral hemorrhage or meningeal
irritation. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are 90% to 95% specific for
detecting intracranial mycotic aneurysms, but the diagnostic standard remains cerebral angiography.[143]
Prognosis
There are no comprehensive studies that have looked at overall prognosis in patients with IE. Left-sided IE
tends to have a poorer prognosis, with higher morbidity and mortality than right-sided IE.[6] [7] Congestive
heart failure remains the single greatest predictor of prognosis in patients, regardless of the offending
microorganism. Other indicators of mortality include cerebral complications, vegetation length >10 mm,
moderate to severe heart failure, bacterial etiology other than  Viridans streptococci  and failure to undertake
surgery when indicated.[20] [130] Surgery, if indicated, has been associated with a lower overall mortality;
however, patients with definitive indications for surgery tend to be critically ill and carry a high intraoperative
mortality rate.[20] [131]
As the population ages, IE is becoming more frequently seen, with trends towards worsening outcomes.[61]
 Mortality of IE in elderly patients is higher than in younger patients: age, cerebral embolism, and prosthetic
valve endocarditis have been shown to be risk factors for the increased mortality.

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
