Focal atrial tachycardia Overview
Summary
Focal atrial tachycardia occurs in the settings of structurally normal heart, coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, cardiac surgery, catecholamine ingestion, digoxin toxicity, and alcohol dependency.
Symptoms and signs include palpitations, fatigue, presyncope/syncope, chest pain, and dyspnea.
ECG shows a regular atrial tachycardia with P-wave morphology different from that in sinus tachycardia.
A trial of adenosine can help differentiate focal AT from other supraventricular tachycardias.
Initial therapy should be guided by cause, comorbid conditions, hemodynamic status, and patient preference.
First-line options for hemodynamically stable patients include intravenous beta-blockers or calcium-channel
blockers, or catheter ablation.
For sustained focal atrial tachycardia, cardiology consultation, class Ic or III antiarrhythmic agents, and
ablative therapy are appropriate.
Definition
Focal atrial tachycardia (focal AT) is characterized as a rapid regular rhythm arising from a discrete area
within the atria. It occurs in a wide range of clinical conditions, including catecholamine excess, digoxin
toxicity, congenital heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Focal AT is often confused with other regular
supraventricular tachycardias, specifically re-entrant tachycardias, sinus tachycardia, and atrial flutter. It may
be difficult to diagnose by ECG alone. The diagnosis of focal AT is usually based on ECG, clinical history,
and response to interventions such as vagal maneuvers and adenosine.

Focal atrial tachycardia Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Focal atrial tachycardia is a relatively uncommon arrhythmia that occurs in all age groups and represents
approximately 3% to 17% of the patients referred for supraventricular tachycardia ablation.[1] There is
no pattern in relation to sex or ancestry. Of the supraventricular tachycardias observed in children, atrial
tachycardia accounts for 10% to 23% in children with normal hearts. Prevalence is higher among patients
with congenital heart disease or a history of cardiac surgery.[2] [3]
Etiology
Focal atrial tachycardia (focal AT) has a variety of causes. It may occur in healthy people, although often
there is underlying cardiac pathology.[1] [4] [5] Associated conditions include cardiomyopathies, ischemic
heart disease, previous cardiac surgery, cardiac ablation, and hyperthyroidism.
People without cardiac pathology may develop this rhythm in the setting of exogenous stimulants such as
amphetamines, cocaine, and acute alcohol intoxication. Focal AT is the classic presenting rhythm in patients
with digoxin toxicity and is typically associated with AV nodal block.

Focal atrial tachycardia Theory
THEORY
Pathophysiology
Atrial tachycardia is the least common and often the most challenging of the regular supraventricular
tachycardias. It may arise from either atria or from structures contiguous with the atria, such as the
pulmonary veins and superior vena cava. The anatomy of the atrium and surrounding structures serve as
a substrate for arrhythmia initiation and propagation. Electrophysiological testing has shown that there are
three possible mechanisms: abnormal automaticity of nonsinus atrial tissue, triggered automaticity due to
delay after depolarization, and micro-re-entry within the atria. Re-entrant circuits are dependent on areas of
differential conduction and recovery and the presence of anatomic boundaries. Vulnerable atrial tissue due to
scarring, disease, or medications can give rise to paroxysmal atrial tachycardias sustained by the bordering
mitral and tricuspid annuli, orifices of the vena cava, pulmonary veins, and coronary sinus. Atrial tissues,
such as the crista terminalis and pulmonary veins, are common sites for automaticity or triggered activity.
The 12-lead ECG rarely provides clues to the cause. These are usually distinguished in the laboratory setting
and rarely clinically.
In healthy people, the most likely cause is enhanced automaticity from a single focus in the atrium. It is
usually seen in the setting of catecholamine excess, exacerbations of chronic lung disease, acute alcohol
ingestion, and electrolyte imbalances. This rhythm tends to accelerate to its maximal rate and does not start
with a premature atrial contraction. It typically shows beat-to-beat variability during warm-up and decelerates
gradually. The contour of the P wave differs from the sinus P wave, with heart rates usually <200 bpm.
Automatic atrial tachycardia tends to be incessant, particularly in children.
Re-entry is probably the underlying mechanism in people with diseased atrial tissue or those who have
undergone cardiac surgery or ablation involving the atria. The arrhythmia circumnavigates the surgical scar,
forming separate functional or anatomic limbs of the tachycardia. Slow conduction and unidirectional block
induced by a premature beat completes the re-entrant circuit. A premature atrial beat starts the tachycardia
loop, and alternations in the re-entrant circuit conduction can abruptly terminate the tachycardia, imparting it
a paroxysmal nature.
Atrial tachycardias due to triggered activity are usually seen in patients with a known cardiomyopathy taking
digoxin. These rhythms tend to be prolonged and are difficult to treat. They are also characterized by a warm-
up period at onset and a cool-down period at termination rather than the abrupt nature of re-entrant loops.
Atrial tachycardias due to digoxin toxicity typically involve AV block.
Classification
Atrial tachycardias[1]
• Sinus tachycardia: regular tachycardia with uniform P wave before every QRS. Rate shows gradual
variation in response to sympathetic/parasympathetic stimulation.
• Focal atrial tachycardia: recurrent, regular tachycardia with a fixed heart rate at 100 to 250 bpm. P
waves are visible before every QRS, and are uniform in their appearance when looking at a single
lead. Onset and termination of arrhythmia are abrupt.
• AV node re-entrant tachycardia: regular tachycardia with a fixed rate in the range of 140 to 280 bpm. P
waves may be visible, but usually follow the QRS complex with a short R-P interval.
• Multifocal atrial tachycardia: irregular tachycardia at a rate of 120 to 200 bpm. P waves occur before
every QRS, and there are at least three different P-wave morphologies when looking at a single lead.

Focal atrial tachycardia Theory
• Atrial flutter: new-onset atrial flutter usually has a fixed heart rate of 145 to 150 bpm due to 2:1 AV
block and an atrial flutter rate of 300 bpm. When medicated with AV node-blocking agents, the heart
rate may be irregular, indicating variable AV block.
• Atrial fibrillation: irregular tachycardia with beat-to-beat variation in heart rate, P waves replaced by
fibrillatory waves.
Case history
Case history #1
An 88-year-old woman with history of dilated cardiomyopathy presents with nausea, lightheadedness, and
a racing heart. She is taking digoxin and recently her diuretic dosage has been increased. On exam she
is alert but weak. Her BP is 108/88 mmHg, and pulse 88 bpm and regular. The lungs are clear. An ECG
shows a sustained atrial tachycardia at 180 bpm with 2:1 AV block. Serum potassium is 2.8 mEq/L.

Other presentations
Presentations of focal atrial tachycardia are highly variable, ranging from nonspecific complaints of
fatigue and light headedness to congestive heart failure and syncope. Brief episodes of tachycardia
may elicit complaints of chest fluttering or palpitations. Sustained runs of tachycardia will probably have
more marked presentations, such as ischemia in patients with underlying coronary artery disease,
and congestive heart failure and syncope in patients with preexisting cardiomyopathy. Sustained atrial
tachycardias can also precipitate cardiomyopathy, particularly in children.

Focal atrial tachycardia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Diagnosis is based on history, the 12-lead ECG, and exclusion of alternative tachyarrhythmic diagnoses
through observation of response to maneuvers. However, inspection of the ECG does not usually reveal the
underlying cause.[8] [9]

QRS tachycardias. AV = atrioventricular, PAC = premature atrial contraction
From the collection of Sarah Stahmer, MD
History/physical
Patients may have a history of prior cardiac disease, COPD, or asthma.[10] Drug history may identify
use of digoxin, aminophylline, beta-agonists, potassium-wasting diuretics, over-the-counter cold or sinus
medications, or substance abuse. A history of recent atrial fibrillation ablation or prior cardiac surgery
may be present.[11] There may be symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting,
lightheadedness, syncope, palpitations, or fatigue or weakness. Physical exam may detect rales or edema
if congestive heart failure is present.
ECG/Telemetry
The atrial rate in focal atrial tachycardia (focal AT) is typically between 100 and 250 bpm. There is
typically a warm-up of the rate for the initial few beats. Often the arrhythmia will occur in short bursts with
abrupt onset and cessation.
The ECG should show atrial P waves, and their morphology should be different from the P waves in
sinus rhythm. There is typically an isoelectric segment between P waves. At times, irregularity is seen,
especially at onset (warm-up) and termination (warm-down).

Focal atrial tachycardia Diagnosis
The PR interval is typically >0.12 seconds (120 milliseconds). The morphology of the P wave in leads aVL
and V1 may provide clues about the site of origin. A positive P wave in lead V1 carries 93% sensitivity and
88% specificity for a left atrial focus. In contrast, a positive or biphasic P wave in aVL predicts a right atrial
focus with 88% sensitivity and 79% specificity.[12]
Focal atrial tachycardia in a 55-year-old with ischemic cardiomyopathy
From the collection of Sarah Stahmer, MD
If the atrial rate is not excessively fast, each P wave will be conducted to the ventricle. If the rate is
excessive, or there is AV nodal disease or suppression due to medications, Wenckebach or Mobitz type I
second-degree heart block may be seen. In digoxin toxicity, in addition to atrial tachycardia and AV nodal
block, there are often signs of abnormal automaticity of nonatrial tissues, such as junctional or ventricular
ectopy.
An ambulatory 24-hour (Holter) or longer ECG recording (wearable or implantable loop recorder) may be
helpful for diagnosis and management in patients with focal AT that occurs sporadically.[1]
Hypokalemia alone can predispose nonsinus atrial tissue to spontaneously depolarize, particularly in
patients using digoxin.
Vagal maneuvers or adenosine
An incessant tachycardia that does not show normal variation to pain, respirations, and changes in
sympathetic/parasympathetic tone typical of a sinus-based tachycardia indicates a nonsinus origin.
Vagal maneuvers will either have no effect or create an AV nodal block. The nodal block slows the
ventricular response rate but has no effect on the atrial rate. Adenosine causes AV node blockade and
may transiently suppress, or more rarely terminate, the tachycardia.[13] [14]
Vagal maneuvers or adenosine may help differentiate atrial tachycardia from other causes of
supraventricular tachycardia, however this information can be misleading or limited if the tachycardia
terminates.

Focal atrial tachycardia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Response to adenosine 6 mg intravenously
From the collection of Sarah Stahmer, MD
The differential diagnosis of atrial tachycardia will often include sinus tachycardia, AV node re-entrant
tachycardia, AV re-entrant tachycardia or atrial flutter.
• Sinus tachycardia will transiently slow in response, with slowing of the sinus rate and prolongation
of the PR interval before AV block (if it occurs).
• AV node re-entrant tachycardia or AV re-entrant tachycardia (accessory pathway mediated
supraventricular tachycardia) will abruptly cease, with resumption of sinus rhythm after a pause.
• In atrial flutter there will be transient slowing of the ventricular response rate with AV block. The
characteristic flutter waves will be revealed and will be unaffected.
This is not a foolproof therapeutic intervention, as some atrial tachycardias, particularly those due to micro
re-entry, will break in response to these maneuvers. Most will show no response or show transient AV
block with persistent atrial depolarization (P waves).

Further tests
Serum analysis should follow clinical suspicion of etiology. Electrolytes should be routine. Levels of
medications that can predispose patients to these rhythms can be ordered when appropriate, specifically
theophylline and digoxin. When drugs of abuse are suspected, specifically cocaine, amphetamines, and
ethanol, quantitative supportive data can be valuable. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level helps rule
out suspected hyperthyroidism.
Echocardiography can be helpful in patients for whom the underlying cause is suspected to be due to
previously undiagnosed cardiac pathology, such as valvular disease and cardiomyopathies. Patients
with evidence of hemodynamic compromise or heart failure should have an echo performed as soon as
possible.
Electrophysiologic study (EPS) is an invasive test that can assist in confirming the origin and site of
arrhythmogenesis for selected patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear or who are not responding to
empiric therapies. It can be curative if coupled with ablation.[1]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
cardiac disease (common)
• Previous myocardial infarction, cardiac or great vessel surgery, congenital heart disease, or
cardiomyopathy predisposes to focal atrial tachycardia.
Other diagnostic factors
medications (common)
• Include aminophylline, beta-agonists, potassium-wasting diuretics, or over-the-counter cold/sinus
medications that contain phenylephrine.
palpitations (common)
• The beating of the heart becomes clinically manifest when the rate is discordant with clinical context--
for example, a heart rate of 160 bpm while lying in bed.
fatigue, weakness (common)
• Result from poor cardiac output and decreased exercise tolerance.
chest pain (uncommon)
• Chest pressure, pain, or dyspnea suggests an acute coronary syndrome, which may be a precipitating
event or a result of the tachyarrhythmia.
shortness of breath, cough (uncommon)
• Indicate worsening of baseline COPD or congestive heart failure, which may precipitate the
arrhythmia.
• Other symptoms include fever, sputum, wheezing, nocturnal cough, orthopnea, and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.

• Given the rarity of focal atrial tachycardia (focal AT), its multiple mechanisms, and disease
associations, much of the data linking this arrhythmia to a cause are observational.
exacerbation of chronic lung disease
• A variety of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias have been associated with acute respiratory illnesses,
the most common being multifocal atrial tachycardia.
• Focal AT is less common, but the underlying mechanisms of enhanced automaticity are the same:
hypoxia, administration of medications such as methylxanthines and beta-agonists, and electrolyte
disturbances.
theophylline
• Theophylline increases atrial automaticity, which can predispose to supraventricular tachycardia,
including atrial tachycardia.[6]

rhythm or sinus tachycardia.
Criteria
ECG
Focal atrial tachycardia (focal AT) is usually a regular tachycardia with an atrial rate typically between 100
and 250 bpm. The ECG must show atrial P waves, and their morphology should be different from the P
waves in sinus rhythm. There is typically an isoelectric segment between P waves. At times, irregularity is
seen, especially at onset (warm-up) and termination (warm-down).

Focal atrial tachycardia Management
Approach
The response to any given therapy is dependent on the underlying mechanism of the arrhythmia. Focal
atrial tachycardias due to triggered activity may be terminated by adenosine or overdrive pacing, but the
response to beta blockers or calcium channel blockers may be variable. Arrhythmias caused by enhanced
automaticity often convert spontaneously on withdrawal of the offending agent. They can be transiently
suppressed by adenosine or by overdrive pacing and may be terminated by beta blockers or calcium
channel blockers. Persistent arrhythmias of this type are often resistant to pace termination, electrical
cardioversion, and pharmacologic therapy, and they ultimately require catheter ablation. A micro-re-entrant
atrial tachycardia response to adenosine, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers may be variable. Re-
entrant arrhythmias may require direct current (DC) cardioversion and, possibly, use of antiarrhythmic drugs.
Electrophysiologic study involving ablation can be curative and may be offered as first-line therapy to select
patients.[1]
The mechanisms of focal atrial tachycardia (focal AT) are difficult to distinguish clinically. There is no clear
hierarchy of therapies. The presence of an underlying cause, comorbid conditions, hemodynamic status, and
patient preference can be used to guide initial therapy.[16]
Differentiating the type of arrhythmia
Adenosine causes AV node blockade with slowing of the ventricular response rate or cessation
of the atrial tachycardia, and can be helpful in differentiating focal AT from other supraventricular
tachycardias.[13] Effects are usually transient. If the focal AT terminates with adenosine then the
information provided may be misleading or limited. For example, when attempting to differentiate
atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia/atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia from focal AT,
adenosine may cause transient AV block with persistent atrial tachycardia, supporting the diagnosis of
focal AT. The response to adenosine may also assist in identifying the atrial tachycardia mechanism.
Focal AT due to triggered activity may terminate with adenosine, in contrast with re-entrant atrial
tachycardias, which usually do not.[1][14] [15]
The telemetry strip during administration should be carefully inspected for placement of P waves at the
time the rhythm breaks. A very short RP interval with a final P wave suggests a re-entrant supraventricular
tachycardia.
Transient slowing of the ventricular response rate with sustained atrial activity indicates flutter or focal
AT. Flutter will have the characteristic saw tooth pattern of an atrial macro-re-entrant circuit. Focal AT will
show discrete P waves with an isoelectric baseline.
Lack of response to adenosine suggests either sinus tachycardia or focal AT, and strongly suggests that
the rhythm is not re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter.
Some forms of atrial tachycardia will break in response to adenosine.[17]

General principles for treating patients with focal AT
Patients are usually symptomatic due to the increased heart rate, which is uncomfortable but also may
exacerbate underlying conditions, such as coronary artery disease or valvular heart disease. Treatment
efforts should focus on ensuring hemodynamic stability and treating complications of the rhythm such as
congestive heart failure, which usually require slowing the heart rate. This may be difficult in some cases,
and interventions should be chosen with careful consideration of the clinical context.
The clinical context is often the primary clue to the underlying mechanism. For example, focal AT in the
context of acute alcohol intoxication is probably because of enhanced automaticity. These often convert
spontaneously once the offending agent (alcohol, cocaine, or amphetamines) is withdrawn. Those that

do not resolve spontaneously are often resistant to pace termination (which produces, at best, only a
transient suppression of the arrhythmia), electrical cardioversion, and pharmacologic therapy. Catheter
ablation is often the only effective treatment.
If there is a history of known cardiac defect or prior cardiac surgery, the focal AT may be due to re-entry.
Re-entry arrhythmias are amenable to pace termination, cardioversion, ablation, and pharmacologic
intervention. Of interest is the fact that repair of cardiac defects may reduce the incidence of focal AT.[18]
Triggered arrhythmias are difficult to distinguish clinically. They are known to behave in a fashion
somewhere in between that of automatic and re-entrant arrhythmias and are therefore more amenable to
pharmacologic intervention.
Digoxin toxicity
Digoxin toxicity should be suspected if there is a history of congestive heart failure, the patient is taking
digoxin, and the rhythm is atrial tachycardia with evidence of atrioventricular blockade.
Initial work-up should focus on determining whether the patient is hemodynamically compromised from
the rhythm itself and, if so, considering digoxin immune antibody fragments (Fab) therapy if the patient is
found to be digoxin toxic. The treatment is supportive care while repleting potassium and/or withholding
digoxin.

its beta-blocking effects, but better tolerated than beta-blockers in patients with impaired left ventricular
function. Ibutilide has been reported to be effective in some cases of focal AT, but its mechanism of
action is not clear.[1] [15] EPS involving ablation can be curative and may be offered as first-line therapy
to select patients who prefer to avoid long-term pharmacologic therapy e.g., younger patients or those
with certain occupations, such as pilots.[1] Catecholamine excess is largely suspected by a history of
medication use, cocaine, amphetamines, or alcohol withdrawal with clinical features of catecholamine
excess on examination (agitation, diaphoresis, hypertension). 
Focal AT can be caused by sudden surges in circulating catecholamines through use of amphetamines,
cocaine, or products containing catecholamines. Patients are rarely hemodynamically compromised, and
treatment should be supportive. Those who do not respond to supportive measures, do not have a history
of cocaine use, and are hemodynamically unstable may be treated with beta-blockers. Those who are still
refractory may be treated with direct current (DC) cardioversion.
Patients who are hemodyamically compromised or have drug-resistant rhythms are candidates for
synchronized cardioversion.[15] The response to cardioversion is dependent in part on the underlying
mechanism of the tachycardia. Micro-re-entrant tachycardias are likely to readily convert to sinus rhythm,
triggered focal AT will have a variable response, and cardioversion is not likely to be effective in focal AT
with an automatic mechanism.
Approach to sustained, refractory or recurrent focal AT
Management of focal AT beyond the initial stabilization period and for those refractory to initial
interventions may benefit from additional pharmacologic therapy, which should be done in consultation
with a cardiologist. Class Ic antiarrhythmics are first choice and class III antiarrhythmics second choice.
Many patients with sustained and/or recurrent atrial tachycardias are referred for catheter ablative therapy.
The success of this treatment depends on the site of origin and underlying mechanism.[1]
Children
Pediatric atrial tachycardias are uncommon. Atrial tachycardia in children is often incessant and
refractory to typical treatments used for atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia; tachycardia-induced
cardiomyopathy is commonly observed. The cause is usually idiopathic but identified risk factors include
viral infections, atrial tumors, and surgery for congenital heart disease.
The treatment of pediatric patients with atrial tachycardia includes medications to suppress the arrhythmia
and/or control the ventricular response and catheter ablation. Beta-blockers, digoxin, and antiarrhythmics
are often effective as first-line pharmacologic interventions to achieve rate control. Many children will
have spontaneous resolution of the arrhythmia. Patients with incessant tachycardias will usually require
catheter ablation, which is associated with a high degree of success, a low complication rate, and a low
recurrence rate.

vasospasm.
» Beta-blockers are generally reserved for
patients who are not suspected to have taken

Focal atrial tachycardia Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
All patients should be referred for follow-up with either a primary care physician or cardiologist. The
urgency of the referral and need for cardiology follow-up depends on the likelihood of recurrence of
focal atrial tachycardia, risk of complications from therapies initiated, and planned interventions, such as
catheter ablation.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
congestive heart failure short term medium
Patients, including children, with sustained tachycardias may develop congestive heart failure.[22]
Treatment is focused on stopping the arrhythmia.
resistance to therapy short term medium
Many of these dysrhythmias are recurrent and resistant to pharmacologic intervention.
Refer for catheter ablation, which is curative in many cases.
cardiomyopathy short term low
This is a rare complication, secondary to incessant atrial tachycardia.
Cardiomyopathy is observed in patients with delayed presentations, often older children or patients with
already compromised cardiopulmonary reserves. It often reverses once the tachycardia is controlled.
Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the ability to control the arrhythmia. This is further influenced by the patient's age,
underlying cause of the arrhythmia, tolerance of adverse effects of the chosen treatment, and comorbidities.
Eventually, the rhythm is controlled in nearly all patients, but some may go through a period of trial and error,
ultimately needing ablative therapy. This treatment may have to be repeated.

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
