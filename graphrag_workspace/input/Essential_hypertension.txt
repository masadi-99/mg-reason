Essential hypertension Overview
Summary
Essential hypertension is typically diagnosed by screening of an asymptomatic individual.
Treatment of uncontrolled hypertension reduces the risks of mortality and of cardiac, vascular, renal, and
cerebrovascular complications.
Lifestyle changes are recommended for all patients: weight loss, exercise, decreased sodium intake, Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, and moderation of alcohol consumption.
Choice of drug therapy is often driven by considerations related to comorbid disease, but achievement of
blood pressure goal may be accomplished with a variety of therapeutic agent(s).
Definition
Essential hypertension is defined as persistently raised blood pressure (BP) with no secondary cause
identified.[1] [2] The main goal of treatment is to decrease the risk of mortality and of cardiovascular and
renal morbidity.[3]
The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline defines
hypertension as systolic BP measurement of ≥130 mmHg or diastolic BP measurement of ≥80 mmHg.[2]
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines define hypertension as office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg
and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg, which is equivalent to a 24-hour ambulatory BP measurement average of
≥130/80 mmHg, a daytime ambulatory BP or a home BP measurement average of ≥135/85 mmHg.[1]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends starting pharmacologic antihypertensive treatment in
patients with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and systolic BP of ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥90
mmHg.[4]
BP goals and recommendations continue to evolve in line with new evidence.

Essential hypertension Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
According to a global analysis of trends in hypertension, the number of adults ages 30-79 years with
hypertension increased from 650 million to 1.28 billion in the period 1990-2019.[5] The study also suggested
that 53% of women and 62% of men with hypertension were not receiving antihypertensive treatment and
that blood pressure (BP) was controlled (receiving antihypertensive medication and BP <140/90 mmHg) in
fewer than 1 in 4 women and 1 in 5 men with hypertension.[5] The rate of hypertension has decreased in
high-income countries, which now have some of the lowest rates, but has increased in many low- or middle-
income countries. 
In the US, surveillance definitions vary widely. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) data from 2017 to 2020, the American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that the age-adjusted
prevalence of hypertension (defined as self-reported use of antihypertensive medication, systolic BP ≥130
mmHg, or diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg) among US adults ≥20 years of age is 46.7%, which equates to 122.4
million adults (age ≥20 years) with high BP in the US.[6] Prevalence increases with age: using NHANES
2017 to 2020 data it was 28.5% among 20- to 44-year-olds, 58.6% among those 45-64 years, and 76.5%
among those 65 years of age and over.[6] Prevalence is highest in non-Hispanic black men (57.5%) and
non-Hispanic black women (58.4%).[6] Prevalence is higher in men than in women before 65 years of age,
and higher in women than in men from 65 years of age.[2] [6] The lifetime risk is 90% for men and women
who were normotensive at 55 years of age and survive to 80 years.[7] Studies using data from NHANES
have shown that the decline in BP control from 2013-2014 to 2017-2020 (54.1% to 48.3%) did not continue
through 2021-2023 with control increasing to 51.1%.[8] [9]
Etiology
A multifactorial and heterogeneous etiology of essential hypertension has been proposed.[10] The following
factors have been shown to disrupt the delicate balance of cardiac output and resistance, ultimately resulting
in hypertension:
• Disturbance of autoregulation (reflex and persistently increasing vascular resistance to match an
increased cardiac output)[11]
• Excess sodium intake through a variety of mechanisms[12] [13]
• Renal sodium retention[14] [15] [16] [17]
• Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, with elevated plasma renin activity[18]
• Increased sympathetic drive[19]
• Increased peripheral resistance[20]
• Endothelial dysfunction[21]
• Cell membrane transporter perturbations[22]
• Insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia.[23] [24] [25]
Pathophysiology
Blood pressure (BP), the product of cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance, is affected by
preload, contractility, vessel hypertrophy, and peripheral constriction. The pathology associated with,
and the perpetuation of, the hypertensive state involves structural changes, remodeling, and hypertrophy
in resistance arterioles.[26] These changes have also been associated with the early and progressive
development of small vessel atherosclerosis, which is likely the cause of end-organ damage seen
in advanced hypertension. This occurs through a complex series of interrelated processes including

thrombosis, endothelial injury and dysfunction, the inflammatory cascade, oxidative stress, and autonomic
dysregulation in the setting of genetic predisposition.[27]
Trials have demonstrated the importance of systolic BP in the pathophysiology of hypertension and its
associated complications, which differs from older conventional thinking.[28] The rise in systolic BP continues
throughout life, in contrast to diastolic BP, which increases until approximately 50 years of age, tends to level
off over the following decade, and may stabilize or decline subsequently.
Case history
Case history #1
A 64-year-old black man presents for a routine visit to establish care. He denies past medical problems,
but has been told that his blood pressure was a little high. He has no complaints, takes no medications,
tries to adhere to a healthy diet, and rarely exercises. He reports that over the previous 5 years he has
gained 15 lb (6.8 kg). Review of systems is otherwise noncontributory. Physical exam is notable for
obesity and blood pressure 172/86 mmHg. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.
Other presentations
Essential hypertension is typically an asymptomatic disease state at its onset and time of diagnosis. It
may be associated with headache or visual changes, but this is rare outside of hypertensive urgency/
emergency situations.

Essential hypertension Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Most patients diagnosed with hypertension are asymptomatic; therefore, screening is essential. Patients are
usually evaluated through history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests. The three objectives are
to:
• Assess risk factors
• Reveal identifiable causes
• Detect target-organ damage, including evidence of cardiovascular disease.
Clinical evaluation
History may elicit family history of hypertension or chronic coronary disease risk factors. It is important
to assess overall cardiac risk burden.[1] The age of onset may be of value when considering etiology,
as the proportion of secondary causes diminishes with increasing age. Patients at increased risk for
essential hypertension include those over 60 years of age, or with diabetes, or of black ancestry.[3] [45]
 Excess alcohol intake or lack of exercise should be documented. A thorough medication history should
be taken including screening for use of oral contraceptive pills, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
sympathomimetics, or herbal medications. Most patients are asymptomatic, but clinical indications of
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or catecholamine excess (e.g., tachycardia, weight loss, sweating, or
palpitations), or end-organ damage (e.g., shortness of breath, chest pain, or sensory/motor deficits),
should be sought. Headache or visual changes are unusual.
The physical examination should include:[1] [2] [63][64] [65]
• Office blood pressure (BP) measurement: the patient should be seated quietly for at least 5
minutes, with feet on the floor and arm supported at heart level. Caffeine, smoking, and exercise
should be avoided for 30 minutes prior to measurement. An appropriately sized cuff should be used
and the patient's arm should be supported (e.g., resting on a desk). The bladder should encircle at
least 80% of the arm. At the first visit, BP should be recorded in both arms, using the arm that gives
the higher reading for subsequent visits. Two or more measurements should be made on two or
more occasions and the average recorded. Verification should be obtained in the contralateral arm.
The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline defines
hypertension as any systolic BP measurement of ≥130 mmHg or any diastolic BP measurement of
≥80 mmHg.[2] The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Hypertension
(ESH) guidelines define hypertension as office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90
mmHg.[1] [63]
• Examination of optic fundi
• Calculation of BMI from height and weight
• Auscultation for possible carotid, abdominal, or femoral bruits
• Palpation of the thyroid gland
• Examination of the heart and lungs
• Examination of the abdomen for enlarged kidneys, masses, distended urinary bladder, or abnormal
aortic pulsation
• Palpation of the lower extremities for edema and pulses
• Neurologic assessment.
Physical exam may reveal end-organ damage associated with untreated hypertension: for example,
retinopathy, vascular bruits, signs of congestive heart failure, evidence of aortic aneurysm (pulsatile mass/
bruit), left ventricular hypertrophy (displaced point of maximal impact), or neurologic deficit(s). Absence

of femoral pulses suggests coarctation of the aorta. An abdominal bruit may suggest aortic aneurysm
or renal artery stenosis. Occasionally, patients may have stigmata of endocrinopathy such as Cushing
disease (moon face, centripetal obesity, striae), acromegaly (acral enlargement), Graves disease (goiter,
exophthalmos, pretibial myxedema), or hypothyroidism (dry skin, delayed return of deep tendon reflexes),
indicating a secondary cause of hypertension.
US and European guidelines recommend the use of out-of-office BP measurement in addition to office
BP measurement prior to diagnosis of hypertension, using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)
or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), or both.[2] [63][66][67] With ABPM, patients go about
their normal daily activities wearing a monitor, and measurements are taken periodically to provide a
mean BP during the monitoring period. With HBPM, the patient takes BP measurements in the morning
and evening while seated and resting, and this is repeated over a period of days to provide a mean
BP. Thresholds for elevated BP measured by ABPM and HBPM differ to thresholds used in the office;
guidelines provide corresponding values.[1] [2] [63][67] For example, according to ACC/AHA guidelines,
an office BP measurement of 130/80 mmHg corresponds to home BP 130/80 mmHg, daytime ABPM
130/80 mmHg, nighttime ABPM 110/65 mmHg, and 24-hour ABPM 125/75 mmHg.[2] In ESH guidelines,
hypertension is defined as an office BP measurement of ≥140 mmHg (systolic) and/or ≥90 mmHg
(diastolic), which corresponds to mean awake ABPM ≥135 mmHg and/or ≥85 mmHg, mean asleep ABPM
≥120 mmHg and/or ≥70 mmHg, mean 24-hour ABPM ≥130 mmHg and/or ≥80 mmHg, and mean HBPM
≥135 mmHg and/or ≥85 mmHg.[63]
Auscultatory devices (e.g., mercury, aneroid) are not generally useful for HBPM because patients rarely
master the required technique for BP measurement using these devices. Automated validated devices
should be used instead. European guidelines also now recommend that automatic electronic devices are
used for office measurement, rather than manual devices.[63]
Unattended automated office blood pressure (AOBP) is another option that has been designed to more
accurately measure BP.[64] Multiple measurements are taken while the patient is alone in a quiet room,
sitting with legs uncrossed, back supported, and arm supported at heart level. Depending on the device
used, 3 to 6 measurements are taken over a short time period and the mean BP is calculated.[68] AOBP
measures about 5 mmHg lower than research-quality BPs, and 10 to 15 mmHg lower than routine office
BP measurements.[69] [70] When using AOBP, hypertension is defined as ≥135/85 mmHg.
White-coat hypertension is suspected when BP readings in the office exceed those outside of the clinical
setting. Masked hypertension is suspected when out-of-office BP measurements exceed those taken in
the clinical setting. ABPM or HBPM can be used to identify these patients.[2] [63]
Tests
Routine metabolic panel and lipid levels, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio are required. Serum
creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be calculated according to the race-
free Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation (formulas available with
and without cystatin).[1]  In particular, features of metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia) or
hyperuricemia should be noted. For patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD),
it is recommended to repeat serum creatinine, eGFR, and UACR at least annually to monitor disease
progression.[1] Hemoglobin and routine urinalysis are also recommended for possible identification of
causes of hypertension. An ECG should be obtained. 
Extensive testing for secondary causes of hypertension is generally not indicated, unless BP is difficult to
control or clinical or routine lab data suggest identifiable secondary causes such as signs of unprovoked

hypokalemia or renal insufficiency.[2] Echocardiogram and carotid Dopplers may have prognostic
implications, but they are not routinely recommended except as recommended by guidelines. There was
increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with increased left ventricular mass and
abnormal geometric left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram.[71] [72] Increased cardiovascular
events were associated with higher intima media thickness values on carotid Dopplers.[73] Urinary
albumin to creatinine ratio is useful for evaluation of target organ damage.[2] [63]
Sleep study may be considered in cases of resistant hypertension, and also for patients with signs or
symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.[46]
If secondary hypertension is suggested by history, or physical or routine laboratory testing, further testing
can be performed.[1]
• Signs/symptoms of catecholamine excess require pheochromocytoma screen.
• Signs/symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism require thyroid-stimulating hormone.
• Unprovoked hypokalemia prompts measurement of plasma renin activity/aldosterone,
catecholamines, and a search for clues (such as striae) to suggest hypercortisolism.
• Measurement of plasma aldosterone and renin is also indicated in the following situations: BP
is sustained above 150/100 mmHg on 3 measurements over different days, with hypertension
resistant to 3 conventional antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic), or controlled BP
(140/90 mmHg) on 4 or more antihypertensive drugs; hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-
induced hypokalemia; hypertension and adrenal incidentaloma; hypertension and sleep apnea;
hypertension and a family history of early-onset hypertension or cerebrovascular accident at a
young age (40 years); hypertensive first-degree relatives of patients with primary aldosteronism.[74]
The 2024 ESC guidelines recommend that screening for primary aldosteronism by renin and
aldosterone measurements should be considered in all adults with confirmed hypertension (BP
≥140/90 mmHg).[1]
• Renal artery imaging is done for young patients with difficult-to-control hypertension or who have
abdominal bruits.[1] Imaging may show renal scarring or lesions.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg (common)
• The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline defines
hypertension as systolic BP measurement of ≥130 mmHg or diastolic BP measurement of ≥80
mmHg.[2] The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH)
guidelines define hypertension as office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg.[1]
[63]
retinopathy (common)
• Retinal vascular changes are seen commonly in long-standing hypertension.

Other diagnostic factors
headache (uncommon)
• Rarely a presenting symptom, unless hypertension is acute or in the setting of hypertensive urgency.
visual changes (uncommon)
• Decreased visual acuity or floaters, papilledema (rare).
dyspnea (uncommon)
• Suggests possible comorbid congestive heart failure or chronic coronary disease. Dyspnea may be an
anginal equivalent, particularly in the setting of diabetes.
chest pain (uncommon)
• Suggests chronic coronary disease.
sensory or motor deficit (uncommon)
• Suggests cerebrovascular disease.
Risk factors
Strong
obesity
• Obesity is strongly associated with hypertension. Data from the Nurses' Health Study showed that a
gain of 5 kg above weight at 18 years of age was associated with 60% higher risk of development of
hypertension in middle age.[29] A 4.5 mmHg increase in blood pressure has been associated with
each 10 lb (4.5 kg) gain in weight.[30] One systematic review found that risk of hypertension increased
continuously with increasing body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, weight gain, and waist-
to-hip and waist-to-height ratio.[31] One study found that younger age at onset of overweight across
adulthood was associated with significantly increased risk of hypertension, with the highest relative risk
with onset of overweight at 18-39 years of age.[32]
• It has been postulated that the link between obesity and hypertension is driven by increased
circulating volume, leading to increased cardiac output and persistently elevated peripheral vascular
resistance.[33]
• Obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Abdominal
obesity has been specifically associated with an increased risk of hypertension, compared with
generalized obesity.[34]
• Bariatric treatment of class III obesity (BMI 40 or above) can reduce or eliminate risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, with an effect on hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.[35] [36] [37]
aerobic exercise <3 times/week
• Patients with low level of fitness had a 52% greater relative risk of hypertension at 12-year follow-up
compared with those with high levels of fitness.[38]
moderate/high alcohol intake
• Chronic alcohol consumption of more than 1 drink per day in women and more than 2 drinks per day
in men has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of blood pressure (BP) elevation.[2]

DIAGNOSIS
[39] One Cochrane review of the effect of alcohol on BP found that high-dose alcohol (>30 g) has a
biphasic effect, decreasing BP up to 12 hours after consumption and increasing BP after 13 hours.[40]
 Another systematic review and meta-analysis in healthy adults found a direct linear relationship
between alcohol consumption and BP, with no suggestion of a threshold, particularly for systolic
BP.[41]
metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome
• Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of common conditions, including insulin resistance, impaired
glucose tolerance, abdominal obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, elevated
triglycerides, and hypertension; there are multiple varying sets of criteria for diagnosis and not all
components need to be present for a diagnosis to be made. See Metabolic syndrome .
• CKM syndrome is a disorder defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) to reflect the
connections between metabolic disease (obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome), kidney disease, and
cardiovascular disease (CVD).[42] It includes both individuals at risk for CVD (due to the presence
of metabolic risk factors, chronic kidney disease, or both) and individuals with existing CVD. Poor
cardiovascular-kidney metabolic health affects nearly all organ systems and is associated with
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The AHA has proposed a CKM syndrome staging system
based on patient risk factors and opportunities for prevention and care. The AHA recommends that
these patients are managed by an interdisciplinary team with targeted referral of high-risk CKM
patients to appropriate subspecialists.[43]
• Abdominal obesity has been specifically associated with an increased risk of hypertension, compared
with generalized obesity.[34] Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are thought to contribute to the
development of hypertension through a variety of inflammatory mechanisms.[23] [24] [25] [42] Risk of
hypertension is increased in the presence of dyslipidemia and abdominal obesity.[44]
diabetes mellitus
• Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance lead to endothelial damage and oxidative
stress, and are independently associated with the development of hypertension.[45]
black ancestry
• Highest incidence of hypertension is seen in black non-Hispanic people, at all age levels.[3]
age >60 years
• Incidence of hypertension increases with age in people of all ancestries and both sexes.[3]
family history of hypertension or chronic coronary disease
• Patient may have family history of hypertension or chronic coronary disease risk factors.[1]
sleep apnea
• Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases, including
hypertension.[2] [46] OSA and hypertension also have risk factors in common, such as obesity
and alcohol use, and frequently coexist. In addition, there is a possible dose-response relationship
between the severity of OSA and the risk of essential hypertension.[47]
• OSA is also associated with an increased risk of resistant hypertension.[48] Successful treatment of
OSA has been shown to improve BP.[49]

sodium intake >1.5 g/day
• Individuals show a varied tolerance for sodium intake, and reduced sodium intake has modest effect
on blood pressure (BP) lowering.[12] [13] Meta-analyses have shown the amount of BP lowering
achieved with sodium reduction has a dose-response relation and is greater for older populations,
nonwhite populations, and those with higher baseline systolic BP.[50] [51]
low fruit and vegetable intake
• A diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products (Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension [DASH] diet) has been associated with a significantly lower systolic blood pressure
(BP).[52] A higher vegetable nitrate intake has been associated with a lower baseline systolic and
diastolic BP.[53]
dyslipidemia
• Hypertension often coexists with dyslipidemia. Risk of hypertension is increased in the presence of
dyslipidemia and abdominal obesity.[44]
smoking
• Cigarette smoking acutely raises BP, mainly through the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous
system; however, the chronic effect of smoking on hypertension is uncertain.[54]

Essential hypertension Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Blood pressure (BP) is categorized in four levels based on an average of two or more properly taken BP
measurements on two or more occasions in a healthcare setting (office setting):
• Normal BP: systolic BP <120 mmHg and diastolic BP <80 mmHg
• Elevated BP: systolic BP 120-129 mmHg and diastolic BP <80 mmHg
• Stage 1 hypertension: systolic BP 130-139 mmHg or diastolic BP 80-89 mmHg
• Stage 2 hypertension: systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP 90 mmHg
2024 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the
management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension[1]
Cut-offs for the definition of hypertension for specific measurements are as follows.
Office BP
• Non-elevated BP: systolic BP <120 mmHg and diastolic BP <70 mmHg
• Elevated BP: systolic BP 120-139 mmHg and diastolic BP 70-89 mmHg
• Grade 1 hypertension: systolic BP 140-159 mmHg and/or diastolic BP 90-99 mmHg
• Grade 2 hypertension: systolic BP 160-179 mmHg and/or diastolic BP 100-109 mmHg
• Grade 3 hypertension: systolic BP ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg
• Isolated systolic hypertension: systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and diastolic BP <90 mmHg
• Isolated diastolic hypertension: systolic BP <140 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg
Ambulatory BP
• Systolic BP ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg for 24-hour BP
• Systolic BP ≥135 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg for daytime ambulatory BP and home BP
• Systolic BP ≥120 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥70 mmHg for nighttime BP
Hypertension Canada's 2020 comprehensive guidelines for
diagnosis, risk assessment, prevention, and treatment of
hypertension in adults and children[76]
BP is assessed using the following four approaches:
• Automated office BP: a displayed mean systolic BP ≥135 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥85 mmHg is high.
• Non-automated office BP: a mean systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg is high, and
a systolic BP between 130 and 139 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP between 85 and 89 mmHg is high-
normal.
• Ambulatory BP monitoring: patients can be diagnosed as hypertensive if the mean awake systolic BP
is ≥135 mmHg or the diastolic BP is ≥85 mmHg, or if the mean 24-hour systolic BP is ≥130 mmHg or
the diastolic BP is ≥80 mmHg.
• Home BP monitoring: patients can be diagnosed as hypertensive if the mean systolic BP is ≥135
mmHg or the diastolic BP is ≥85 mmHg. If the office BP measurement is high and the mean home BP
is <135/85 mmHg, it is advisable to either repeat home monitoring to confirm the home BP is <135/85
mmHg or perform 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring to confirm that the mean 24-hour ambulatory BP
monitoring is <130/80 mmHg and the mean awake ambulatory BP monitoring is <135/85 mmHg before
diagnosing white-coat hypertension.

Essential hypertension Diagnosis
Screening
The vast majority of hypertensive patients will be detected during an asymptomatic screening during some
contact with the medical system. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended
annual screening for adults ages ≥40 years or for those at increased risk for high blood pressure (BP) (high-
normal BP, overweight or obese, or African-American). Adults ages 18-39 years with normal BP without other
risk factors were advised to be rescreened every 3-5 years.[66] The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/
American Heart Association (AHA) guideline, however, recommends annual screening in all patients with
normal BP.[2] Measurements should be obtained outside of the clinical setting (ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring [ABPM] or home blood pressure monitoring [HBPM]) to confirm the diagnosis.[2] [66] If a patient
has an untreated systolic BP >130 mmHg but <160 mmHg or diastolic BP >80 mmHg but <100 mmHg,
it is reasonable to screen for the presence of white-coat hypertension by using either daytime ABPM or
HBPM before diagnosis of hypertension.[2] In adults with elevated office BP (120-129/<80 mmHg) but not
meeting the criteria for hypertension, screening for masked hypertension with daytime ABPM or HBPM is
reasonable. Guidelines for other countries may recommend different screening intervals. The 2024 ESC
guideline recommends annual screening for individuals with elevated BP (120-139 mmHg systolic or 70-89
mmHg diastolic) or for those ages ≥40 years. For individuals ages <40 years with non-elevated BP, screening
is recommended at least every 3 years.[1]
These screening guidelines are often exceeded, as BP measurement is standard for each encounter in
many practice settings. Elevated readings should always be confirmed on a second visit prior to diagnosing
hypertension.

Essential hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The main goal of treatment is to decrease the risk of mortality and of cardiovascular and renal morbidity.[3]
[80] [Evidence A] Treatment options include lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive drugs.
The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline recommends a
blood pressure (BP) target of <130/80 mmHg for adults, regardless of age, with confirmed hypertension
and known cardiovascular disease (CVD), or a 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk (using the atherosclerotic
CVD [ASCVD] risk estimator) of 10% or more.[2]  For adults with confirmed hypertension without additional
markers of increased CVD risk, a BP target of <130/80 mmHg may be reasonable.   
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines
recommend an initial treatment target of <140/90 mmHg in all patients (<140/80 mmHg in the 2023 ESH
guideline). If treatment is well tolerated, the BP can then be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most
patients.[1][63]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a target BP of <140/90 mmHg in all patients with
hypertension without comorbidities. In those with hypertension and known CVD or at high CVD risk, with
diabetes, or with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the WHO recommends a target systolic BP <130mmHg.[4]
For a comparison of ACC/AHA and ESC targets and management, please see:  [US and European
guidelines - classification and management] (https://staticweb.bmj.com/BP/HypertensionGuidelines/
HypertensionGuidelines-2017-US-vs-2018-European-V3.png)
Evolving treatment goals
BP goals are evolving as more studies are being carried out.[81] The SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood
Pressure Intervention Trial) ended early as it found that a lower systolic target of 120 mmHg (as measured
by automated office blood pressure [AOBP]) reduced cardiovascular complications and deaths in people
ages over 50 years with high BP and at least one additional risk factor for heart disease.[82] [83] [84]
 Patients with diabetes or stroke were excluded from the trial. However, in the HOPE-3 trial, intermediate-
risk people without cardiovascular disease did not benefit from BP lowering unless in the highest tertile
of starting BP (>143.5 mmHg) (as opposed to higher-risk patients in SPRINT).[85] [86] The STEP trial
was also ended early, as it found that patients ages 60-80 years with hypertension treated to a systolic BP
target of 110 to <130 mmHg had a lower incidence of cardiovascular events (composite of stroke, acute
coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure, coronary revascularization, atrial fibrillation,
or death from cardiovascular causes) than those treated to a target of 130 to <150 mmHg.[87] In the
STEP trial, office BP was measured by trained staff, with home BP measurements also used as an
adjunct. Patients with diabetes were included, though the benefit of intensive treatment was not seen
in these patients; patients with prior stroke were not included. In the STEP trial, intensive treatment did
not have a significant effect on cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.[87] Longer-term follow-up of the
SPRINT trial found that after the trial ended, the beneficial effect on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality
did not persist, noting the importance of consistent long-term control of hypertension beyond the trial
protocols.[88]
Because of differences in the general health of older patients, the decision to treat should be on an
individual basis, and BP lowering should be gradual and carefully monitored by the physician.[1] [89]
 The SPRINT trial results showed equal benefit in people ages >75 years, regardless of frailty or walking
speed.[90] [91] Patients with orthostasis at enrollment, patients with dementia, and those resident in a

nursing home were excluded from the trial. One systematic review found insufficient evidence regarding
the benefits of hypertension treatment for frail people >80 years of age taking multiple medications,
concluding that treatment should be individualized.[92] Older patients >80 years should not be denied
treatment or have treatment withdrawn solely on the basis of age.[1]
One Cochrane review of treatment goals in people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular
disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease) concluded that
there was no benefit in treating to lower BP targets (≤135/85 mmHg) compared with standard BP targets
(≤140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg) in terms of total and cardiovascular mortality or
cardiovascular events.[93]
Regarding patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus, there is good-quality evidence from the ACCORD trial
that very intensive BP lowering (targeting a systolic pressure <120 mmHg, as compared with targeting
<140 mmHg) does not lessen risk (composite outcome: nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or
death from cardiovascular cause) and may increase risk of adverse events.[94] One systematic review
and meta-analysis found that intensive BP lowering (systolic BP <130 mmHg) was associated with
reduced risk of major cardiovascular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes; a target systolic BP <140
mmHg was associated with reduced all-cause death, though further reduction did not result in further
benefits.[95] The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that BP targets in people with
diabetes and hypertension are individualized by assessing cardiovascular risk, potential adverse effects,
and patient preference.[96] The ACC/AHA and the ADA both recommend a BP goal of <130/80 mmHg for
patients with diabetes.[2] [96]
Evidence from the ESPRIT and BPROAD trials indicate that intensive BP lowering in high-risk patients
(targeting a systolic pressure <120 mmHg) significantly reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events,
compared with standard targets (<140 mmHg). However, this approach may increase the risk of adverse
events, including symptomatic hypotension and hyperkalemia.[97] [98]
Lifestyle modification and CVD risk reduction
The initial approach to a newly diagnosed patient should include a thorough explanation of the risks
associated with hypertension and the need for adequate control and adherence to therapy.
The initial therapeutic measure should be lifelong lifestyle modification, which includes:[1] [2] [52] [63][99]
[100] [101]
• Sodium reduction (optimal goal ≤1.5 g/day). Use of salt substitutes has demonstrated BP-mediated
protective effects for major cardiovascular events and mortality.[59] [60] [102] [103]
• Potassium supplementation (3.5 to 5.0 g/day). Preferably by consumption of a potassium-rich diet
unless contraindicated.
• Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (8-10 servings of fruit and vegetables daily,
whole grains, low sodium, low-fat proteins).
• Waist circumference <40 inches (<102 cm) for men and <35 inches (<88 cm) for women; weight
loss to a BMI of about 25 kg/m².
• Increased physical activity. At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity, dynamic aerobic exercise
(walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming) 5 days per week to total 150 minutes per week, as
tolerated or recommended by physician.
• Limited alcohol consumption. ≤2 standard drinks (<20-30 g alcohol) per day in hypertensive
men; ≤1 standard drink (<10-20 g alcohol) per day in hypertensive women. Total weekly alcohol
consumption should not exceed 140 g for men and 80 g for women. There is evidence to suggest

that the relationship between alcohol consumption and BP is direct and linear, with no threshold,
particularly for systolic BP.[41]
Advice about lifestyle modification should be given upon diagnosis and should continue concurrently with
all other therapeutic measures. Prior to initiation of an exercise program, patients should discuss a plan
with their healthcare provider.
Obesity is a major risk factor for hypertension. In addition to lifestyle modifications for weight loss,
antiobesity pharmacotherapy and metabolic surgery may be considered in select patients to treat obesity
and prevent or attenuate hypertension.[104] See Obesity in adults .
Smoking cessation should always be encouraged as well, to promote general vascular health, though
smoking cessation has not been associated with decreased BP. See Smoking cessation .
Management of other modifiable CVD risk factors, such as concomitant dyslipidemia, is also
recommended in adults with hypertension.[1] [2] [63] Lipid-lowering therapy may be initiated based on
estimated CV risk. See Hypercholesterolemia  and Hypertriglyceridemia .
Antihypertensive drugs
The main classes of antihypertensives include:[1] [2]
• Diuretics:
• Thiazide (or thiazide-like): e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, indapamide
• ACE inhibitors: e.g., lisinopril, enalapril, benazepril, perindopril, ramipril
• Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists: e.g., candesartan, irbesartan, losartan, azilsartan, telmisartan,
valsartan
• Calcium-channel blockers: e.g., amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem
• Beta-blockers: e.g., metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol.
The examples of antihypertensive drugs listed above are common examples of drugs in each class only;
other drugs are available. Some of these drugs are available in fixed-dose combination formulations.
These single pill formulations simplify dosing regimens and improve adherence.[1] [8] [105]
Considerations for antihypertensive drug regimens in the presence of key comorbidities (CVD, diabetes,
renal) are given in the sections below.
Beta-blockers are not generally recommended for first-line treatment of hypertension. However, they can
be used as first-line, or at any step, when indicated as guideline-directed medical therapy, e.g., in the
presence of comorbid chronic coronary disease, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation, or can be considered in
the presence of other comorbid conditions where their use can be favorable.[2] [63] [106] 
Calcium-channel blockers may cause peripheral edema that can lead to a diuretic being prescribed
(prescribing cascade); however, diuretics are generally not indicated in this situation as the edema is
not caused by fluid overload and unnecessary use of diuretics may lead to increased risk of adverse
events.[107]
The Diuretic Comparison Project compared hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone in patients ages
65 years or older; patients were already receiving hydrochlorothiazide and were randomized to either
continue or switch to chlorthalidone. At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, there was no difference between
the groups in the primary composite outcome of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure

resulting in hospitalization, urgent coronary revascularization for unstable angina, and non-cancer-related
death.[108]
Initiating therapy for stage 1 hypertension
The ACC/AHA guideline defines stage 1 hypertension as BP 130-139/80-89 mmHg.[2] According to the
2024 ESC guidelines, office systolic BP of 120-139 mmHg and diastolic BP of 70-89 mmHg is defined as
elevated BP.[1]
CVD risk assessment tools are used to guide initial approach to therapy and whether the patient should
receive antihypertensive medication or can be managed with lifestyle modifications.[1] [2] [4] The ACC/
AHA guideline recommends using the Pooled Cohort Equations to assess 10-year atherosclerotic CVD
risk. The PREVENT™ calculator is also available; this is a newer calculator from the AHA that estimates
the 10- and 30-year risk of total CVD for people ages 30 years and older.
The ACC/AHA guideline recommends that patients with stage 1 hypertension and assessed as at low risk
of CVD (<10% 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk) may initially be managed with lifestyle modifications and
reassessment in 3-6 months to determine if pharmacologic therapy is necessary.[2] [109] Most patients
will require drug therapy to achieve target BP control.
For stage 1 hypertension, combination therapy or monotherapy where appropriate can be initiated.[2]
[110]  The choice of antihypertensive agent is driven by efficacy, adverse-effect profile, and cost. The
ACC/AHA guideline recommends initiating a single antihypertensive agent for patients with a 10-year
atherosclerotic CVD risk ≥10% or known concomitant cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or CKD.[2] 
The ESC guideline states that adults with documented CVD, including asymptomatic atheromatous
disease on imaging, heart failure, type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe CKD, hypertension-
mediated organ damage, and familial hypercholesterolemia are automatically considered to be at high or
very high CVD risk and do not need formal risk assessment.[1] For all other patients with hypertension,
the ESC guideline recommends that 10-year CVD mortality risk is estimated using the SCORE system. 
[ESC: SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP] (https://www.escardio.org/Education/Practice-Tools/CVD-prevention-
toolbox/SCORE-Risk-Charts)  European guidelines recommend initiating antihypertensive treatment
with a two-drug combination, preferably a single pill combination, with the exception of patients with
elevated BP and a high cardiovascular risk or in frail older patients in whom initiating treatment with
monotherapy may be appropriate.[1] [63] In patients with elevated BP and a high cardiovascular risk only
a small reduction in BP may be required to achieve the BP target, and in frail older patients baroreflex
sensitivity is frequently impaired and the risk of hypotension is greater.[1] For lower-risk patients with
grade 1 hypertension, the 2024 ESC guidelines advise that antihypertensive treatment should be initiated
after 3 months if BP is not controlled by lifestyle interventions alone.[1]
If BP cannot be controlled with a single agent, a drug from a different class of antihypertensives is added.
Stage 1 hypertension: without CVD-related comorbidity or chronic
renal disease, or with diabetes
A choice among four preferred classes of drugs is recommended for initial therapy.[1] [2] [111] [112]
Thiazide (or thiazide-like) diuretics have been shown to be safe and efficacious first-line
therapy.[113] Initial dose of antihypertensive medications depends on clinical situation; medications are
titrated for a therapeutic effect, while observing for potential adverse effects.

MANAGEMENT
Alternative first-line choices include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, or calcium-
channel blockers, or a combination of two different drugs from these classes (excluding the combination
of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists; generally, when an ACE inhibitor would usually
be chosen but is not tolerated, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist can be substituted).
In the general black population, including those with comorbid diabetes, a thiazide (or thiazide-like)
diuretic or a calcium-channel blocker is recommended as initial pharmacologic therapy.[1] [2] The
recommendation is derived from a prespecified subgroup analysis of black patients, 46% of whom
had diabetes, in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial
(ALLHAT).[114] [115]
In patients with diabetes who have increased albumin excretion, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists are recommended. The ALLHAT study showed that chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril
were co-equal for mild hypertension in type 2 diabetes.[114] ACE inhibitors are renoprotective, decreasing
the progression of proteinuria in patients with diabetes.[116] Sleep-time BP is the most significant
independent prognostic marker of cardiovascular events in diabetes.
Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated BP-lowering effects and may be
considered in patients with type 2 diabetes.[117] In trials, the SGLT2 inhibitors empaglifozin, dapagliflozin,
and canagliflozin have been found to lower systolic and diastolic BP and cardiovascular risk in people
with type 2 diabetes compared with placebo.[118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] The glucagon-
like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonists liraglutide and semaglutide have also shown a beneficial
effect on BP.[125] [126] However, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor antagonists are not specifically
licensed for BP-lowering and therefore they can only be considered in the management of hypertension
in patients with a comorbid condition, such as diabetes, for which they can be prescribed. See Diabetic
cardiovascular disease .
Stage 2 hypertension
The ACC/AHA guideline defines stage 2 hypertension as BP ≥140/90 mmHg.[2] The ESH guidelines
define this category of BP in three grades:[63]
• Grade 1 hypertension BP 140-159/90-99 mmHg
• Grade 2 hypertension 160-179/100-109 mmHg
• Grade 3 hypertension ≥180 mmHg/110 mmHg
Patients presenting with stage 2 hypertension will require more than one drug for BP control. Therefore,
the initiation of two concurrent antihypertensives of different classes is recommended.
The combination of a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker with a beta-blocker should be avoided,
because of an increased risk of high-degree atrioventricular block.
Comorbid chronic coronary disease (CCD)
Guidelines recommend a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist for patients
with CCD and hypertension.[1] [2] [127] Other drugs such as dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers,
thiazide diuretics, and/or aldosterone receptor antagonists (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) are
added as required to further control hypertension.
A beta-blocker offers cardioprotective effects in patients with chronic artery disease (CAD), decreasing
myocardial wall stress and lessening myocardial oxygen demand. ACE inhibitors have been shown in

some trials to decrease cardiovascular events, while other studies have not demonstrated a benefit for
ACE inhibitors in the setting of stable CAD with normal left ventricular function.[128] [129] [130] 
Many patients with CCD also take nitrates, which act as an exogenous nitric oxide donor. Modest
reductions in systolic BP can be observed, but the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the
use of nitrates solely as antihypertensive therapy. See Chronic coronary disease .
Comorbid heart failure (HF)
Recommended medications for HF also lower BP; however, HF guidelines note that clinical trials
assessing the impact of BP reduction on outcomes in patients with hypertension and HF are lacking and
that the optimal BP goal and antihypertensive regimen are not known.[131] [132]
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
Treatment of HFrEF (left ventricular EF <40%) is similar in hypertensive and normotensive patients. For
most patients with HFrEF, a combination of drugs from the following four medication classes should be
started initially and continued long-term:[132]
• Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [ARNi], ACE inhibitor,
or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist)
• Beta-blockers
• Aldosterone receptor antagonists
• SGLT2 inhibitors.
Patients who have signs of congestion and volume overload are also prescribed diuretics.
Additionally, the combination of hydralazine and a nitrate (e.g., isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine) has been
shown to be of benefit for black patients who have persistent symptoms despite receiving optimal medical
therapy, as well as in all patients with HF who cannot receive ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists, or ARNi because of intolerance or contraindications.[131] [132]
Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are not recommended for the treatment of hypertension in
adults with HFrEF.[2]
For more information, see  Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction .
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
HFpEF is defined as symptoms and signs of HF, with left ventricular EF ≥50%.[133]
Diuretics should be used to control hypertension in patients with comorbid HFpEF who present with
symptoms of volume overload.[2]
While optimal BP goal and antihypertensive regimens are not known for patients with HFpEF, the
American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of
America (HFSA) guideline for management of HF advises that ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists, aldosterone antagonists, and possibly ARNi could be first-line agents to control BP, given
experience with their use in HFpEF trials.[131] Similarly, a 2023 expert consensus document from the
ACC suggests that, in addition to diuretics, patients with hypertension and HFpEF can be treated with
ARNis, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, and aldosterone antagonists.[134]

SGLT2 inhibitors (which have demonstrated BP-lowering effects) are also now recommended in the US
and European guidelines for all patients with HFpEF.[131] [134] [135] For more information, see Heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction .
Comorbid left ventricular hypertrophy
ACE inhibition has proven beneficial across a myriad of cardiovascular disease states including CHF
and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).[128] [129] An angiotensin-II receptor antagonist is first choice for
comorbid LVH. Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality
in patients with hypertension and LVH.[136]
Comorbid renal disease
An ACE inhibitor is first choice for comorbid renal disease (CKD stage 3 or higher or stage 1 or 2 with
albuminuria [≥300 mg/day or ≥300 mg/g albumin-to-creatinine ratio or equivalent in the first morning
void]).[2] If an ACE inhibitor is not tolerated, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist can be used.[137]
Continuing ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist therapy may be associated with
cardiovascular benefit as kidney function declines.[138]
Second-choice options are a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide diuretic. In the CLICK trial, in patients
with advanced CKD and poorly controlled hypertension, chlorthalidone therapy improved BP control at 12
weeks compared with placebo.[139] [140] A nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (i.e., diltiazem,
verapamil) may be indicated if there is proteinuria.[141]
Spironolactone may further reduce proteinuria when added to an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist, but also raises the risk of hyperkalemia.[142] [143] Spironolactone is usually added to an
ACE inhibitor, or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, after a thiazide diuretic has been added to minimize
hyperkalemia. Eplerenone can be used as an alternative.
The 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline for management of BP in CKD
recommends that patients with CKD are treated to a target systolic BP <120 mmHg, specifying that this
should be measured using standardized office BP measurement, preferably automated office BP.[137]
The ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating patients with CKD to a target of <130/80 mmHg.[2]
SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated renal benefits, and dapagliflozin may be considered in patients
with CKD (stages 2-4) with and without diabetes.[144] [145] [146] [147] Use of SGLT2 inhibitors is
contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <30 mL/minute/1.73 m².
Finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is approved for use in diabetic CKD
and has also been shown to have BP-lowering effects.[148] [149] SGLT2 inhibitors and finerenone are not
specifically licensed for BP-lowering and should be used according to their approval for CKD treatment in
addition to antihypertensive drug therapy.[63] For more information, see Chronic kidney disease . Data on
combining finerenone and SGLT2-inhibitors are limited.
Some drugs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and a dose adjustment may be
required. Some drugs may also be contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Consultation with a
nephrology specialist should be considered. See Chronic kidney disease .
Comorbid atrial fibrillation
First choice is a beta-blocker. Second choice is a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker.

Essential hypertension Management
Evidence from post-hoc analyses suggests that angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and ACE inhibitors
do not prevent the occurrence or the recurrence of atrial fibrillation.[150] [151] [152] [153] However, more
recent guidelines note that use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists may be effective
in the prevention of atrial fibrillation.[2] [154] More investigation is needed.
Recalcitrant (resistant) hypertension
Recalcitrant (resistant) hypertension is defined as above-goal elevated BP in a patient taking three
antihypertensive agents (commonly including a long-acting calcium-channel blocker, an ACE inhibitor
or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, and a diuretic) at maximally tolerated doses.[63] [79] Managing
recalcitrant hypertension requires expertise. Frequently requiring multiple antihypertensive agents,
patients must be observed and counseled regarding adverse effects, medication adherence, potential
drug-drug interactions, and metabolic abnormalities. Infrequently, patients will require a screen for
secondary causes of hypertension.
Representative agents of the main treatment class options, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II
receptor antagonists, and calcium-channel blockers, should be maximized. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-
II receptor antagonists, and/or direct renin inhibitors should not be used together due to the risk of
acute renal failure. An optimally dosed thiazide-like diuretic, such as chlorthalidone or indapamide,
should be used over hydrochlorothiazide.[79] In the CLICK trial, in patients with advanced CKD and
poorly controlled hypertension, chlorthalidone therapy improved BP control at 12 weeks compared with
placebo.[139] [140]
The fourth-line drug option is generally spironolactone. Eplerenone can be used as an alternative.
Spironolactone and eplerenone are contraindicated in patients with hyperkalemia. Caution should be
used in patients with renal impairment; either a dose adjustment may be required, or the drug may be
contraindicated depending on the severity of renal impairment, indication for use (i.e., hypertension
versus heart failure), and local guidance. Concomitant administration with potassium-sparing diuretics is
contraindicated.
Otherwise, a fourth- or fifth-line option is a peripheral adrenergic blocker. Hydralazine is a less-preferred
option due to its twice-daily dose requirement and increased risk of edema with simultaneous calcium-
channel blocker treatment. Minoxidil may rarely be indicated in patients with advanced CKD; however, its
use requires some expertise in anticipating and managing adverse effects of fluid retention. Combined
alpha- and beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol, labetalol) are considerations. Additionally, physicians with
expertise in managing difficult-to-control hypertension have had niche success using a combination
of a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker plus a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (e.g.,
amlodipine plus diltiazem). Clonidine is generally avoided because of its adverse effect profile.
The most important principles for managing challenging hypertension are:
1. Promotion of medication adherence using the principle of pill reduction (i.e., use of single pill, fixed-
dose combination formulations or avoidance of twice-daily dose regimens when possible)
2. Maximizing the dose of the diuretic (thiazide or thiazide-like)
3. Use of spironolactone or eplerenone as a fourth drug when possible.[155]
It is also important to question the patient's alcohol use and offer lifestyle counseling; structured diet and
exercise programs can lower BP in patients with resistant hypertension.[156] [157]
Referral to a specialist in hypertension should be considered.

MANAGEMENT
Older adults
In the oldest adult patients, many physicians are reluctant to treat hypertension in accordance with usual
BP goals, for a number of reasons, including concerns about fall risk, drug interactions, adverse effects,
and lack of benefit in mortality reduction. Previous literature reviews and meta-analysis demonstrated
reductions in stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular events in much older adults without reaching
mortality benefit.[158] [159] However, the SPRINT trial found that treating ambulatory adults ages 75
years or older to a systolic BP target of <120 mmHg (as measured by AOBP) resulted in significantly
lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, compared
with a systolic BP target of <140 mmHg.[90] The STEP trial found that treating patients ages 60-80
years to a systolic BP target of 110 to <130 mmHg (measured by trained staff in office, with home BP
measurements also used as an adjunct) had a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than those
treated to a target of 130 to <150 mmHg, but intensive treatment did not have a significant effect on
cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.[87] The SPRINT trial also found that intensive BP control did not
result in any adverse effects on cognition: the risk of mild cognitive impairment and the combined rate
of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia was reduced in patients treated to a systolic BP
target of <120 mmHg; however, the incidence of probable dementia was not reduced.[160] Patients
with orthostasis at enrollment, patients with dementia, and those resident in a nursing home were
excluded from the trial. One meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (including SPRINT) found
that pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults ages over 60 does not worsen cognition, and
may reduce cognitive decline.[161] One Cochrane review assessing whether pharmacologic treatment
of hypertension can prevent cognitive impairment or dementia in people who have no history of
cerebrovascular disease found insufficient evidence.[162] Another meta-analysis found that BP reduction
in patients in late-mid and later life reduced the risk of incident dementia compared with placebo.[163]
One meta-analysis looking at the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on orthostatic hypotension
found that intensive treatment of BP lowers risk of orthostatic hypotension (not raises it), and this finding
was consistent regardless of age.[164] One meta-analysis comparing the effects of BP-lowering treatment
on the risk of major cardiovascular events in groups of patients stratified by age and BP at baseline found
that pharmacologic BP reduction was effective in older adults.[165]
One secondary analysis of randomized controlled trials (including SPRINT, STEP, and ACCORD) found
that the benefit of intensive BP control in adults ages 60 years and over may be most appropriate in those
with a life expectancy of more than 3 years, and that harms may outweigh benefits in those with a life
expectancy of less than 1 year.[166]
The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends a systolic BP goal of <130 mmHg for noninstitutionalized
ambulatory community-dwelling adults. For older adults ≥65 years of age with hypertension, a high
burden of comorbidity, and limited life expectancy, clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-
based approach to assess risk/benefit is reasonable for decisions regarding intensity of BP lowering and
choice of antihypertensive drugs.[2]
European guidelines recommend a BP target of <140/90 mmHg in all patients including independent
older patients and, if treatment is tolerated, a BP target of ≤130/80 mmHg in most patients.[1] UK
guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend a BP target of <150/90
mmHg for patients ages 80 years and over.[67]
Pregnancy
Treatment described in this topic is for nonpregnant patients. Management in pregnancy should be

Implementation success
High levels of hypertension control in large multi-ethnic populations has been demonstrated using basic
principles of implementation science.[167] [168] [169] Core principles include:
1. A comprehensive hypertension registry
2. An evidence-based hypertension treatment algorithm based on single pill combination therapy
3. Free medical assistant visits for blood pressure measurement with follow-up triage, and
4. Team-based care
5. Performance reporting.
Given the large number of patients with hypertension and the use of protocol-based hypertension care
delivery, team-based care incorporating nurses and clinical pharmacists is a key success factor.[170]
[171] In team-based care collaboration, generally the role of the clinical pharmacist involves medication
choice and delivery, and the role of the nurse is patient education. One randomized controlled trial
demonstrated the efficacy of a low-cost, nurse-led email reminder program across a spectrum of
cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid improvement and BP reduction.[172]
The patient should be considered a hypertension team member. The TASMINH4 trial has shown that
self-monitoring, with or without telemonitoring, used by general practitioners (primary care physicians) to
titrate antihypertensive medication in patients with poorly controlled BP, leads to significantly lower BP
compared with titration guided by office readings.[173]
An important goal is to continue to make efforts to improve disparities in BP control among people of
different ancestries.[174]

» ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists may be effective in younger,
especially white patients. A thiazide (or thiazide-
like) diuretic or calcium-channel blocker is
preferred in black people.[2]
» In patients with diabetes who have increased
albumin excretion, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-
II receptor antagonists are recommended. The
Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment
to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study
showed that chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or
lisinopril were co-equal for mild hypertension
in type 2 diabetes.[114] ACE inhibitors are
renoprotective, decreasing the progression of
proteinuria in patients with diabetes.[116]
» Not recommended in pregnancy; therefore,
should generally be avoided in women of
childbearing potential because approximately
half of pregnancies are unplanned, pregnancies
may occur with oral contraceptive use, and
there is a risk of fetopathy when ACE inhibitor
or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist therapy
continues into the second trimester.
» Initial dose of antihypertensive medications
depends on clinical situation; medications are
titrated for a therapeutic effect, while observing
for potential adverse effects. If a low-to-moderate
dose is not effective to reach goal, dose may
be optimized or a second drug added. There is
insufficient evidence about which approach is
superior.
» Once-daily doses may be preferred as
they simplify dosing regimens and improve
adherence.[105]
plus lifestyle and CVD risk factor modification
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» All patients should be given a thorough
explanation of the risks associated with
hypertension and the need for adequate control
and adherence to therapy.
» Lifestyle modifications should be lifelong.[1]

» Guidelines recommend a beta-blocker, ACE
inhibitor, or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist for
patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD)
and hypertension.[1] [2] [127]
» A beta-blocker offers cardioprotective effects
in patients with CCD, decreasing myocardial
wall stress and lessening myocardial oxygen
demand. Different agents vary in lipid solubility,
selectiveness for beta-2 receptors, intrinsic
sympathomimetic activity, and alpha-blocker
activity. Metoprolol and bisoprolol are beta-1
selective, while carvedilol is a combined alpha-
and nonselective beta-blocker.
» Following abrupt cessation of therapy with
certain beta-blockers, exacerbations of angina
pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial
infarction have occurred. All beta-blockers
should be tapered over 1-2 weeks and patients
should be monitored for symptoms of angina.
» Initial dose of antihypertensive medications
depends on clinical situation; medications are
titrated for a therapeutic effect, while observing
for potential adverse effects.
» Many patients with CCD also take nitrates,
which act as an exogenous nitric oxide donor.
Modest reductions in systolic BP can be
observed, but the Food and Drug Administration
has not approved the use of nitrates solely as
antihypertensive therapy.
» Initial dose of antihypertensive medications

concomitant heart failure (HF)
1st guideline-directed medical therapy for HF
» Recommended medications for HF also lower
BP; however, HF guidelines note that clinical
trials assessing the impact of BP reduction on
outcomes in patients with hypertension and HF
are lacking and that the optimal BP goal and
antihypertensive regimen are not known.[131]
[132]
» Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF):
» Treatment of HFrEF (left ventricular EF<40%)
is similar in hypertensive and normotensive
patients. For most patients with HFrEF, a
combination of drugs from the following four
medication classes should be started initially and
continued long-term:[131] [132] 
»  Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
(angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [ARNi],
ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist)
»  Beta-blockers
»  Aldosterone receptor antagonists
(mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists)
»  Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
» Patients who have signs of congestion and
volume overload are also prescribed diuretics.
» Additionally, the combination of hydralazine
and a nitrate (e.g., isosorbide dinitrate/
hydralazine) has been shown to be of benefit for
black patients who have persistent symptoms
despite receiving optimal medical therapy,
as well as in all patients with HF who cannot
receive ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists, or ARNi because of intolerance or
contraindications.[131] [132]
» Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
are not recommended for the treatment of
hypertension in adults with HFrEF.[2]

» Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF):
» HFpEF is defined as symptoms and signs of
heart failure, with left ventricular EF ≥50%.[133]
 Diuretics should be used to control hypertension
in patients with comorbid HFpEF who present
with symptoms of volume overload.[2]
» While optimal BP goal and antihypertensive
regimens are not known for patients with HFpEF,
the American Heart Association (AHA)/American
College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure
Society of America (HFSA) guideline on the
management of HF advises that ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, aldosterone
antagonists, and possibly ARNi could be first-
line agents to control BP, given experience with
their use in HFpEF trials.[131] Similarly, a 2023
expert consensus document from the ACC
suggests that, in addition to diuretics, patients
with hypertension and HFpEF can be treated
with ARNis, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists,
and aldosterone antagonists.[134]
» SGLT2 inhibitors (which have demonstrated
BP-lowering effects) are also now recommended
in the US and European guidelines for all
patients with HFpEF.[131] [134] [135]

differs between guidelines.[1] [2] [4] The
American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American
Heart Association (AHA) defines stage 1
hypertension as BP 130-139/80-89 mmHg.[2]
» ACE inhibitors are first-line therapy for
comorbid renal disease, with angiotensin-II
receptor antagonists as an alternative.[137]
 Continuing ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II
receptor antagonist therapy may be associated
with cardiovascular benefit as kidney function
declines.[138] A dose adjustment may be
required in patients with renal impairment.
» ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists are not recommended in pregnancy
and, therefore, should generally be avoided
in women of childbearing potential because
approximately half of pregnancies are
unplanned, pregnancies may occur with
oral contraceptive use, and there is a risk of
fetopathy when ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II
receptor antagonist therapy continues into the
second trimester.

» Initial dose of antihypertensive medications
depends on clinical situation; medications are
titrated for a therapeutic effect, while observing

» Once-daily doses may be preferred as
they simplify dosing regimens and improve
adherence.[105]
» The 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline for
management of BP in chronic kidney disease
(CKD) recommends that patients with CKD are
treated to a target systolic BP <120 mmHg,
specifying that this should be measured using
standardized office BP measurement, preferably
automated office BP.[137] The ACC/AHA
guideline recommends treating patients with
CKD to a target of <130/80 mmHg.[2]
» Some drugs should be used with caution
in patients with renal impairment and a dose
adjustment may be required. Some drugs may
also be contraindicated in patients with renal
impairment. Consultation with a nephrology
specialist should be considered. See Chronic
kidney disease .

Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» All patients should be given a thorough
explanation of the risks associated with
hypertension and the need for adequate control
and adherence to therapy.
» Lifestyle modifications should be lifelong.[1]

include: sodium reduction (≤1.5 g/day);
potassium supplementation (3.5 to 5.0 g/day),
preferably by consumption of a potassium-rich

refractory/resistant to optimized
triple therapy at any stage
1st individualized therapy
» Managing recalcitrant hypertension requires
expertise. Frequently requiring multiple
antihypertensive agents, patients must be
observed and counseled regarding adverse
effects, medication adherence, potential drug-
drug interactions, and metabolic abnormalities.
Infrequently, patients will require a screen for
secondary causes of hypertension.
» Representative agents of the main treatment
class options, including ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, and calcium-
channel blockers should be maximized. An
optimally dosed thiazide-like diuretic, such as
chlorthalidone or indapamide, should be used
over hydrochlorothiazide.[79] ACE inhibitors and
angiotensin-II receptor antagonists should not
be used together due to the risk of acute renal
failure.
» The fourth-line drug option is generally
spironolactone. Eplerenone can be used as an
alternative. Spironolactone and eplerenone are
contraindicated in patients with hyperkalemia.
Caution should be used in patients with renal
impairment; either a dose adjustment may be
required, or the drug may be contraindicated
depending on the severity of renal impairment,
indication for use (i.e., hypertension versus
heart failure), and local guidance. Concomitant
administration with potassium-sparing diuretics
is contraindicated.
» Otherwise, a fourth- or fifth-line option is a
peripheral adrenergic blocker. Hydralazine is
a less-preferred option due to its twice-daily
dosing requirement and increased risk of edema
with simultaneous calcium-channel blocker
treatment. Minoxidil may rarely be indicated in
patients with advanced chronic kidney disease;
however its use requires some expertise in
anticipating and managing adverse effects
of fluid retention. Combined alpha- and beta-
blockers (e.g., carvedilol, labetalol) are also
considerations. Additionally, physicians with
expertise in managing difficult patients have
had niche success using a combination of a
dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker with
a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker
(e.g., amlodipine plus diltiazem). Clonidine is
generally avoided because of its adverse-effect
profile.

Essential hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
Emerging
Chronotherapy
Studies have investigated whether hypertension therapy taken at bedtime results in improved cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk reduction compared with medication taken upon awakening. The Hygia Chronotherapy
Trial, conducted in primary care, found that hypertensive patients taking ≥1 prescribed blood pressure (BP)-
lowering medications at bedtime had improved ambulatory BP control compared with those who took their
medications upon awakening, and they also had a reduced occurrence of major CVD events.[177] However,
excessive lowering of nocturnal BP with nighttime dosing may increase the potential risk of retinal, cerebral,
and myocardial ischemia, and may lower medication adherence. The Treatment in Morning versus Evening
(TIME) study compared evening and morning dosing of usual antihypertensive medication in participants
followed up for a median of 5.2 years and found no difference between the groups for the primary composite
outcome of vascular death or hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction.[178] One Cochrane review
found very limited data to determine whether evening or morning dosing has more beneficial effects on
cardiovascular outcomes or adverse events.[179] The 2023 European guidelines note that patients have a
choice as to when to take hypertension therapy, but that adherence is generally better in the morning.[63]
The 2024 ESC guidelines conclude that there is no reliable evidence to support bedtime dosing as a superior
strategy and emphasize that patient choice and drug adherence should guide the timing of hypertension
therapy.[1] Preliminary findings from the BedMed and BedMed Frail trials, presented at the 2024 ESC
meeting, reported no significant benefit of bedtime dosing for cardiovascular outcomes. These findings have
not yet been published in peer-reviewed journals.[1] Bedtime dosing may be considered in patients with
documented high nighttime BP.
Renal sympathetic denervation
Activation of renal sympathetic nerves is a component of essential hypertension pathophysiology. Over the
years, renal denervation studies have reported variable efficacy results; however, several randomized, sham-
controlled trials have now shown BP lowering for both radiofrequency and ultrasound renal denervation in
patients with mild-to-moderate, severe, and resistant hypertension.[180] [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186]
[187] [188] [189] [190][191] [192] [193] [194][195] [196] [197]  In November 2023, the US Food and Drug
Administration approved renal denervation as an adjunctive treatment for patients whose BP is inadequately
controlled with lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive drugs.[198] The European guidelines now suggest
that renal denervation may be considered as an adjunctive or alternative treatment option in patients with
uncontrolled and resistant hypertension despite lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, and may also be
an option for those unable to tolerate long-term antihypertensive medication.[63] [199]
Baroreflex activation therapy
Electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreflex system, also known as baroreflex activation therapy
(BAT), may decrease BP in patients with resistant hypertension. Electric stimulators directly activating
afferent baroreflex nerves have previously failed in trials for technical reasons. However, a novel implantable
device may overcome some of the previously experienced technical problems. The device stimulates the
carotid sinus wall and has been shown to reduce BP in feasibility studies.[200] [201] [202] In the Rheos
Pivotal trial, which assessed long-term BP control in resistant-hypertension patients receiving BAT, BP
reduction was maintained over long-term follow-up of 22-53 months.[203]
L-arginine supplementation
Oral supplementation with L-arginine, an amino acid and a substrate of nitric oxide synthase, has been
shown to significantly lower both systolic and diastolic BP.[204]
Vitamin C supplementation
Vitamin C supplementation has been shown to reduce systolic and diastolic BP in short-term trials. Long-
term trials examining the effects of vitamin C supplementation on BP and clinical events are needed.[205]

Essential hypertension Management
Vitamin D supplementation
Data from cross-sectional studies report that low levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D are associated with higher
systolic BP and higher incidence of hypertension.[207] Large observational studies show a weaker, yet
similar, association. This effect is thought to be partly mediated through regulation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone axis.[208] Randomized controlled trials conflict with observational data, probably due to
differences in populations studied, doses of vitamin D used, and unmeasured confounders. One systematic
review found that in studies to date, vitamin D supplementation was ineffective for BP lowering.[209] Large
randomized trials focusing on patients with severe vitamin D deficiency and hypertension are needed before
vitamin D can be recommended for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.
Calcium supplementation
Data indicate that increased calcium intake slightly reduces systolic and diastolic BP in people with normal
BP, particularly young people. This could have implications for prevention and public health, but more and
larger studies are needed.[210]
Amiloride
In the PATHWAY-2 study of resistant hypertension, the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride was shown to
be as effective at reducing BP as spironolactone, suggesting it may be an alternative option for resistant
hypertension.[211]
Baxdrostat
In one phase 2 trial, baxdrostat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, was shown to reduce BP in patients with
resistant hypertension over 12 weeks compared with placebo. Reductions were dose-related.[212]
Lorundrostat
Lorundrostat is an aldosterone synthase inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for high BP. In one
randomized controlled trial of adults with uncontrolled hypertension taking two or more antihypertensive
drugs, use of lorundrostat decreased BP significantly more than placebo and was well tolerated.[213] Further
confirmatory studies are now needed.
Aprocitentan
Aprocitentan is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist that has been approved in the US for the
treatment of hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, to lower BP in adult patients who
are not adequately controlled on other drugs. In one phase 3, multicenter trial (PRECISION), aprocitentan
reduced BP compared with placebo at 4 weeks of treatment.[214]
Zilebesiran
Zilebesiran is an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits synthesis of hepatic
angiotensinogen (the precursor of all angiotensin peptides). One phase 1 study, found that patients receiving
zilebesiran had decreases in serum angiotensinogen and BP that were sustained for up to 24 weeks.[215]
 One phase 2 study found that in adults with mild to moderate hypertension, zilebesiran given across a range
of doses at 3- or 6-month intervals significantly decreased 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic BP at 6 months
compared with placebo.[216]
Primary prevention
The lifetime risk for development of hypertension is high. Efforts should be made to minimize risk factors.
The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline recommends
lifestyle modifications for patients with elevated blood pressure (BP), which is defined as 120 to 129/<80
mmHg, and for people with white coat hypertension.[2] Recommended lifestyle modifications include dietary
changes, smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and reduced alcohol intake.[55] [56]

Essential hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
Population-based approaches to prevent hypertension have been proposed: the American Public Health
Association (APHA) has advocated for reduced sodium in the food supply, particularly in processed
foods.[57] Although sodium reduction has a modest effect on BP lowering, the population effect on the
huge number of at-risk people would potentially have significant consequences for cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality.[58] Use of salt substitutes has demonstrated BP-mediated protective effects for major
cardiovascular events and mortality.[59] [60]
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that adults at increased risk of
cardiovascular disease are offered behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical
activity; those not at high risk may also be considered for behavioral counseling interventions.[61] [62]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for the primary prevention of hypertension taken
from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 Guideline for the prevention,
detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults.[2]
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.

Essential hypertension Management
Elevated blood pressure; defined as a BP of 120-129/<80 mmHg: white coat hypertension;
defined as BP ≥130/80 mmHg but <160/100 mmHg within an office setting but BP <130/80 mmHg
on daytime ambulatory BP monitoring or home BP monitoring.
All
Intervention Goal
Heart healthy dietary pattern; structured
exercise program
Lifestyle modification is recommended for people
with elevated blood pressure and white coat
hypertension.
Heart healthy dietary pattern:
A heart healthy diet, such as the Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is
recommended.
Advise people to consume a diet rich in:
• Fruits
• Vegetables
• Whole grains
• Low-fat dietary products
Advise people to minimize consumption of saturated
and total fat.
Other diets which have been shown to lower BP
include:
• diets that are low in calories from
carbohydrates;
• high-protein diets; and
• the Mediterranean dietary pattern (which
incorporates the basics of healthy eating but
emphasizes consumption of legumes and
monounsaturated fat, avoidance of red meats,
and moderate intake of wine).
Counseling by a nutritionist may be beneficial.
Structured exercise program:
Exercise programs which include elements of the
following have been demonstrated to have the
greatest effects on reducing BP:
• Dynamic aerobic exercise
• Dynamic resistance training
• Static isometric exercise
BP reduction and prevention of progression
to hypertension
Heart healthy dietary pattern:
Expect an approximate average BP decrease of
3 mmHg in those with normotension (with greater
decreases expected with increasing BP levels).
Structured exercise program:
Specific exercise goals are as follows:
• Aerobic exercise: aim for 90-150 minutes/
week, 65%-75% heart rate reserve.
• Dynamic resistance: aim for 90-150 minutes/
week.
• Isometric resistance: aim for 4 × 2 minutes
(hand grip), 1 minutes rest between
exercises, 30%-40% maximum voluntary
contraction, 3 sessions/week for 8-10 weeks.
Expect an approximate average decrease of 2-4
mmHg in those with normotension, depending on
the type of exercise used (with greater decreases
expected with increasing BP levels).
Note: ambulatory BP monitoring or home BP
monitoring is recommended on an annual basis in
order to detect masked hypertension or progression
to overt hypertension.

Essential hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
With overweight (BMI=25-29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Behavioral intervention to support weight
loss; consider pharmacologic or surgical
intervention
Weight loss is a core recommendation and is
recommended through a combination of:
• Reduced calorie intake
• Increased physical activity
For some people, it may be challenging to achieve
and maintain weight loss goals through behavior
change alone.
Pharmacotherapy or minimally invasive and bariatric
surgical procedures may be considered for some
individuals (with the latter typically reserved for
people whose obesity is severe and intractable).
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss and prevention of progression to
hypertension
The best goal is ideal body weight, but aim for at
least a 1 kg reduction in body weight for most adults
who are overweight.
Expect a BP reduction of approximately 1 mmHg for
every 1 kg reduction in body weight; the BP lowering
effect in those with elevated BP is consistent with
the BP lowering effect in those with established
hypertension.
With excessive sodium consumption (≥1500 mg/day)
Intervention Goal
Behavioral intervention to support sodium
reduction
Consider recommending the following strategies:
• Preferentially choosing fresh foods
• Use of food labels to choose foods that are
lower in sodium
• Choice of foods with a ‘no added sodium’
label
• Judicious use of condiments and sodium-
infused foods, with substitution of spices and
low sodium flavorings
• Careful ordering when eating out
• Control of food portion size
• Minimizing use of salt at the table or while
cooking
For some people, it may be challenging to maintain
the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce sodium
intake; however, even a small reduction in sodium
consumption is likely to be safe and beneficial,
especially for people whose BP is salt sensitive.
Dietary counseling by a nutritionist with expertise in
behavior modification can be helpful.
Sodium reduction and prevention of
progression to hypertension
The optimal goal is <1500 mg/day, but aim for at
least a 1000 mg/day reduction in most adults.
Expect a BP reduction of approximately 3 mmHg
in those with normotension (with greater decreases
expected with increasing BP levels, and when
combined with weight loss).

Essential hypertension Management
With suboptimal dietary potassium intake (<3500 mg/day)
Intervention Goal
Behavioral intervention to support increased
dietary potassium
Encourage the consumption of a diet rich in
potassium (unless contraindicated by the presence
of chronic kidney disease [CKD] or use of drugs
which reduce potassium excretion).
Advise people that sources of dietary potassium
include:
• Fruits and vegetables
• Low-fat dairy products
• Selected fish and meats
• Nuts
• Soy products
Advise people that four to five servings of fruits
and four to five servings of vegetables will usually
provide 1500-3000 mg of potassium.
Because potassium-rich diets are typically heart-
healthy, they are preferred over use of pills for
potassium supplementation. Note that the DASH
diet (see above) is high in potassium content.
Dietary potassium increase and prevention of
progression to hypertension
Aim for 3500-5000 mg/day, preferably by
consumption of a diet rich in potassium.
Expect a BP reduction of approximately 2 mmHg
in those with normotension (with greater decreases
expected with increasing BP levels, and in those
consuming a high sodium diet).
With alcohol consumption
Intervention Goal
Advise a moderate alcohol intake
It is reasonable to recommend that patients who
drink alcohol maintain consumption within moderate
levels.
It may be appropriate to advise people that there
is a strong, predictable direct relationship between
alcohol consumption and BP, especially above an
intake of 3 standard drinks per day (approximately
36 ounces of regular beer, 15 ounces of wine, or 4.5
ounces of distilled spirits).
Alcohol intake in keeping with ‘safe drinking’
targets
For people who consume alcohol, advise that
consumption is ≤2 standard drinks daily (men) or ≤1
standard drink daily (women).
In the United States, one standard drink contains
roughly 14 g of pure alcohol, which is typically found
in:
• 12 ounces of regular beer (usually about 5%
alcohol)
• 5 ounces of wine (usually about 12% alcohol)
• 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits (usually about
40% alcohol)
Expect a BP reduction of approximately 3 mmHg
in those with normotension (with greater decreases
expected with increasing BP levels and with greater
levels of initial drinking).

Essential hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
Secondary prevention
Aggressive lifestyle modifications (dietary changes, smoking cessation, increased physical activity, reduced
alcohol intake) should be initiated in patients with pre-hypertension (blood pressure [BP] 120-139/80-89
mmHg) to delay or prevent the onset of overt hypertension. The 2017 American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline defines elevated BP as 120 to 129/<80 mmHg and
recommends lifestyle modification for these patients, which should be reassessed 3-6 months after
initiation.[2] Other cardiovascular risk parameters should be aggressively managed. For example, statins
should be used in accordance with guidelines in people with diabetes. Accordingly, patients with pre-
hypertension or elevated BP should be evaluated for occult cardiovascular risk by screening for diabetes or
dyslipidemia with fasting blood sugar and lipid levels. Global cardiovascular risk should be assessed.
Patient discussions
As with most chronic conditions, hypertension requires a lifelong commitment from both patient and
physician to pursue aggressive management with healthy lifestyle choices and medical therapy.[8]
 Patients should be counseled about diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet, sodium
≤1.5 g/day, in consultation with a nutritionist) and physical activity.[61]
• Smoking raises blood pressure (BP) acutely and transiently, but long-term studies have not
found an association between smoking and the risk of developing chronic hypertension.[248]
Nevertheless, smoking cessation should be encouraged to reduce cardiovascular risk.
• Acute consumption of coffee and black tea has a mild pressor effect; however, long-term studies
have found slightly lower BP in patients who consume caffeine daily.[101] [249] Therefore,
moderate caffeine consumption is acceptable.
• Patients should be advised to begin and maintain aerobic exercise, with a goal of at least 30
minutes of moderate-intensity, dynamic aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming) 5
days per week to total 150 minutes as tolerated or recommended by a physician.
• Medication adherence is important and it should be discussed with patients in whom drug therapy
for hypertension is often a lifelong commitment.[250]
• Regular use of acetaminophen has been associated with increased systolic BP in those with
hypertension; continued regular use in these patients should be reviewed.[78]

Monitoring
Monitoring
While adjusting medication dosage, blood pressure (BP) should be monitored every 2-4 weeks. Once
stabilized, BP should be checked and medications reviewed every 6-12 months. Serum potassium and
creatinine should be checked annually. Patients taking thiazide, thiazide-type diuretics, or aldosterone
antagonists should also have serum sodium checked annually.

Essential hypertension Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
chronic coronary disease long term high
For every 20/10 mmHg increase in blood pressure (BP), there is a lifetime doubling of mortality related
to ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular accident.[235] As with all other associated complications
and comorbid diseases, aggressive BP control, along with therapy specific for the individual condition,
may retard the progression of disease. A longer duration of hypertension has also been associated with
increased risks of cardiovascular disease and overall death in a linear fashion.[236]
cerebrovascular accident long term high
The risk of developing cerebrovascular accident (CVA) varies linearly with blood pressure (BP), and BP
control reduces the risk of recurrent CVA.[236] [237]
left ventricular hypertrophy long term high
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on echocardiography is seen in more than 30% of hypertensive
patients.[241]
Linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[242] LVH patterns vary based on hemodynamic loading
conditions.[243]
congestive heart failure long term medium
Patients with hypertension are 3 times more likely to develop congestive heart failure (systolic or diastolic
dysfunction) than are normotensive patients.[238]
ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and sodium-
glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors confer a mortality benefit. Diuretics do not, but loop diuretics are
frequently used to relieve symptoms of fluid overload.
retinopathy long term medium
Hypertension is associated independently with retinopathy.
Hypertension is also a major risk factor for development of other retinal vascular diseases, such as retinal
vein or artery occlusion, or ischemic optic neuropathy.
peripheral artery disease long term medium
Treatment of hypertension in patients with peripheral artery disease reduces the risk of myocardial
infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure.
chronic kidney disease long term medium
Hypertension is closely associated with the development of renal disease and end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). However, while many hypertensive patients will develop a mild degree of nephrosclerosis, few
progress to ESRD.[244]
A more malignant course of hypertensive kidney disease is seen in black than in white people.[245]

Essential hypertension Follow up
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
aortic dissection long term low
More than 70% of patients with aortic dissection have a history of hypertension.
Despite improved methods of diagnosis and increased awareness, aortic dissection remains associated
with high mortality rates, particularly proximal (type A) dissections.[239] [240]
orthostatic hypotension variable medium
Approximately 10% of adults with hypertension have orthostatic hypotension and the risk increases with
age.[247] Antihypertensive medication should be optimized in these patients; removing antihypertensives
may worsen symptoms. Monitoring for orthostatic hypotension, especially when initiating new treatments in
older patients, may be beneficial.[247]
hypertensive emergency variable low
Undiagnosed or inadequately treated essential hypertension is the most common cause of hypertensive
emergency.[246]
Prognosis
Several trials have shown that uncontrolled hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of cardiac,
vascular, renal, and cerebrovascular disease, morbidity, and mortality. However, even modest reductions
in blood pressure (BP) decrease morbidity and mortality.[2] Systolic BP may have a greater effect on
cardiovascular outcomes, but both systolic and diastolic hypertension have been shown to independently
influence the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.[224] The association between BP and mortality from
cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be sex-specific, with increased CVD mortality seen at lower systolic BP in
women compared with men.[225]
There is currently no randomized controlled trial evidence for the benefit of treating white-coat hypertension.
One meta-analysis found that untreated white-coat hypertension is associated with an increased risk for
cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality; there was no significant association between treated white
coat effect and cardiovascular events or mortality.[226] Preliminary evidence from the ANTI-MASK trial
suggests that treating masked hypertension may reduce target organ damage (TOD). However, the trial
focused on TOD outcomes rather than cardiovascular outcomes, and there are criticisms regarding the
methods, such as the use of electrocardiography instead of echocardiography to assess left ventricular
hypertrophy. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the cardiovascular
benefits of treating masked hypertension.[227] The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart
Association (AHA) guideline notes that masked hypertension and masked uncontrolled hypertension are
associated with an increased prevalence of target organ damage and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke,
and mortality compared with normotensive individuals and those with white coat hypertension.[2] [228] Out-
of-office BP monitoring is critical in the management of hypertension and improving outcomes.
Further studies are needed to confirm optimal BP targets in patients with diabetes. In one randomized
clinical trial (ACCORD), a more stringent BP goal for patients with type 2 diabetes did not significantly reduce
the primary cardiovascular outcome or most secondary outcomes compared with standard BP goals. In
this study, the number of total and nonfatal strokes was lower in the intensive therapy group, although the
clinical benefit was limited (number needed to treat = 89 for 5 years to prevent one stroke).[94] Data from
the ACCORD study and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trials were also used in an analysis to show an
association between BP variability and risk of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes, possibly related to
diastole.[229]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
