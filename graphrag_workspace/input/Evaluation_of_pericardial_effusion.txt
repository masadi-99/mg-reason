Evaluation of pericardial effusion Overview
Summary
Pericardial effusion is present when the fluid in the pericardial space exceeds its physiologic amount (≤50
mL). In the clinical setting, pericardial effusion is relatively common. It may be detected incidentally on a
cardiac or chest imaging study, or manifest on the background of a cardiac or systemic disease.
The significance of effusions lies in their relationship to an underlying disease state and in their potential to
affect a patient's hemodynamics.
Epidemiology
Data from the Framingham cohort suggest that pericardial effusion may be present in up to 6.5% of the
general adult population.[1] Prevalence increased with age, from <1% in patients ages 20 to 30 years to
more than 15% in patients ages 80 years and over. Most people in the study had small effusions and no
recognizable cardiac disease.[1]
In the clinical setting, the prevalence of pericardial effusion depends on the patient population studied. Over
a 6-year period, the mean annual prevalence and incidence of pericardial effusion in an echocardiography
laboratory of a large Italian hospital was 3% and 9%, respectively.[2] In high-risk emergency department
patients, the prevalence of pericardial effusion has been reported in the range of 13% to 20%.[3] One meta-
analysis reported pooled pericardial effusion prevalence of 19.5% across studies that included patients with
pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction, and malignancy.[4]
Pericardial anatomy and physiology
The normal pericardium consists of both fibrous and serous components. The fibrous layer forms a sac that
contains the heart and the roots of the great vessels. The serous part is further divided into a layer that is
adherent to the heart and epicardial fat (epicardium or visceral pericardium) and a layer that lines the internal
surface of the fibrous layer (parietal pericardium). The pericardial space enclosed between the visceral and
the parietal pericardium normally contains up to 50 mL of serous fluid. A pericardial effusion is present when
accumulated fluid in the pericardial space exceeds this physiologic amount.[5]
The pericardium serves as a protective barrier, promotes efficient cardiac function, and prohibits excessive
displacement of the heart.
Under normal conditions, a pericardial reserve volume exists to accommodate physiologic changes in
ventricular filling conditions. However, if this reserve volume is exceeded, pericardial pressure increases
rapidly and significantly limits cardiac filling. The relatively inelastic pericardium is able to stretch under
conditions of chronic stress such as left ventricular dilation or a slowly accumulating pericardial effusion.
However, once the pericardial pressure-volume relationship reaches its noncompliant stage, expansion is
limited and small increases in volume produce a dramatic increase in pericardial pressure, severely impairing
ventricular filling.

Classification of pericardial effusion
Pericardial effusion can be classified by:
• Onset (acute or subacute vs. chronic [when lasting >3 months])
• Distribution (circumferential or loculated)
• Hemodynamic impact (cardiac tamponade or no cardiac tamponade)
• Composition (serous fluid, blood, rarely air, or gas from bacterial infections)
• Size based on a simple semiquantitative echocardiographic assessment.
The size of the effusion on echocardiography indicates the volume of pericardial fluid as follows:[5] [6] [7]
• Trivial (seen only in systole)
• Small (<10 mm), which corresponds to 50-100 mL pericardial fluid
• Moderate (10-20 mm), corresponding to 100-500 mL pericardial fluid
• Large (>20 mm), corresponding to >500 mL pericardial fluid
• Very large (>25 mm); usually indicates >700 mL pericardial fluid.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Theory
THEORY
Etiology
The most common causes of pericardial effusion include malignancy (25% to 32%), infection (7% to 24%),
and iatrogenic (15% to 21%). In addition, a substantial proportion of pericardial effusions is considered
idiopathic (16% to 26%).[8] [9] [10]
Etiology varies between populations and is affected by factors such as demographic characteristics, clinical
settings, or geographic distribution. For example, tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of pericardial
effusion in endemic regions, and especially in areas where coinfection with HIV is common, but is a rare
cause of pericardial effusion in developed countries.[11]
Malignancy
Malignant effusions
• Malignant pericardial effusion is a common and serious manifestation of cancer.[12]
• Most malignant pericardial effusions are caused by solid tumors, including lung cancer and breast
cancer, or hematologic malignancies such as lymphoma or leukemia. Lung cancer is the most
common malignancy involving the pericardium, in both men and women.[13]
• The effusion may result from direct local tumor extension to the pericardium, hematogenous or
lymphangitic tumor spread, or mediastinal lymphatic drainage obstruction.[13]
• In patients with malignancy, pericardial effusion is most likely to be malignant. Occasionally, pericardial
effusion is the first manifestation of malignancy. Therefore, malignancy should be excluded in patients
with pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade at presentation, with rapidly accumulating pericardial
effusion, and/or with a persistent or recurrent course.[12]
• Accumulation of pericardial fluid may be gradual, or rapid if erosion into the pericardial blood vessels
occurs.
Effusion associated with antineoplastic therapies
• Antineoplastic therapies such as anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and all-trans retinoic
acid are associated with pericardial effusion.[14]
• There is increasing evidence that immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with pericardial effusion
and cardiac tamponade.[15]
Infectious
Viral
• Viral pericarditis rarely produces effusions large enough to cause tamponade, but it can be associated
with constrictive physiology.
• Causes of viral pericarditis include Coxsackie virus, echovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
cytomegalovirus (CMV), and parvovirus-B19.[16]
• In 259 patients with moderate to large pericardial effusions, polymerase chain reaction detected
viral genomes (including parvovirus-B19, EBV, human herpes virus [HHV]-6, CMV, hepatitis C and
influenza) in 51 (19.7%) of patients.[17]
• The clinical course of pericardial effusion associated with viral pericarditis is usually self-limited and
benign.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Theory
• Bacterial pericarditis is a life-threatening condition that presents as an acute febrile illness and is
commonly complicated by cardiac tamponade.
• Purulent pericarditis is the most serious manifestation of bacterial pericarditis, with purulent fluid,
ranging from a thin layer to large quantities of gross pus, accumulating in the pericardial space.[18]
• The most likely causes of bacterial pericarditis include  Staphylococcus aureus  (typically
hematogenous spread) and  Streptococcus pneumoniae  (often direct extension from an adjacent
pneumonia).[19]
• Patients at higher risk for bacterial pericarditis include those on dialysis, immunosuppressed
people, people dependent on alcohol, and people who have recently had cardiac surgery.
Tuberculous
• Tuberculous pericarditis is responsible for less than 5% of cases in developed countries, but is one of
the leading causes of pericarditis in developing countries, especially in areas where HIV infection is
common.[20]
• Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of pericardial diseases in Africa. Patients with
tuberculous pericarditis present with effusive pericarditis (approximately 80%) or effusive-constrictive
pericarditis (15%); up to 20% of patients with tuberculous pericarditis present with cardiac
tamponade.[21]
• An increased level of adenosine deaminase (ADA) >40 units/L in pericardial effusion is 93% sensitive
and 90% to 97% specific for TB.[22] [23]
Fungal
• Fungal pericarditis is rare, but cases of pericardial effusion or tamponade associated with fungal
infection have been reported.[24]
• Fungal pericarditis in immune-competent individuals has been documented in endemic areas for 
Histoplasma capsulatum and  Coccidioides immitis . In patients with immune deficiency, candidiasis,
aspergillosis, and blastomyces infections are the major fungal pathogens.[25] [26]
Parasitic
• Chagas disease caused by  Trypanosoma cruzi , which is endemic in Latin America, is the most
common parasitic infection that involves the heart.
• Chagas myocarditis is rare, but pericardial effusion is common (42%) when it occurs.[27]
Iatrogenic
Post cardiac surgery
• Postsurgery pericardial effusion has been reported in up to three-quarters of patients undergoing
cardiac surgery.[28] [29]
• The effusion tends to reach its maximum size around day 10 postoperatively, after which it usually
resolves without intervention. However, postcardiac surgery effusions can also persist or progress and
ultimately lead to cardiac tamponade (approximately 4% of patients).[30]
• Postcardiac surgery pericardial effusion is more likely to be loculated (50% of posterior effusions)
compared with pericardial effusion of other etiologies, and therefore less accessible for
pericardiocentesis.[31]

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Theory
THEORY
• Early postoperative cardiac tamponade is caused by bleeding, while late cardiac tamponade is
commonly related to postpericardiotomy syndrome (an inflammatory response of the pericardium to
the surgical procedure). However, postoperative infection must always be considered.
• Pericardial constriction post surgery is rare, and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.
Although reported data are not entirely consistent, evidence suggests a relationship with prior
postpericardiotomy syndrome.[32]
Post cardiac intervention
• The incidence of percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI)-related effusions has increased significantly
in recent decades, consistent with the increase in the frequency of coronary intervention, and
newer interventional techniques such as atrial fibrillation ablation, left atrial appendage closure, and
transcatheter valve replacement.
• Some of these procedures require intraprocedural anticoagulation and/or transseptal puncture, which
increase the risk of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.
• The incidence of pericardial complications has been reported as <0.5% after PCI, <1.5% after atrial
fibrillation ablation, and 1% to 5% for pacemaker insertion.[33]
Idiopathic
• A pericardial effusion is considered idiopathic once thorough evaluation does not result in a diagnosis.
• It is generally assumed that most cases are due to viral infection, either acute or chronic.
• As in viral pericarditis, patients generally present with features typical of acute pericarditis and
experience a self-limited, benign course.
• However, idiopathic effusions may persist, recur, and, when large, progress to tamponade.[34]
Cardiac
Congestive heart failure
• Transudative pericardial effusion is not uncommon in congestive heart failure; however, cardiac
tamponade is not a recognized complication.[35]
• In a small study of patients with heart failure requiring diuresis, 20% had a small or moderate
pericardial effusion. More than 90% of these patients were found to also have pleural effusion.[35]
• In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the presence of pericardial effusion is an indicator of
right heart failure. Its persistence despite vasoactive therapy is associated with poor prognosis.[36]
Aortic dissection
• Pericardial effusion is a common complication of acute type A aortic dissection.
• The dissected aorta can rupture directly into the pericardial space, resulting in cardiac tamponade.
• Cardiac tamponade is diagnosed in <20% of patients presenting with acute type A aortic dissection,
and is associated with an approximately two- to three-fold increase in in-hospital mortality in this
patient population.[37] [38] [39] [40] Presence of cardiac tamponade mandates urgent aortic repair.[38]
Post-myocardial infarction syndrome
• Also known as Dressler phenomenon, this condition is caused by the development of antibodies to
heart antigens following myocardial infarction (MI). Patients develop fever and chest discomfort in the
weeks or months following an infarct.[41]

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Theory
• The occurrence of pericardial effusion after MI has been declining in the era of primary percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI).
• A study of 1732 patients with ST-segment elevation MI treated with primary PCI demonstrated a 14.2%
occurrence rate of pericardial effusion assessed by echocardiography.[42]
• Pericardial effusion in the setting of acute MI may represent contained left ventricular free wall rupture
that can progress to cardiac tamponade and sudden cardiac death.[43]
Traumatic
• Direct penetrating injuries of the heart are usually the result of stab wounds or gunshots and have a
high prehospital mortality.
• For patients who reach a hospital, emergency department echocardiography is 96% accurate in the
diagnosis of traumatic effusion.[44]
Renal
• Pericardial effusion in renal disease can occur due to uremic pericarditis or dialysis pericarditis. The
latter may be associated with inadequate dialysis and/or fluid overload.
• In a study of 44 patients with uremic pericardial effusion, echocardiography showed small, moderate,
and large effusions in 38%, 32%, and 30% of patients, respectively. Tamponade signs were observed
in 16% of patients.[45]
Radiation-related
• In the course of radiation therapy for thoracic malignancies, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, breast
cancer, or lung cancer, the heart and pericardium may be exposed to high doses of radiation.
• Advances in radiation oncology, including better shielding strategies, have resulted in a decreasing
occurrence of radiation-associated pericarditis and pericardial effusion.[46]
• Pericarditis related to radiation may be acute or delayed. Chronic pericardial effusion is one of the
delayed complications after radiation therapy.[47]
• In a study of patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing radiation therapy, the cumulative
incidence rates of pericardial effusion were 31% at 1 year and 45% at 2 years, with a median time to
pericardial effusion of 9 months.[48]
• The underlying mechanisms are thought to be impaired ability of the venous and lymphatic system of
the heart to drain fluid, resulting in a pericardial effusion of either hemorrhagic or serous composition
with a fibrin-rich exudate.[47]
Amyloidosis
• Pericardial effusion was reported in approximately 50% of patients with cardiac amyloidosis (including
acquired monoclonal light-chain, hereditary transthyretin, and senile amyloidosis).[49]
• In all but a few cases, the size of the effusion is small or moderate and cardiac tamponade is rare.
Systemic inflammatory diseases
• Pericardial disease is common in many connective tissue diseases, but especially in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE).

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Theory
THEORY
• Pericardial effusion is the most common echocardiographic finding in SLE. Pericardial effusion occurs
in >50% of patients and it is usually asymptomatic.[50] Large effusion or cardiac tamponade is rare.
• Pericardial effusion and pericarditis have been reported in patients with IgG4-related disease.[51] [52]
Endocrine
Hypothyroidism
• Pericardial effusions are most commonly found in states of severe hypothyroidism. Most are
asymptomatic, even if large (up to 30% of cases).[53]
• Typically, effusions resolve within weeks to months following institution of hormone replacement
therapy.
Ovarian hyperstimulation
• In a Belgian multicenter study, the occurrence of pericardial effusion was 3% in patients with ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome.[54]
• Development of cardiac tamponade is a very rare, but life‐threatening, complication of ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome.[55]
Drug-induced
• Hydralazine, procainamide, and isoniazid are the most common drugs associated with drug-induced
lupus erythematosus, causing pericarditis and pericardial effusion.[56]
• Antineoplastic drugs can also be associated with pericardial effusion.[14]
• Typically, the disease and its manifestations resolve following cessation of the offending agent and
cardiac tamponade is extremely rare.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Emergencies
Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
Cardiac tamponade
Cardiac tamponade occurs when pericardial pressure increases and limits cardiac filling.
The clinical presentation and the hemodynamic effect of cardiac tamponade depend on the size of
the pericardial effusion, the time over which the fluid accumulated, and the clinical circumstances. It
encompasses a hemodynamic spectrum from trivial compression with minimal effects on cardiac output to
fatal cardiovascular collapse.
When pericardial fluid accumulates rapidly, impaired cardiac filling quickly progresses to cardiogenic
shock followed by pulseless electrical activity. Causes of acute tamponade include chest trauma, chamber
perforation during transcutaneous cardiac procedure, or type A aortic dissection. Symptoms include dyspnea
and chest pain.
Examination findings suggestive of cardiac tamponade include:[6]
• Tachycardia
• Tachypnea
• Hypotension
• Elevated jugular venous pressure
• Distended neck veins
• Kussmaul sign (a rise in venous pressure with inspiration)
• Pulsus paradoxus.
ECG may show low QRS voltages and electrical alternans (alternating QRS amplitude in any lead, caused by
the heart swinging in the pericardial sac).
Urgent echocardiography is indicated to establish the effusion size, location, and hemodynamic effect.[6]
The treatment of tamponade is emergency drainage of the pericardial fluid using needle pericardiocentesis.
Pericardiocentesis is performed under echocardiographic guidance. Surgical drainage may be indicated in
cases of hemopericardium due to trauma, type A aortic dissection, or ventricular free wall rupture following
myocardial infarction.[57]

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
The evaluation of pericardial effusion entails:
• Diagnosing pericardial effusion with clinical history and exam; confirmed by imaging
• Assessing the hemodynamic significance of the effusion
• Determining etiology by clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory investigations.
Clinical assessment
The following signs and symptoms should prompt further evaluation for pericardial effusion:
• Otherwise unexplained chest discomfort, pleuritic pain, and dyspnea.[16] Acute pericarditis
typically causes sharp, pleuritic chest pain, which is improved by sitting up and leaning forward and
exacerbated by coughing and lying supine.[6] The pain may radiate to the trapezius ridge which, like
the pericardium, is innervated by the phrenic nerve.[58]
• Patients who have any systemic disorder known to involve the pericardium and a raised jugular venous
pressure.[5]
• Unexplained cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray.[5]
• Chest pain and/or hemodynamic instability after recent blunt trauma to the chest, cardiac surgery, or
cardiac intervention.
• Cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity or asystole.
Timing
Onset of symptoms is typically subacute. Symptoms may develop acutely if effusion is related to trauma, free
wall rupture, iatrogenic causes, or aortic dissection.
Associated symptoms
• Patients with viral pericarditis often have an abrupt onset of symptoms and other features of a viral
illness, such as cough and sore throat. A low-grade fever is common, but a fever >100°F (>38°C) is
not typical and should prompt consideration of bacterial pericarditis.
• Symptoms suggesting tuberculosis include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, cough, and
hemoptysis.
• Fatigue, arthralgia, photosensitive rash, alopecia, and oral ulcers suggest systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE).[59]
• Cold intolerance, fatigue, constipation, decreased memory, dry skin, weight gain, depression,
oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, and reduced scalp and body hair may occur in hypothyroidism.
Past medical history
• Previous myocardial infarction (MI). Pericardial effusion following MI (post-myocardial infarction
syndrome or Dressler phenomenon) is a rare complication that can occur in the weeks or months
following an MI.
• Recent cardiac surgery or intervention. Post-cardiac surgery effusion occurs in up to 85% of
patients.[60] These patients are also at higher risk of bacterial pericarditis.
• Chronic heart failure. There may be a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, valvular
disease, or cardiomyopathy. Symptoms include dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, orthopnea,
and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Diagnosis
• Chronic renal failure, particularly if the patient is dependent on dialysis. These patients are also at
higher risk of bacterial pericarditis. Symptoms of uremia include nausea, vomiting, and mental status
changes.
• History of malignancy, particularly lung cancer, breast cancer, hematologic malignancies, and
mesothelioma. Metastatic infiltration of the pericardium and radiation therapy can cause pericardial
effusion.
• Secondary amyloidosis can develop in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as
bronchiectasis, osteomyelitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
• Pericardial effusions may occur in severe hypothyroidism.
• Immunosuppression increases susceptibility to bacterial, fungal, and tuberculous pericarditis.
Drug history
• Hydralazine, procainamide, and isoniazid are the most common drugs identified as a cause of drug-
induced lupus erythematosus.[56]
• Chemotherapy drugs such as anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, all-trans retinoic acid,
and immune checkpoint inhibitors are all associated with pericardial effusion.[14]
• Pericardial effusion may occur in patients with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome following
administration of injectable gonadotropins.[54]
Exam
Physical exam may be normal if the patient does not have hemodynamic compromise.
Exam findings suggestive of pericardial effusion include:
• Pericardial friction rub: a high-pitched scratching sound best heard over the left sternal border with the
patient leaning forward at end-expiration.[6] Rubs may be 1, 2, or 3 parts, corresponding to the periods
of greatest heart movement in the cardiac cycle. The pericardial friction rub may also be transient, and
thus it is useful to examine patients suspected of pericarditis on multiple occasions.
• Distant heart sounds with a quiet precordium is a common finding in pericardial effusion.
• Pulsus paradoxus: a decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration of >12 mmHg has a
sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 83% for the detection of tamponade.[61]
• In cardiac tamponade, the accumulating pericardial effusion has a restrictive effect on the filling
of the heart, which results in a more pronounced and interdependent respiratory variation in
the right and left ventricular filling and an inspiratory drop of the systolic arterial pressure of 10
mmHg or more.
• To measure pulsus paradoxus, the blood pressure cuff is inflated above systolic blood pressure.
The cuff is deflated slowly, listening for the first Korotkoff sound, which will be intermittent and
heard during quiet expiration. The difference (in mmHg) between this first Korotkoff sound and
the pressure at which a Korotkoff sound is heard with each beat is the pulsus paradoxus.
Pericardial constriction may produce similar examination findings to tamponade with pulsus paradoxus and
elevated jugular venous pressure. A pericardial knock may be evident during palpation and/or auscultation,
and constriction is also often associated with gross liver enlargement and ascites.

Imazio M. Pericardial involvement in systemic inflammatory diseases. Heart 2011;97:1882-92.
Electrocardiography
Patients with suspected pericardial effusion should have an electrocardiogram. ECG changes include:
• Sinus tachycardia.
• Low QRS voltage.
• Electrical alternans. This occurs when the heart's swinging motion in the pericardial fluid results in
beat-to-beat variation of the ventricular, and occasionally the atrial, axis on the ECG.
When inflammation involves the epicardium, such as in acute pericarditis, the ECG may show diffuse ST-
segment elevation and PR depression signaling generalized epicardial injury. Up to 60% of patients with
acute pericarditis have typical ECG findings.[62]

Imaging
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography is the investigation of choice for a suspected pericardial effusion. It is a
noninvasive and effective diagnostic modality. As well as confirming the diagnosis, echocardiography allows
the operator to evaluate the size and hemodynamic effects of the effusion.[7]
An echo-free space between the two layers of the pericardium indicates the presence of an effusion.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Transesophageal echocardiography can be helpful to diagnose loculated and complex effusions and in cases
where transthoracic echocardiography is inconclusive.
Chest radiography
A chest x-ray may show a water-bottle-shaped cardiac silhouette with a distinct pericardial fat stripe,
suggesting a large pericardial effusion. Pleural effusions may also be present.

bottle-shaped cardiac silhouette with a distinct, fat, pericardial fat stripe
From the collection of Dr Rajdeep Khattar
Computed tomography
Transthoracic echocardiography has limited spatial resolution and cannot reliably visualize the pericardium,
unless there is pronounced thickness (>5 mm; normal thickness of 0.5 to 1.0 mm). Cardiac computed
tomography (CT) has higher spatial resolution and is therefore more reliable in detecting an abnormally
thickened pericardium (defined as >2 mm). It can provide quantitative and qualitative information on
pericardial effusion and is the most sensitive imaging modality to detect pericardial calcification.
Owing to its high spatial resolution, cardiac CT is most helpful in providing anatomic information and for
the planning of pericardiotomy or surgical drainage of loculated or complex effusions. High attenuation
fluid suggests hemopericardium, particularly in cases of trauma, postsurgical effusion, or aortic dissection.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Diagnosis
Nodularity of the pericardium may indicate malignancy.[63] CT angiography is the preferred test to diagnose
aortic dissection in hemodynamically stable patients.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most comprehensive modality to assess the
pericardium.[6] [64] [65][66] It allows qualitative and quantitative assessment of pericardial effusion.
Transudative pericardial effusions appear dark on T1-weighted sequences; exudative effusions are of low to
medium intensity on T1 and medium to bright on T2-weighted sequences.[66] [67][68] Hemorrhagic effusions
are bright on T1- and T2-weighted sequences, but they can evolve to a chronic hematoma (>15 days) with
low signal intensity.[66] [67] Proteinaceous effusions are bright on T1-weighted sequences.[66] [67]
Cardiac MRI can detect abnormally thickened pericardium on T1-weighted black-blood sequences (<4
mm is considered normal), and constrictive physiology (e.g., respirophasic septal shift).[6][65] [66] [67]
 Delayed gadolinium enhancement can provide important information on the presence and grade of ongoing
pericardial inflammation and therefore guide anti-inflammatory therapies.[65] [66][67]
Note that cardiac MRI sequences are susceptible to cardiac motion artifacts that can obscure or be
misinterpreted as pathology.[69]
Laboratory evaluation
In 60% of cases, a pericardial effusion is due to a known underlying disease or condition.[70] Thus, all
patients require a thorough history and physical exam.
If an underlying cause is not identified, initial testing includes inflammatory markers. Raised inflammatory
markers support a diagnosis of acute idiopathic pericarditis, severe effusions without inflammatory signs are
associated with chronic idiopathic pericarditis, and tamponade without inflammatory signs is associated with
malignancy.[70]
Initial tests
• Complete blood count: leukocyte count is typically mildly elevated in acute idiopathic pericarditis; a
substantially elevated leukocyte count may suggest bacterial pericarditis.[58]
• Serum C-reactive protein: is elevated in most cases of acute pericarditis and so may not be helpful in
determining the underlying etiology. However, it is useful for monitoring the response to treatment and
is recommended for all patients with suspected acute pericarditis.[6]
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: is often elevated in acute pericarditis.
• Blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, and creatinine: may demonstrate uremia in chronic kidney disease,
or acute kidney injury if there is an acute infection, trauma, or lupus nephritis.
• Troponin: performed to detect concomitant myocarditis. The magnitude of elevation correlates with the
extent of ST-segment elevation. Levels may be in the range considered diagnostic of an acute MI in
some patients. Levels return to normal within 1 to 2 weeks of diagnosis. Elevated levels do not appear
to confer prognostic significance in acute pericarditis.
• Coagulation studies.
Further blood tests may be indicated depending on the suspected etiology of the effusion.
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone: elevated in hypothyroidism.

Evaluation of pericardial effusion Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and anti-Smith antibody: suspected
SLE.
• Antihistone antibodies: suspected drug-induced lupus.
• Serum and urine immunoglobulins: suspected amyloidosis.
• Blood cultures: essential when bacterial pericarditis is suspected, to identify causative organisms.
Viral cultures for cytomegalovirus may be ordered in selected immunocompromised patients. In other
circumstances there is little clinical utility in ordering them, as most cases of viral pericarditis are
benign and self-limited, and a positive test would not change management.[71]
• HIV: order when evidence of immunosuppression is present on exam, or the patient has risk factors for
HIV infection.
• Thick blood smear for microscopy: if Chagas disease is suspected.
Pericardiocentesis
Pericardial fluid sampling can include Gram and acid-fast bacilli stains and cultures, polymerase chain
reaction, tuberculosis-specific testing (e.g., adenosine deaminase, lysozyme, and gamma-interferon), tumor
markers, and cytology, and may be useful in the following scenarios:
• Suspected purulent or tuberculous pericarditis
• Suspected malignant pericardial effusion
• Moderate to large pericardial effusion in patients with HIV and/or immune suppression
• Moderate to large or progressive pericardial effusion in patients not responding to initial therapy and
when diagnostic workup is inconclusive.[72]
Cytologic evaluation is the gold standard for diagnosis of neoplastic pericardial effusion, with a sensitivity of
71% to 92% and a specificity approaching 100%.[13]
Contrary to common practice, and unlike pleural effusion evaluation, differentiating between an exudate
and transudate based on cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and protein and glucose levels is not generally
helpful for the differential diagnosis and management of patients with pericardial effusion.[73]
Pericardial biopsy
Pericardial biopsy may be considered in the course of surgical drainage, when large effusions recur
without a previous diagnosis, and when tuberculous or malignant etiologies are suspected.[6] Although
the diagnostic yield is historically low and complicated by a high degree of false-negative results, recent
advances in pericardioscopy, which allows direct visualization of the pericardium, have improved the yield
(40% diagnostic yield) and reduced the incidence of false-negative findings (6.7% false-negatives).[74]

The combination
of serum protein
electrophoresis
with immunofixation
(SPIE), urine protein
electrophoresis with
immunofixation (UPIE),
and quantification of
serum free light-chains
has a sensitivity of 99%
for identifying abnormal
pro-amyloidotic
precursor in light-
chain amyloidosis
(AL).[77] Therefore,
this screening test is
highly sensitive for AL
amyloidosis and is very
helpful in suggesting
the diagnosis of cardiac
amyloid when it is
clinically suspected.[77]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,

Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
