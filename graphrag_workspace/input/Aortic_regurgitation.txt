Aortic regurgitation Overview
Summary
Aortic regurgitation (AR) can be caused by primary disease of the aortic valve leaflets or dilation of the aortic
root. It may develop acutely (acute AR) or over decades (chronic AR).
Chronic AR may be asymptomatic for years until overt symptoms of congestive heart failure develop. Initial
symptoms can include palpitations and uncomfortable awareness of the pounding heart when lying on the
left side.
Acute AR is a medical emergency, presenting with sudden onset of pulmonary edema and hypotension or
cardiogenic shock. May also present as myocardial ischemia or aortic root dissection.
Echocardiography is the best noninvasive test to diagnose and grade the severity of AR.
Vasodilator therapy improves hemodynamics and delays the need for aortic valve replacement/repair (AVR)
in asymptomatic patients with chronic severe AR.
AVR is indicated in symptomatic patients or asymptomatic patients with LV ejection fraction (EF) ≤55%.
AVR could also be considered for asymptomatic patients with severe AR and LVEF >55% and if LV end-
systolic diameter is >50 mm (>25 mm/m²).
Definition
Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the diastolic leakage of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. It occurs due
to inadequate coaptation of valve leaflets resulting from either intrinsic valve disease or dilation of the aortic
root. It can remain asymptomatic for decades before patients present with irreversible myocardial damage.

Aortic regurgitation Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
AR is not as common as aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. One US study showed a prevalence of 13%
in men and 8.5% in women with most being trace or mild; a prevalence of 15.6% was reported in African-
Americans.[3] Prevalence increases with age in both sexes.[4] Prevalence of moderate to severe AR has
been estimated to be about 0.5% of the total US population.[5]
Data from a large registry show that both men and women have equal proportion of different morphologic
types of bicuspid aortic valve, but men tend to present with moderate to severe AR while women tend to
present more commonly with moderate to severe aortic stenosis.[6]
Etiology
AR can be caused by primary disease of the aortic valve leaflets or dilation of the aortic root. In developing
countries rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause, but congenital bicuspid aortic valve and aortic
root dilation account for most of the cases in developed countries.[1] Causes of aortic root dilation include
Marfan syndrome, related connective tissue diseases, and aortitis secondary to syphilis, Behcet, Takayasu,
reactive arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitis. Endocarditis can lead to rupture of leaflets or even paravalvular
leaks. Vegetations on the valvular cusps can also cause inadequate closure of leaflets, resulting in leakage
of blood.[7] Aortic root dissection is a cause of acute AR.
AR may develop acutely (acute AR) or over a period of many years in progressively increasing severity
(chronic AR). An analysis of the causes of AR in patients >20 years of age undergoing isolated aortic valve
replacement/repair (AVR) in a single US tertiary center from 1993-2005, found nonvalvular causes accounted
for 54% of cases and valvular causes for 46%. Acute AR was responsible for only 18% of AVR, and, of
these, 56% resulted from active infective endocarditis and 44% from aortic dissection. Aortic enlargement
from unclear etiology was the most common cause of chronic AR, accounting for 34% of the total, followed
by bicuspid congenital malformation (22% of total). Older patients most commonly had an unclear etiology.[8]
The role of systemic hypertension in aortic root dilation leading to AR is a frequent source of debate. Aortic
root diameter at the supra-aortic ridge, which is the site of commissural attachment, is significantly greater in
hypertensive patients than in age- and sex-matched normotensive patients.[9]

Causes of AR

Pathophysiology
AR can present acutely or over decades.
Acute AR is a medical emergency with high mortality and results in an acute rise in left atrial pressure,
pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock.
During acute AR:
• End-diastolic pressure in the left ventricle rises sharply.
• The heart tries to compensate by increasing the heart rate and increasing the contractility (Starling's
law) to keep up with the increased preload, but this is insufficient to maintain the normal stroke volume
and fails.
Chronic progressive AR results in:
• Both left ventricular volume and pressure overload.
• An increase in left ventricular volume and pressure causes an increase in wall tension.
• According to Laplace's law, wall tension is directly proportional to the product of cavity pressure and
radius, and inversely proportional to wall thickness.
• To compensate for the increased wall tension, the heart wall undergoes hypertrophy. Both concentric
and eccentric hypertrophy can occur but most are eccentric. Eccentric hypertrophy, in which
sarcomeres are laid down in series, results from volume overload; concentric hypertrophy, in which
sarcomeres replicate in parallel, results from pressure overload from increased systolic pressure to
normalize the end-systolic stress.[10]

Aortic regurgitation Theory
THEORY
• Systolic hypertension occurs secondary to increased stroke volume, which combines both regurgitant
and forward stroke volume.
• The volume overload, which is directly related to the severity of the leak, results in an increase in left
ventricular end-diastolic volume.
• End-diastolic pressure remains normal due to an increase in ventricular compliance resulting from
increased cavity size.
In chronic AR, most patients remain asymptomatic for decades, as the left ventricle maintains forward stroke
volume with compensatory chamber enlargement and hypertrophy. Eventually, the left ventricular systolic
dysfunction supervenes and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rises resulting in symptomatic congestive
heart failure. Timing AVR before irreversible myocardial dysfunction develops is of critical importance.
Classification
Acute aortic regurgitation: clinically accepted criteria
A medical emergency where the left heart rapidly decompensates due to its inability to handle a sudden
increase in end-diastolic volume. Most commonly it results from aortic dissection or endocarditis and, in rare
cases, trauma.
Chronic aortic regurgitation: clinically accepted criteria
Chronic regurgitation has a prolonged course over a period of months to years. The left ventricle is able to
compensate for volume overload initially but then decompensates with the appearance of clinical symptoms
of congestive heart failure.
Case history
Case history #1
A 55-year-old white man presents with weakness, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion. On physical
exam, his blood pressure is 148/50 mmHg with a bounding pulse and an early diastolic murmur over the
left sternal border. He denies any history of drug abuse, rheumatic fever, or connective tissue disorder.
The patient is taking hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure. Echocardiography reveals a left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 70 mm, and end-
systolic diameter of 50 mm.
Case history #2
A 31-year-old black man presents to clinic for the first time for a routine physical exam. He denies any
complaints. On physical exam the only abnormality is a systolic murmur best heard over the second right
intercostal space and an early diastolic murmur best heard over the third left sternal border. LVEF is 55%
to 60% with mild LV hypertrophy. Left ventricular end-systolic diameter is 45 mm and aortic root diameter
is 3.5 cm.

Other presentations
In acute AR, patients can present with sudden onset of pulmonary edema and hypotension or in
cardiogenic shock. Patients may also present with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia or aortic
root dissection.[1] Due to the acute nature of the AR, there may be no increase in left ventricular size,
and the diastolic murmur may be short and/or soft due to diastolic pressure equilibrium between aorta
and ventricle occurring before the end of diastole. Pulse pressure may not be increased due to reduced
systolic pressure.[2]

Aortic regurgitation Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
AR is usually detected on clinical exam with a diastolic murmur, or incidentally during echocardiogram
evaluation for other causes. ECG, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram are routinely performed for all patients
with features of AR.
Acute AR: clinical presentation
The patient can present with sudden onset of pulmonary edema and hypotension or in cardiogenic shock.
Patients may also present with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia or aortic root dissection.[1]
When valvular regurgitation is acute, many of the characteristic findings of chronic AR are absent and the
severity of the problem may be underestimated. For example, during the physical exam, no increase in left
ventricular (LV) size may be detected and the diastolic murmur may be short and/or soft due to diastolic
pressure equilibrium between aorta and ventricle occurring before the end of diastole. Pulse pressure
may not be increased due to reduced systolic pressure.[2]
Signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema
• Dyspnea
• Pink frothy sputum
• Pale and sweaty
• Basal lung crepitations
• Wheeze (cardiac asthma).
Signs and symptoms of cardiogenic shock
• Pale and/or cyanotic, cool to touch with mottled extremities
• Evidence of hypoperfusion with altered mental status and decreased urine output
• Rapid and faint peripheral pulses
• Jugular venous distension
• Third and fourth heart sounds may be present
• Arrhythmias
• Dyspnea.
Myocardial ischemia, due to decreased perfusion pressure in acute severe AR, classically presents with
central crushing chest pain radiating to the jaw or left arm. Aortic root dissection classically presents with
chest pain radiating to the back.
Acute AR: investigation and imaging
ECG
• Determines any arrhythmias and the rate of tachycardia. It will also rule out or diagnose myocardial
ischemia or infarction.
Chest x-ray
• May not show cardiomegaly, which is a characteristic finding for chronic AR. There may be
evidence of pulmonary edema with bilateral basal shadowing, pleural effusions at costophrenic
angles, and fluid in the lung fissures.
Transthoracic echocardiogram
• One of the best noninvasive diagnostic tests to evaluate the valvular diseases.[16]

Aortic regurgitation Diagnosis
• Confirms the presence and severity of the valvular regurgitation, assesses LV size (which is usually
normal) and systolic function, and determines a cause.
Transoesophageal echocardiogram
• Performed if aortic root dissection is suspected: classically, patients have chest pain that radiates to
the back.[1]
Chronic AR: clinical symptoms
Patients have a protracted course and remain asymptomatic for decades. LV systolic dysfunction often
precedes the development of symptoms. Patients may remain asymptomatic with normal exercise
tolerance even with chronic severe AR due to LV compensation.
Initial symptoms may include uncomfortable awareness of the pounding heart when lying on the left side,
due to closer contact of the enlarged LV with the chest wall.[10] Palpitations occur frequently, secondary
to premature ventricular contractions. These symptoms may persist for years before exercise intolerance
occurs. With progressive systolic dysfunction, patients will complain of typical symptoms of congestive
heart failure including fatigue, weakness, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.[17]
Uncommonly, patients may complain of angina without coronary artery disease (CAD) at rest or with
exercise. Myocardial ischemia can result in interstitial fibrosis, which further deteriorates LV systolic
function. Syncope and sudden cardiac death are rare.
Chronic AR: clinical signs
Pulse
• Arterial pulse shows rapid rise and a quick collapse (Corrigan pulse or water hammer pulse)
resulting in widened pulse pressure >50 mmHg.
• There are multiple eponymous peripheral hemodynamic signs associated with a bounding pulse
and systolic hypertension of chronic severe AR. The sensitivity and specificity of these signs in
diagnosing AR is low and should be used only as supportive evidence.[18]
Apical impulse
• Diffuse, hyperdynamic,and shifted inferiorly and leftward.
• A systolic thrill may be palpable over the base of the heart or suprasternal notch due to increased
stroke volume.
Murmurs
• The murmur of AR is a high-pitched early diastolic, decrescendo blowing sound, which is heard
best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope just after A2.[19] The murmur is usually soft and can be
accentuated with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and holding his or her breath at the end of
expiration.
• The murmur due to valvular cause is best heard at the third and fourth intercostal space at the left
sternal border. Regurgitation due to aortic dilation resulting from dissection or aneurysm is best
heard at the second to third right intercostal space. Maneuvers that increase arterial pressure,
such as squatting, accentuate the murmur, while inhalation of amyl nitrate or Valsalva, which lower
arterial pressure, decreases the intensity of the murmur.
• Moderate to severe AR is sometimes associated with an ejection systolic flow murmur after S1 due
to the flow of increased stroke volume across a nonstenotic aortic valve. The murmur is an early

DIAGNOSIS
peaking, crescendo-decrescendo systolic sound, best heard at the second right intercostal space,
and can be differentiated from an aortic stenosis murmur by the absence of an ejection click.
• Another murmur that is often associated with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur. It is a soft,
rumbling, mid to late diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. It is produced by the abutment of an
aortic regurgitant jet against the LV endocardium.[20] An Austin Flint murmur is distinguished from
the murmur of mitral stenosis by the absence of an opening snap and loud S1.
Heart sounds
• Chronic AR is also associated with changes in heart sounds. S1 may be due to early coaptation of
the mitral valve leaflets from increased end-diastolic pressure. With increasing severity of AR, end-
diastolic pressure can rise steeply above left atrial pressure causing even diastolic closure of the
mitral valve.
• LV dysfunction can result in S3 gallop or occasionally S4 due to LV hypertrophy. Inadequate closure
of the aortic valve in severe AR may cause a soft A2 or even absent A2.
Chronic AR: imaging and investigations
Physical signs are not specific enough to judge the severity of the AR. Echocardiography should be
performed for evaluation of symptomatic and asymptomatic chronic AR. If the echocardiogram is of
insufficient quality, radionuclide angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be ordered to
evaluate the valvular abnormality.
ECG
• Normal early in the disease but shows left axis deviation in chronic AR supporting LV volume
overload. May also show signs of conduction abnormalities.[1]
Chest x-ray
• Cardiomegaly is a characteristic finding in chronic AR.
Echocardiogram
• For asymptomatic patients with chronic AR, the diagnosis can be established using a good-quality
echocardiogram, and no further diagnostic testing is required.[1] This test allows visualization of
the origin of the regurgitant jet and its width, and detection of the cause of aortic valve pathology. A
transthoracic echocardiogram is usually adequate, but a transesophageal echocardiogram can be
used if the quality of the transthoracic echocardiogram is inadequate.[1] [21]
• Two-dimensional echocardiography helps in evaluating the valvular anatomy and the impact of
volume overload on the ventricular size and function. M-mode imaging indirectly assesses the AR
by detecting premature closure of the mitral valve and diastolic fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet
from the regurgitant aortic jet.
• Doppler echocardiography is the most specific technique used for detecting the severity of
regurgitation. Several indices are used to assess severity. Color flow Doppler provides visualization
of the origin of the regurgitant jet and its width. There are several pulsed and continuous wave
Doppler methods that give clues to the severity of AR. These include color flow, pulsed wave, and
continuous wave Doppler.
Exercise testing
• In chronic severe AR, if the patient's physical activity is minimal or symptoms are equivocal,
exercise testing is helpful to assess the functional status and symptomatic response.[1]

Aortic regurgitation Diagnosis
Cardiac catheterization, angiography, or MRI
• In asymptomatic patients with chronic AR, if the quality of the echocardiogram is inadequate to
assess LV function, radionuclide angiography or MRI can be used.[1] [22]
• In cases of acute AR, right and left heart catheterization shows severe elevations of LV end-
diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) due to sudden volume
overloading of normal-sized LV. LV end-diastolic pressure is often much higher than PCWP
because of early closure of the mitral valve.
• Angiography is also used to evaluate coronary anatomy in patients with high risk for CAD and
who will be undergoing aortic valve replacement/repair. In this setting, men aged >35 years,
premenopausal women aged >35 years with risk factors for CAD, and postmenopausal women
should undergo coronary angiography.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
diastolic murmur (common)
• The absence of diastolic murmur significantly reduces the likelihood of AR.[23]
• The severity of the AR correlates well with the duration of murmur, instead of the intensity of murmur.
In mild AR the murmur is early diastolic, and increases in duration to holodiastolic in severe AR.
• A diastolic murmur may be absent in acute AR.
Other diagnostic factors
dyspnea (common)
• Caused by pulmonary edema in acute AR, or progressive left ventricular dysfunction in chronic severe
AR.
fatigue (common)
• Symptom of chronic AR due to progressive left ventricular dysfunction.
weakness (common)
• Symptom of chronic AR due to progressive left ventricular dysfunction.
orthopnea (common)

Strong
bicuspid aortic valve
• This congenital abnormality accounts for most of the cases of AR in developed countries.
• Some pathologic abnormalities of bicuspid aortic root occur, which lead to proximal aortic dilation and
worsening of AR.[8] [11]
rheumatic fever
• One of the most common causes of AR in developing countries.[1]
endocarditis
• Can lead to rupture of leaflets or even paravalvular leaks.
• Vegetations on the valvular cusps can also cause inadequate closure of leaflets, resulting in leakage of
blood.[7]

confirm the presence of AR.
• Chronic severe AR: may demonstrate nonspecific ST-T wave
changes, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with left axis deviation
due to compensatory LV chamber enlargement, or isolated premature
ventricular contraction. In later stages of LV dysfunction, LV
conduction delays may be seen.
• Acute AR: may reveal some nonspecific ST-T wave changes and
sinus tachycardia or arrhythmias; evidence of myocardial ischemia
may also be present.
• Conduction abnormalities can also be seen in active infective
endocarditis resulting from paravalvular abscess.

• Chronic AR may produce cardiomegaly in the leftward and inferior
direction due to compensatory eccentric hypertrophy from increased
end-diastolic volume. The aortic knob is typically prominent in severe
hypertensive patients and those with aortic root dilation.
• In chronic severe AR, the aortic root sometimes progressively

Test Result
Parasternal long-axis view demonstrating aortic regurgitation jet
From the collections of Dr Sanjeev Wasson
and Dr Nishant Kalra; used with permission
• Possible findings include premature closure of the mitral valve
(severe/acute AR), diastolic fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet from
the regurgitant aortic jet, and hyperdynamic interventricular septal
motion.
color flow Doppler
• One of the most specific and sensitive techniques used to judge
the severity of the regurgitant flow by using the ratio of proximal jet
width to left ventricular outflow tract and ratio of cross-sectional area

Regurgitant stroke volume can be calculated by subtracting forward
stroke volume, which can be determined at mitral valve, from total
stroke volume (aortic valve). Both regurgitant stroke volume and
regurgitant fraction can be calculated from this.
• Effective regurgitant orifice area is another measure to assess the
severity of AR, and can be calculated by dividing regurgitant stroke
volume by jet velocity time integral of the AR assessed by continuous
wave Doppler.[24]
continuous wave Doppler
• As AR gets worse, left ventricular diastolic pressure rapidly increases
and aortic diastolic pressure rapidly falls, resulting in shorter pressure
half-time or steeper slope of velocity deceleration. These measures
can be used as part of the assessment of AR severity.

Although echocardiogram accurately evaluates the severity of AR,
if the results are inconclusive or discordant with clinical findings,
cardiac catheterization should be performed to assess the severity
of AR and left ventricular (LV) function.[1] With the help of aortic root

Mitral regurgitation (MR) • Distinguishing signs are
right ventricular heave, soft
S1, split S2, and aloud P2.
The classic murmur of MR
is pansystolic at the apex
radiating to the axilla.
• CXR: pulmonary edema,
enlarged left atrium and left

calcification.
• ECG: can present with atrial
fibrillation.
• Echo: for MR it is used
to assess left ventricular
function.
Mitral stenosis • Distinguishing features
are a malar flush, low
volume pulse, a tapping and
undisplaced apex beat, and
loud S1 with an opening
snap.
• The murmur is a rumbling
mid-diastolic one, which
can be distinguished from
the Austin Flint murmur
sometimes heard in severe
AR by the absence of the
opening snap and loud S1.
• CXR: pulmonary edema,
enlarged left atrium, and
mitral valve calcification.
• ECG: can present with atrial

hypertrophy may also be
present.
• Echo: diagnostic for mitral
stenosis.
Aortic stenosis • Presentation includes
dyspnea, dizziness, fainting,
and congestive cardiac
failure.
• Characteristic signs are a
slow rising pulse, heaving
but undisplaced apex bear,
left ventricular heave, and
an ejection systolic murmur
that radiates toward the
carotids and can have an
ejection click. This can
be distinguished from the
ejection systolic murmur that
is sometimes heard with
moderate or severe AR by
absence of an ejection click
and no radiation toward the
carotids.
• CXR: left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH), calcified
aortic valve.
• ECG: P-mitrale, LVH with
strain pattern, left bundle
branch block, or complete
atrioventricular block.
• Echo: diagnostic for aortic

Aortic regurgitation Management
Approach
Acute AR is an emergency requiring urgent surgical intervention. Chronic AR has a protracted course and
the patient may remain asymptomatic for decades. Many of those who have mild or moderate AR remain
stable and may never require any corrective surgery. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible in
patients with chronic AR who develop hemodynamic instability or heart failure.
Acute AR
Acute AR is a surgical emergency. Patients require assessment and management of the airway, with
intubation if necessary. Positive inotropic agents (e.g., dobutamine) and a vasodilator (e.g., sodium
nitroprusside) are recommended for hemodynamic support. The definitive management is with urgent
surgery, especially for patients with AR resulting from infective endocarditis and aortic root dissection.[1]
[22]
Chronic AR
The treatment of chronic AR depends on 5 factors:
• Whether the regurgitation is mild, moderate, or severe
• Whether the patient is asymptomatic or symptomatic
• Whether the patient has normal left ventricular (LV) function or LV dysfunction
• Whether the patient has LV dilation
• Whether the patient is a surgical candidate.
Mild to moderate disease
Patients with mild to moderate disease (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
[ACC/AHA] stage B, progressive AR) who are asymptomatic with normal LV function do not require
treatment and can be reassured. In patients with this degree of AR severity, symptoms or LV dysfunction,
if present, are unlikely to be due to AR. An alternative underlying cause such as hypertension, coronary
artery disease, or a cardiomyopathy is more likely and should be investigated and treated. Periodic follow-
up for symptom and functional status evaluation is recommended.
In patients with moderate disease who are undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication, concomitant
aortic valve replacement can be considered.[1]
Severe disease
Patients who have asymptomatic AR with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) >55% and LV end-systolic diameter
(LVESD) <50 mm (ACC/AHA stage C1) require no treatment and the patient can be reassured. Periodic
follow-up for symptom and functional status evaluation is recommended. If the patient is undergoing
cardiac surgery for another indication, concomitant aortic valve replacement can be considered.[1]
Note that in European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, the threshold for intervention in
asymptomatic patients is LVEF <50%.[22]
Aortic valve surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients with chronic severe AR and LVEF ≤55%
(ACC/AHA stage C2), if no other cause for systolic dysfunction is identified. Aortic valve surgery is also
reasonable in patients with normal LV systolic function (LVEF >55%) when the LV is severely enlarged
(LVESD >50 mm or indexed LVESD >25 mm/m²).[1] [27] Surgery can also be considered in patients
with chronic severe AR and LVEF >55% at rest (ACC/AHA stage C1) who have a low surgical risk and a

progressive decline in LVEF to low-normal range (55% to 60%) or progressive increase in LV end-diastolic
diameter (>65 mm) on at least 3 studies.[1]
In patients who have severe AR with LV systolic dysfunction and/or symptoms but a prohibitive
surgical risk, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for reduced LVEF and/or hypertension is
recommended.[1]
All symptomatic patients require surgery, regardless of their LV function and dilation.[1] [22] [27]
Vasodilators may be used for symptomatic management while the patient is awaiting surgery.[1] If the
patient is not a surgical candidate due to comorbidities, GDMT for reduced LVEF and/or hypertension is
recommended.[1]
The surgical options are aortic valve replacement (AVR) or repair. There is no difference in the indications
for replacement or repair. AVR is performed in most patients requiring surgery. Aortic valve repair is
possible in selected patients, but is only performed in specialist centers. Following surgery, most of the
patients show reversal of LV dilation and improvement in EF. Preoperative LV function is the best predictor
of long-term prognosis in patients undergoing AVR.[28] Patients with normal preoperative EF or a brief
duration of LV dysfunction (<14 months) have greater improvement in LV diameters and early and late
postoperative improvement in LV function.[29] Patients with impaired preoperative LV function have a
greater risk of developing congestive heart failure and are at a higher risk of death compared with patients
with normal preoperative LV function.[30] Among patients with LV dysfunction, survival among patients
with preoperative severe LV dysfunction has improved dramatically since 1985 and has become almost
equivalent to that among patients with nonsevere LV dysfunction. Prosthetic valve patients are at high risk
for thromboembolism and need antithrombotic therapy. The risk of bleeding must be weighed against the
benefit of anticoagulation.
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) can be considered for carefully selected patients with
severe AR and heart failure who are not surgical candidates, but it is rarely done.[1] [22] TAVI is not
recommended for those with isolated severe AR who have indications for surgery and are candidates for
surgery.[1]

Primary prevention
Streptococcal throat infection should be treated with antibiotics to avoid the development of rheumatic fever.
High blood pressure should be controlled to prevent damage to the aortic root. Intravenous drug abuse
should be avoided. Good dental hygiene should be maintained.
See Rheumatic fever .
Secondary prevention
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with prosthetic valves during surgical or dental procedures
to prevent endocarditis.[34]
Patient discussions
Patients are encouraged to do moderate exercise, but patients with severe AR and left ventricular end-
diastolic diameter >65 mm should be advised to avoid active sports.[39] Those on anticoagulation are
advised to avoid contact sports.
Patients should be advised of the possible complications of having a prosthetic valve, such as
thromboembolism, infective endocarditis, hemolysis, structural valve failure, and arrhythmias. They
are advised to seek medical help if they become suddenly breathless, develop a fever, or experience
palpitations or sudden onset of weakness of a limb, or complete or partial loss of sight.
Patients should also be advised about the risks of being on anticoagulation, the main one being
hemorrhage. The patient should report unusual bruises, bleeding gums, coughing up blood, dark urine,

chances of bruising or bleeding, such as contact sports. They are also reminded that they should tell
the pharmacist, doctor, and dentist that they are taking warfarin, as some medications affect how the
drug works: for example, broad-spectrum antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Patients are encouraged to attend every appointment to have their international normalized ratio checked.
Cardiac rehabilitation is strongly recommended following aortic valve replacement procedures as it is
beneficial in cardiac recovery and shown to decrease the risk of hospitalization and mortality within 1 year

Aortic regurgitation Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients who present to their physician with AR on initial evaluation need to be followed up closely due
to the protracted course and potential complications of the disease. These patients need to be serially
monitored based on the severity of AR, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and left ventricular (LV)
diameters.
Serial echocardiograms are recommended every 3 to 5 years in asymptomatic patients with mild
chronic AR, and every 1 to 2 years in asymptomatic people with moderate AR.[1] In patients with severe
asymptomatic AR, echocardiogram is recommended every 6 to 12 months, with more frequent monitoring
recommended with LV dilation.[1]
Patients with aortic root dilation and diameter >4 cm should undergo serial evaluations of aortic root and
ascending aorta by echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging yearly. For more than 0.3 mm
increase in aortic diameter, confirmation with computed tomography angiogram is recommended.
Patients who undergo aortic valve replacement/repair need close follow-up during the early and
late postoperative course and need to be serially monitored. Asymptomatic patients need to be
followed up yearly for a complete history and physical exam. Any change in clinical status demands
echocardiography.
Prosthetic valve patients are at high risk for thromboembolism and need antithrombotic therapy. The risk
of bleeding must be weighed against the benefit of anticoagulation.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
operative mortality short term medium
There is a 4% risk of death with aortic valve replacement/repair (AVR), and the risk increases to 6.8% if
performed along with coronary artery bypass graft.[33] [38]
heart failure long term high
The most common complication of severe AR. Mild to moderate AR may remain asymptomatic throughout
the patient's life or may progress to severe AR and then heart failure.
Chronic severe AR patients should be referred for aortic valve replacement/repair (AVR) as soon as they
develop any symptoms, impaired exercise tolerance, or decreased ejection fraction.[32] [33]
Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure should be started on
medical therapy (inotropes and vasodilators) and referred for AVR.
arrhythmias long term low
Stretching and dilation of the left atrium results in atrial fibrillation, which leads to weakness, dyspnea,
palpitations, and occasionally syncope.
The atrioventricular node, due to its proximity to the aortic valve, may be damaged secondary to stretching
and scarring, which sometimes results in bradyarrhythmias and different degrees of block that are treated
with medications and/or a pacemaker.
infective endocarditis variable low
Bacteremia with organisms likely to cause endocarditis results in this complication in patients with
underlying structural valvular defects.
Patients with AR are considered to be at low risk of developing endocarditis, and prophylactic antibiotics
are not required before bacteremia-causing procedures.[34]
sudden death variable low
Sudden death is rare in patients with severe AR and normal ventricular function. Annual mortality is 0.4%.
One paper reported unexpected sudden deaths in patients with maintained systolic function but severe
ventricular dilation.[35]
myocardial ischemia variable low
Patients with AR may complain of angina without coronary artery disease due to increased myocardial
oxygen requirement and decreased coronary flow reserve.[36] [37]

Aortic regurgitation Follow up
Prognosis
The outcome and prognosis of patients depends on the magnitude of left ventricular (LV) function and
symptoms.[29] [30] The 5-year survival in patients with normal LV function has been reported as 96%
whereas that in patients with reduced LV function is 62%.[30] Long-term improvement in LV function
is related to the immediate and short-term (first 6 months) response to surgery. Patients who have
an immediate reduction in LV dilatation following surgery are more likely to have short- and long-term
improvements in the ejection fraction (EF). Furthermore, patients who have an improvement in EF within
the first 6 months following surgery are likely to have further late improvements in LV function after this time.
The EF is unlikely to improve in patients who do not have an improvement in EF within the first 6 months of
surgery.[29]

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
