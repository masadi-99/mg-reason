Gestational hypertension Overview
Summary
Gestational hypertension is defined as a blood pressure (BP) of ≥140/90 mmHg on two occasions (at least
4 hours apart) after 20 weeks' gestation in a previously normotensive woman, without the presence of
proteinuria or other clinical features (thrombocytopenia, impaired renal or kidney function, pulmonary edema,
or new-onset headache) suggestive of preeclampsia.
Women with gestational hypertension are usually asymptomatic.
Women require regular monitoring of BP and urinalysis during the pregnancy to exclude preeclampsia.
Hypertension (systolic BP of 140 mmHg or more or diastolic BP of 90 mmHg or more, or both) is managed
with lifestyle modification and/or antihypertensive therapy.
Severe hypertension (BP ≥160/110 mmHg) requires admission to the hospital for antihypertensive therapy.
For women ≥37 weeks' gestation, induction should be considered.
Definition
Gestational hypertension is defined by BP readings of ≥140/90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours
apart after 20 weeks' gestation in a previously normotensive woman, without the presence of proteinuria
(<300 mg in 24 hours) or other clinical features (thrombocytopenia, impaired renal or kidney function,
pulmonary edema, or new-onset headache) suggestive of preeclampsia.[1][2]

Gestational hypertension Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Hypertension is the most frequently identified medical problem during pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders are
a common cause of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy, contributing to poor maternal and neonatal
outcomes if not adequately managed. Between 2017 and 2019, the prevalence of pregnancy-associated
hypertension in the US increased from 10.8% to 13.0%.[3]
The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is higher in healthy nulliparous women compared with
multiparous women.[4] [5] The highest prevalence of hypertensive disorders is in women ages >45 years.[3]
Black women are at greater risk than white women.[3]
Etiology
The exact etiology of gestational hypertension remains unknown. It is thought that insulin resistance may
mediate the clinical onset of hypertension in pregnancy.[6]
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of gestational hypertension is not completely understood. Blood pressure is usually
elevated in pregnancy because of upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but this is
balanced by a drop in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output. In women with gestational
hypertension, the SVR remains low but cardiac output tends to increase.[7]
It is unclear whether gestational hypertension and preeclampsia represent distinct pathologies or are varying
aspects along a single pathophysiologic spectrum.[8]
Classification
American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) practice
bulletin 222[1]
• Gestational hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 mmHg or more or a
diastolic BP of 90 mmHg or more, or both, on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks'
gestation in a woman with previously normal BP.
• Hypertension in pregnancy is considered severe if the systolic BP level reaches 160 mmHg or the
diastolic BP level reaches 110 mmHg, or both. If faced with severe hypertension, the diagnosis
may need to be confirmed within a shorter interval (minutes) than 4 hours, to facilitate timely
antihypertensive therapy. These women should be diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features.
• Gestational hypertension is diagnosed if hypertension without proteinuria or severe features develops
after 20 weeks' gestation and BP levels return to normal in the postpartum period.
• Gestational hypertension has similarities with preeclampsia; the management of gestational
hypertension and that of preeclampsia without severe features is similar in many aspects, and both
require enhanced surveillance.
• All hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, are associated with
adverse pregnancy outcomes and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.

Case history
Case history #1
A 30-year-old woman (gravida 2 para 1) at 22 weeks' gestation presents to the outpatient obstetrics
clinic for a routine prenatal visit. She has no significant past medical history. Her first pregnancy was
uncomplicated and her child (now 4 years of age) is doing well. On examination, she is afebrile with a
respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, pulse of 91 bpm, and blood pressure (BP) of 132/102 mmHg.
Her previous BP reading was 120/80 mmHg. Urinalysis is negative for glucose and protein. The woman
is asked to return in 1 week for a BP check. On check-in at the clinic, the woman tells the nurse that she
does not have any symptoms. However, on examination, her BP has risen to 142/106 mmHg. Urinalysis
remains negative for glucose and protein.

Gestational hypertension Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Diagnosis of gestational hypertension is based on at least two elevated blood pressure (BP) readings
(≥140/90 mmHg), in the absence of proteinuria, occurring after 20 weeks' gestation. All manifestations
of gestational hypertension are presumptive until retrospectively confirmed by complete resolution of
hypertension and any other new abnormalities in the postpartum period.
Clinical evaluation
Prepregnancy BP readings help establish whether the BP elevation is a new problem. If the woman's
previous BP status is unknown, the initial reading is regarded as the baseline; therefore, distinguishing
gestational hypertension from chronic hypertension may only be possible after the pregnancy.
Women with gestational hypertension are usually asymptomatic. The woman should be asked about
symptoms that suggest preeclampsia, such as weight gain, edema, headaches, and upper abdominal
pain.
A detailed personal and family history should be elicited, with evidence of cardiovascular disease or its
risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia) documented.
Investigations
Twenty-four hour BP monitoring can be considered when BP readings are equivocal.[2] However, more
evidence is needed on whether ambulatory BP monitoring is beneficial in women with gestational
hypertension.[26] One small randomized controlled trial found no difference in outcomes between the
use of a manual BP device (sphygmomanometer) and an automated BP device in pregnant women with
hypertension (essential, gestational, or preeclampsia).[27]
Urinalysis should be performed at prenatal visits and results interpreted in the context of a clinical
review for preeclampsia. A quantitative urinary protein collection is required if urinalysis is positive or if
a suspicion of preeclampsia is present from the clinical evaluation. Twenty-four hour urine collection is
awkward for women and, where available, alternative spot tests such as protein:creatinine ratio (PCR, for
which a result of ≥0.3 is diagnostic) is preferred.[1][5]
Pregnant women with a new diagnosis of hypertension should have baseline blood tests (complete
blood count, liver function tests, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, uric acid) to screen for
preeclampsia, with care taken to use pregnancy-specific thresholds.
On diagnosis of gestational hypertension, ultrasound examination of estimated fetal weight and amniotic
fluid index and umbilical artery doppler velocimetry are recommended.
If preeclampsia is suspected
A range of additional maternal and fetal investigations may be recommended, including fetal
cardiotocography, complete blood count, renal function, and liver function tests. Where available, the use
of placental growth factor (PIGF)-based testing may reduce the time to diagnosis of preeclampsia, with
consequent reduction in incidence of severe maternal adverse outcomes in women presenting between
20-36 weeks plus 6 days of gestation.[5] [28] [29] See Preeclampsia (Diagnostic approach) .

Gestational hypertension Diagnosis
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
previously normotensive (common)
• If the woman's previous blood pressure (BP) status is unknown, it may not be possible to distinguish
gestational hypertension from chronic hypertension at presentation.
BP ≥140/90 mmHg (common)
• A diagnosis of gestational hypertension should be made only after two readings ≥140/90 mmHg,
spaced at least 4 hours (but no more than 7 days) apart.
• Measurement of diastolic BP during pregnancy should include K5 or the disappearance of the
Korotkoff sound as opposed to K4 or the muffling of this sound.
Other diagnostic factors
>20 weeks' gestation (common)
• If hypertension is noted before 20 weeks' gestation, it is likely to be chronic hypertension.
absence of symptoms that suggest preeclampsia (uncommon)
• Significant weight gain, peripheral edema, headaches, and upper abdominal pain are suggestive of
preeclampsia.
Risk factors
Strong
nulliparous
• The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is higher in healthy nulliparous women
compared with multiparous women.[4] [5]
maternal age >35 years
• The risk of gestational hypertension increases with increasing age, and women ages 35 years and
older are more likely to undergo induction of labor or cesarean delivery.[9]
Weak
black or Hispanic ethnicity
• Black women are at greater risk than white women.[3]
obesity
• An increase in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference from 18 years of age to the first
pregnancy may have a role in the future development of hypertension during pregnancy.[10] [11][12]

Differentiating tests
Preeclampsia • Usually there are no
differentiating signs or
symptoms, which is why it is
important to always perform
urinalysis.
• Occasionally other
symptoms may be present,
including greater than
expected weight gain,
peripheral edema, blurred
vision, and headaches.
• Proteinuria is ≥300 mg
in 24 hours, or dipstick is
persistently 2+.
Eclampsia • Eclampsia is preeclampsia
superimposed with seizures
during the ante-, intra-, or
postpartum period.
• Proteinuria is ≥300 mg
in 24 hours, or dipstick is
persistently 2+.
Hypertension, essential • There are no differentiating
signs and symptoms.
• The woman already has
an established history
of hypertension before
pregnancy, or hypertension
persists after 12 weeks
postpartum.
• Clinical diagnosis.
Criteria
Criteria for gestational hypertension[1]
• Systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg obtained on a minimum of
two occasions.
• Measurements must be taken at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation.
• Women are typically normotensive before both pregnancy and 20 weeks' gestation.
Severity classification of gestational hypertension[1]
• Hypertension: systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg, or both.
• Severe hypertension: sustained BP elevations for a minimum of 4 hours with systolic BP ≥160 mmHg
and/or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg. In severe hypertension, the diagnosis may need to be confirmed
within a shorter interval (minutes) between BP measurements.

Screening
Pregnant women without a personal or family history of cardiac
disease
Screening is important because most women are asymptomatic. Women should be screened at each
prenatal visit with blood pressure (BP) measurement and urinalysis.[1][2][5] [30] [31]
If the BP reading is >140/90 mmHg, a follow-up measurement must be obtained.
A urine dipstick test is useful for identifying the presence of albumin and protein. If the dipstick test is
positive, proteinuria should be quantified using spot testing where available.[1] [2][5] [30]
Pregnant women with a personal or family history of cardiac
disease
Pregnant women with a strong personal or family history of cardiac disease may require additional tests.
They should be offered the same investigations as women who are not pregnant.[32]

Gestational hypertension Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Early detection and optimal outpatient management is associated with low rates of hospital admission and
low perinatal and maternal mortality.
Plan for delivery
Less than 37 weeks' gestation
Planned early delivery (before 37 weeks' gestation) should not be offered to women with gestational
hypertension whose blood pressure (BP) is lower than 160/110 mmHg, unless there are other
indications.[1] [5]
Indications for planned early delivery include the following:
• Preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes
• Vaginal bleeding
• Abnormal fetal testing
• Intrauterine growth restriction
• Development of preeclampsia (depending on the gestational age and severity) or eclampsia
• Evidence of end-organ damage (e.g., neurologic, hepatic, or renal dysfunction).
Routine induction of labor in women with hypertensive disorders at 34-37 weeks' gestation significantly
increases the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.[36]  However, there is evidence to suggest
that planned early delivery after 34 weeks' gestation is associated with a reduction in maternal morbidity
and mortality.[37]
If planned early delivery before 34 weeks' gestation is necessary, offer prenatal magnesium sulfate for
neuroprotection of the baby, as indicated.[38] [39]
If planned early delivery before 37 weeks' gestation is necessary, offer prenatal corticosteroids to mature
fetal lungs, as indicated.[38] [40]
37 weeks' gestation and over
Women diagnosed with gestational hypertension at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation are generally best
managed by delivering the baby by induction within 24-48 hours, after maternal stabilization, rather than
expectant management.[41]  However, timing of birth and maternal and fetal indications for birth for
women whose BP is <160/110 mmHg after 37 weeks' gestation should be agreed between the mother
and the senior obstetrician.[5]
If the woman does not respond to medical induction, cesarean delivery is necessary.
Management of hypertension
Systolic BP levels ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP levels ≥90 mmHg to systolic BP levels ≤159 mmHg
and/or diastolic BP levels ≤109 mmHg (hypertension)
Hypertension can generally be managed on an outpatient basis.[5] [42][Evidence C] Treatment should
begin with lifestyle modifications such as changes in diet (through consultation with a dietitian), but salt
restriction should not be recommended only to prevent gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.[5]
Note that significant weight loss is not recommended for obese mothers, because this may affect the

Gestational hypertension Management
growth of the fetus; however, limited or no weight gain in obese pregnant women has favorable pregnancy
outcomes.[43]
If lifestyle interventions fail to control the BP and it remains above 140/90 mmHg, antihypertensive
medication is recommended, with a target BP of 135/85 mmHg or less.[1] [5] Evidence supports
initiating or titrating medical therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension whose BP is ≥140/90
mmHg; this is associated with better fetal and maternal outcomes, compared with initiating or titrating
medical therapy for severe hypertension only.[44] [45] [46]  Frequent fetal and maternal evaluation is
recommended. 
Labetalol is usually considered the antihypertensive of choice and is effective as monotherapy in 80%
of women.[1] [5][47] It seems safe and effective for the management of hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy; however, it should be avoided in women with asthma or any other contraindications to its
use.[1] [Evidence C]
Oral nifedipine may be as effective as intravenous labetalol, and can be considered in cases of
deteriorating hypertension previously controlled with oral labetalol.[48]
Oral monotherapy with labetalol or nifedipine is effective in most cases, although some women may
require combination therapy.[1]
Methyldopa is widely used in lower- and middle-income countries and remains an acceptable alternative
if labetalol or nifedipine is not suitable.[2][5] Methyldopa should be avoided in the postpartum period due
to its association with depression; women already taking methyldopa should change to an alternative
antihypertensive treatment within 2 days of delivery.[5] [49]
The choice of antihypertensive agent for women with gestational hypertension should be based on
adverse effect profiles, risk (including fetal effects), and the woman's preferences.[5]
Systolic BP levels ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP levels ≥110 mmHg (severe hypertension)
All women with persistent severe hypertension (systolic BP >160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP >110 mmHg
for >15 minutes) should be admitted to the hospital and started on antihypertensive medication, with
a target BP of 135/85 mmHg or less.[1] [5] For the management of acute-onset, severe hypertension
in a critical care setting, labetalol (oral or intravenous), oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydralazine is
recommended as a first-line option.[1] Parenteral therapy may be needed initially for acute control of BP,
but oral medications can then be used. Second-line options (e.g., combination therapy, alternative drugs)
can be discussed with a specialist if the woman does not respond to first-line therapies.[1] [5] Hydralazine
is widely used to manage severe hypertension in pregnancy; however, it can produce an acute fall in BP
and should be used along with plasma expansion.[5] Smaller, more frequent doses of hydralazine may be
used.
The woman's BP should be measured every 15-30 minutes until it is less than 160/110 mmHg; once BP
falls below 160/110 mmHg, manage as for hypertension.[1] [5]
Postpartum management
After delivery of the baby, continue monitoring the mother's BP and adjust her antihypertensive
medication if required. For women with gestational hypertension who required antihypertensive therapy
before delivery, reduce their antihypertensive treatment if their BP falls below 130/80 mmHg. For
women with gestational hypertension who did not require antihypertensive therapy before delivery,

should not be recommended only to prevent
gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.[5]
» If lifestyle interventions fail to control the
blood pressure (BP) and it remains above
140/90 mmHg, antihypertensive medication is
recommended, with a target BP of 135/85 mmHg
or less.[1] [5] [44] [45] [46] 
» Labetalol is usually considered the
antihypertensive of choice and is effective as
monotherapy in 80% of women.[1] [5][47] It
seems safe and effective for the management of
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; however, it
should be avoided in women with asthma or any
other contraindications to its use.[1]
» Oral nifedipine may be as effective as
intravenous labetalol, and can be considered in
cases of deteriorating hypertension previously
controlled with oral labetalol.[48]
» Oral monotherapy with labetalol or nifedipine is
effective in most cases, although some women
may require combination therapy.[1]
» Methyldopa is widely used in lower- and
middle-income countries and remains an
acceptable alternative if labetalol or nifedipine
is not suitable.[2][5] Methyldopa should be
avoided in the postpartum period due to its
association with depression; women already
taking methyldopa should change to an
alternative antihypertensive treatment within 2
days of delivery.[5] [49]
» The choice of antihypertensive agent for
women with gestational hypertension should be
based on adverse effect profiles, risk (including
fetal effects), and the woman's preferences.[5]

MANAGEMENT
Acute
with severe hypertension
(systolic BP ≥160 mmHg
and/or diastolic BP ≥110
mmHg)
plus antihypertensive therapy
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» labetalol: 10-20 mg intravenously initially,
followed by 20-80 mg every 10-30 minutes
according to response, maximum 300 mg/
total dose; or 1-2 mg/minute intravenous
infusion
OR
» nifedipine: 10-20 mg orally (immediate-
release) initially, repeat in 20 minutes if
needed, followed by 10-20 mg every 2-6
hours according to response, maximum 180
mg/day
OR
» hydralazine: 5 mg intravenously initially,
followed by 5-10 mg every 20-40 minutes
according to response, maximum 20 mg/
total dose; or 0.5 to 10 mg/hour intravenous
infusion
» For the management of acute-onset, severe
hypertension in a critical care setting, labetalol
(oral or intravenous), oral nifedipine, or
intravenous hydralazine is recommended as
a first-line option. Parenteral therapy may be
needed initially for acute control of BP, but oral
medications can then be used. Second-line
options (e.g., combination therapy, alternative
drugs) can be discussed with a specialist
if the woman does not respond to first-line
therapies.[1] [5] Hydralazine is widely used to
manage severe hypertension in pregnancy;
however, it can produce an acute fall in BP and
should be used along with plasma expansion.[5]
Smaller, more frequent doses of hydralazine may
be used.

MANAGEMENT
Emerging
Magnesium sulfate
This drug, often used in preeclampsia and eclampsia to control seizures, is being considered by some
clinicians for use in gestational hypertension. However, prolonged use of magnesium sulfate is not
recommended. The UK-based Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends
against any use of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy for longer than 5-7 days. If prolonged or repeated use
occurs during pregnancy (for example, multiple courses or use for more than 24 hours), consider monitoring
of neonates for abnormal calcium and magnesium levels and skeletal adverse effects. In 2013, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a similar recommendation relating to use of magnesium sulfate as a
tocolytic.[50] [51] See Pre-eclampsia (Management approach) .
Primary prevention
Weight management, stress management, and adherence to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in
animal fat, particularly saturated fat, are generally recommended for essential hypertension. It is unknown
whether they are beneficial in gestational hypertension.
In women in developing countries with low baseline dietary calcium intake, dietary calcium supplementation
has been shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and premature birth, and increase birth weight.
[18]  Dietary calcium supplementation for the prevention of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is only
recommended in a research setting.[19]
Antiplatelet agents during pregnancy reduce the incidence and severity of preeclampsia.[1][4] [5] [20] [21]
[22] Women at high risk of preeclampsia (includes a hypertensive disorder during a previous pregnancy,
multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, renal disease, autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus
erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome, and type 1 or 2 diabetes) should take 75-150 mg of aspirin
daily, starting between 12 weeks' and 28 weeks' gestation, and optimally before 16 weeks' gestation, until the
birth of the baby.[1] [5] [23] [24] [25]
Secondary prevention
Bed rest is not recommended as a treatment for gestational hypertension.[5] [72]
In subsequent pregnancies women are recommended to take 75-150 mg of aspirin daily, starting between 12
and 28 weeks' gestation, and optimally before 16 weeks' gestation, until the birth of the baby.[1] [5] [23] [24]
[25]
Patient discussions
Women with gestational hypertension should promptly report any symptoms, including decreased fetal
movement.[1][5] Self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP) may be feasible as an adjunct to office-based
surveillance for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia, although two linked trials found that while self-
monitoring seemed safe, it made no difference to the timing of diagnosis or control of high BP.[66] [67]
[68] One small mixed-methods study supported the acceptability and accuracy of self-testing of urine for
proteinuria during pregnancy.[68] [69] [70]
Women should be instructed to recognize symptoms of severe preeclampsia, such as blurred vision,
headache, peripheral edema, or upper abdominal pain.[1] [5]
After delivery, all women who had gestational hypertension should undergo a medical review 6-8 weeks
after the birth.[5]
Women with gestational hypertension who are overweight or obese should engage in healthy lifestyle
changes in order to prevent progression to chronic hypertension.[71]

Gestational hypertension Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Blood pressure (BP) is measured and urinalysis is routinely performed during each prenatal visit.[31] The
frequency of visits increases as the pregnancy progresses or if BP is increasing.
At each visit, maternal and fetal evaluation are undertaken, including complete blood count, liver and
renal function tests, and quantitative urinary protein testing (spot testing where available, or 24-hour urine
collection), as needed.[1][5][65]
Placental growth factor (PlGF)-based testing should be performed on one occasion.[5] [28]
In women under 37 weeks' gestation with hypertension, outpatient management with close supervision is
acceptable. Women with severe hypertension (systolic BP ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg),
or who are symptomatic, require admission for antihypertensive therapy.[5]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
preeclampsia short term medium
The risk is high if hypertension develops early in pregnancy.
Increased BPs adversely affect renal function, leading to proteinuria. A urine albumin level of >300 mg in
24 hours with hypertension is diagnostic.
Placental growth factor (PlGF)-based testing, used with standard clinical assessment, can help rule in or
rule out preeclampsia for women with suspected preeclampsia between 20 and 36 weeks plus 6 days of
gestation.[28]
pregnancy-associated stroke short term low
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase the risk of pregnancy-associated stroke.[63] [64] Compared
with the first trimester, the rate of stroke is five times higher in the early postpartum period. It can be
prevented by management of BP.
cardiovascular disease in the mother long term high
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with short-term vascular complications, as well as
earlier and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[56] [57] [58][59] Other risk factors include early
adverse changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and relative hyperandrogenism.[60]
fetal or neonatal complications long term low
Presence of gestational hypertension increases the risk of macrosomia, intrauterine growth restriction
(poor fetal growth), stillbirth, cesarean delivery, and admission of the neonate to the intensive care unit.
The coexistence of gestational diabetes further increases the risk.[61]
Mean gestational age and mean birth weight tend to be lower.[62]

Gestational hypertension Follow up
Prognosis
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are estimated to complicate up to 10% of pregnancies worldwide, with
gestational hypertension occurring in 6% of pregnancies.[52] [53] Black and Hispanic women may have
greater progression of gestational hypertension to preeclampsia/eclampsia compared with white women.[3]
 The most important factors influencing maternal and neonatal outcomes are the severity of hypertension and
presence of end-organ damage, rather than excess protein excretion.[54]
Long-term disease associations
Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease later
in life. Regular assessment of cardiovascular risk in these women provides a unique opportunity for timely
cardiovascular prevention.[55] [56]

Recommendations as stated in the source guideline
• Do not routinely admit to hospital women with nonsevere gestational hypertension (blood pressure
140/90 to 159/109 mmHg).
• Do not offer bed rest in hospital as a treatment for gestational h y p e r t e n s i o n ᵇ . 
 Note
The guideline committee noted that they did not have enough evidence to recommend that either home or
hospital blood pressure monitoring should take precedence.
ᵃ  In both groups, blood pressure monitoring was for 7 days only, after which all women saw an obstetrician.
Both groups were also told to contact an obstetrician if their daily urine dipstick showed ≥1+ protein, or if they
had abnormal symptoms. Blood pressure results were stored on a central database for the “not updated”
group, whereas in the other group an obstetrician was immediately informed if the mean blood pressure was
>160/100 mmHg over three successive readings.
ᵇ  The guideline committee noted that while hospital bed rest was favored for preterm birth and severe
hypertension, but not for induction of labor, the study underpinning the evaluation of this intervention
was carried out in Zimbabwe, and employed different standards of maternity care to the UK, making the
results difficult to extrapolate. Based on their clinical experience, the guideline committee therefore did not
think it was necessary to admit women with gestational hypertension for hospital bed rest, and kept the
recommendation from the previous version of the guideline.

risk (including fetal effects), and the woman's preferences.
Note
• The guideline categorised studies on ‘acute’ management as those including care of women with
sudden, uncontrolled hypertension, very high blood pressure levels, or with acute symptoms of
preeclampsia (headache, visual disturbance, upper abdominal pain).
• The guideline committee noted that there was not enough evidence to recommend one treatment over
another.
ᵃ  No route of administration is reported in the guideline or original study for either drug.

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
