Chronic venous insufficiency Overview
Summary
Chronic venous insufficiency signs and symptoms include increasing leg pain, fatigue, and heaviness with
prolonged standing, associated with dilated tortuous veins.
More severe cases exhibit progressive skin changes, venous stasis dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and
frank ulceration.
Underlying venous insufficiency is most efficiently documented, localized, and graded by duplex ultrasound.
Conservative treatment requires graded compression.
Open surgical or endovenous treatment options may be used in highly selected cases.
Venous ulceration and bleeding are recognized complications.
Definition
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) refers to functional changes that may occur in the lower extremity due to
persistent elevation of venous pressures. This most commonly results from venous reflux due to faulty valve
function developing as a long-term sequela of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and recanalization, and may also
develop due to primary valvular incompetence without previous episode(s) of DVT. The term CVI is usually
reserved for more advanced disease involving edema, skin changes, or frank ulcers.

Chronic venous insufficiency Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Prevalence estimates for CVI vary widely, depending on geographic region and diagnostic criteria.[3] [4] [5]
[6][7] [8] In one systematic review, the estimated pooled prevalence was 8% for class C3 (edema), 4% for
class C4 (skin changes secondary to CVI), 1% for class C5 (healed venous ulcer), and 0.42% for class C6
(active venous ulcer).[4]
Common risk factors for chronic venous disease, and CVI, are increasing age, female sex, obesity, family
history, and occupations with prolonged standing.
Etiology
CVI is caused by functional abnormalities in lower extremity veins. The abnormality is usually reflux, but it
can also be chronic obstruction or a combination of the two. It occurs in as many as 50% of people within
5-10 years of an episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).[9] Congenital absence of the venous valves is
a less common cause, and isolated primary varicose veins (pure superficial incompetence) uncommonly
causes severe CVI.
Pathophysiology
Normal venous return from the extremities to the heart requires the presence of normal calf and foot muscle
pumps, patent veins, and competent valves. Theoretically, problems with any of these systems can result in
venous insufficiency.
Severe CVI usually results from chronic valvular reflux, less commonly from venous obstruction, and
frequently from a combination of both. These pathophysiologic changes produce ambulatory venous
hypertension. While walking, people with normal venous function have a relatively low extremity venous
pressure (<20 mmHg). This can more than double in people with deep system incompetence.
The typical constellation of findings that ensue include edema, lipodermatosclerosis, and eventual ulceration.
Lipodermatosclerosis characteristically results from capillary proliferation, fat necrosis, and fibrosis of the skin
and subcutaneous tissues. Hyperpigmentation (usually a reddish-brown discoloration) of the ankle and lower
leg is also known as brawny edema. It results from extravasation of blood and deposition of hemosiderin in
the tissues due to long-standing ambulatory venous hypertension.
The fibrin cuff hypothesis of Burnand suggests that the problem is venous hypertension with resultant
extravasation of plasma proteins and fibrinogen into the soft tissue, resulting in a fibrin cuff around the
capillaries and tissue hypoxia. The white cell trapping theory of Coleridge-Smith suggests that white cells are
trapped in capillaries due to venous hypertension with secondary escape of proteins into the interstitial space
and resultant diminished tissue oxygenation.[10]

Chronic venous insufficiency Theory
2020 update of the Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and
Pathophysiological (CEAP) classification system[1]
The CEAP classification is an internationally recognized standard for describing patients with chronic
venous disorders, originally developed in 1993 and updated in 1996, 2004, and 2020. It is based on clinical
manifestations, etiology, involved anatomy, and the underlying venous pathology.[1]
This staging system is extensive, but the clinical class is the only aspect in common use.
Clinical class
• C0: no visible or palpable signs of venous disease
• C1: telangiectasias or reticular veins
• C2: varicose veins
• C2r: recurrent varicose veins
• C3: edema
• C4: changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue secondary to chronic venous disease (now divided into
three subclasses to better define the differing severity of venous disease)
• C4a: pigmentation or eczema
• C4b: lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche
• C4c: corona phlebectatica
• C5: healed venous ulcer
• C6: active venous ulcer
• C6r: recurrent active venous ulcer.
Each clinical class may be subcharacterized as:
• S: symptomatic (including ache, pain, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, muscle cramps, and other
complaints attributable to venous dysfunction)
• A: asymptomatic.
Etiologic class
• Ec: congenital
• Ep: primary
• Es: secondary
• Esi: secondary - intravenous
• Ese: secondary - extravenous
• En: no venous cause identified.
Anatomic class
• As: superficial veins
• Ap: perforator veins
• Ad: deep veins
• An: no venous location identified.
Pathophysiologic class (accompanied by the anatomic location)
• Pr: reflux
• Po: obstruction
• Pr,o: reflux and obstruction
• Pn: no venous pathophysiology identifiable.

Chronic venous insufficiency Theory
THEORY
CVI corresponds with C3 to C6 of the CEAP classification.[2]
Case history
Case history #1
A 55-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of a large wound on his right lower leg. He has had
chronically swollen legs for >10 years. He notes that his brother (deceased, myocardial infarction) and
mother (deceased, pulmonary embolism) had similar problems in their legs. He had two documented
episodes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the affected leg 5 years earlier.
Case history #2
A 70-year-old woman presents with gradual, progressive leg swelling. She also has itching, occasional
skin flaking, and darkness of the leg. The swelling gets worse as the day progresses. Various topical
agents have provided little relief.
Other presentations
Patients with CVI may also present with superficial thrombophlebitis, which presents as localized pain,
tenderness, and erythema in the involved area. Skin changes may be advanced in CVI patients with more
severe disease (e.g., pigmentation, eczema, frank ulceration). The skin and subcutaneous tissues may
also be fibrotic with brawny induration, a condition known as lipodermatosclerosis.

Chronic venous insufficiency Diagnosis
Approach
The diagnosis of CVI is based on a careful clinical history, a thorough physical exam, and targeted
investigations.
Clinical history
Patients may present with symptoms of heavy legs, leg fatigue, aching, and/or discomfort that develop
and worsen toward the end of the day and on prolonged standing, and improve on elevation. Burning
and itching of the skin and leg cramps may be present and are often associated with venous stasis
and eczema. Initially, periodic elevation may reduce the swelling, but more severe cases almost always
require additional control through compression.[2][11] [14] [15] [16]
Physical exam
The lower extremities should be examined with the patient standing:[2]
• Early signs of CVI include telangiectasias (dilated intradermal venules, <1 mm in diameter),
reticular veins (dilated, nonpalpable, subdermal veins, ≤3 mm in diameter), and corona
phlebectatica (also known as malleolar flare or ankle flare). It consists of a fan-shaped pattern of
small intradermal veins on the ankle or foot and is thought to be a common early physical sign of
advanced venous disease.
• Palpation for bulges consistent with varicose veins (dilated, palpable, subcutaneous veins) is
undertaken. The extent, size, and location of the tortuous dilated veins are noted. Primary varicose
veins are not commonly associated with significant edema or skin changes, but occasionally pure
superficial venous system incompetence can be associated with edema, skin changes, and even
frank ulceration.
• Ankle swelling (usually unilateral, but may be bilateral) due to edema is also common. It
characteristically indents with pressure and initially occurs in the ankle region but may extend to the
leg and foot.

• Severe CVI is associated with characteristic skin changes such as atrophie blanche,
lipodermatosclerosis, and hyperpigmentation. Atrophie blanche is characterized by localized,
frequently round areas of white, shiny, atrophic skin surrounded by small dilated capillaries and,
sometimes, areas of hyperpigmentation. Lipodermatosclerosis is a localized chronic inflammatory
and fibrotic condition affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the lower leg, especially in
the supramalleolar region. When severe, it may even lead to contracture of the Achilles tendon.
Hyperpigmentation (usually a reddish-brown discoloration) of the ankle and lower leg is also known
as brawny edema. It results from extravasation of blood and deposition of hemosiderin in the
tissues due to long-standing ambulatory venous hypertension.

An important subset of patients with CVI has iliac vein obstruction, more commonly on the left than the
right. Such patients usually present predominantly with swelling and lack other features of CVI.
Investigations
A variety of techniques may be employed to investigate patients with CVI:[2][10] [16][17]
• Duplex ultrasound imaging combines brightness-mode imaging and Doppler interrogation. It is
the initial and most important primary diagnostic study. It can localize sites of obstruction and
valvular reflux in both the deep and superficial venous systems. It should be noted that duplex

ultrasound is operator dependent and that it should be performed as a reflux study and not only as
an examination for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Venous reflux is characterized by retrograde
or reversed flow and a valve closure time of more than 0.5 seconds.
• Ascending phlebography identifies the site and level of obstruction, as well as the presence and
location of collaterals, but it has been supplanted by duplex imaging, except when used by a
specialist to evaluate treatment options for complex CVI.
• Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance venography provide excellent anatomic
detail, so are useful in evaluating congenital and complex or advanced cases of CVI.
• Patients with unilateral leg edema suggesting iliac vein obstruction should be evaluated
with an ultrasound or a CT scan to rule out a pelvic or abdominal mass. If no evidence of
extrinsic compression is found, the patient should be referred to a vascular specialist for further
investigations, including an ascending phlebography. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is also used
in specialized centers as a secondary test to evaluate the significance of iliac vein obstruction in
complex cases of CVI. It is extremely useful in the diagnosis and therapy of iliac vein disease.
• Air plethysmography is a noninvasive investigation that assesses venous function (identifying reflux
and obstruction). It is primarily used for research and is not frequently used in the US outside of
highly specialized centers or research settings.

Risk factors
Strong
increasing age
• Prevalence of venous disease increases with age.[11]
family history
• Strong risk factor for acute and chronic venous disease.[11]
smoking
• Cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for severe CVI in men.[11]
deep vein thrombosis
• As many as 50% of people develop CVI within 5-10 years of an episode of deep vein thrombosis
(DVT) due to increased dilation of the venous system leading to axial system reflux.
orthostatic occupation
• Occupations (e.g., laborer) that require prolonged standing are thought to predispose to venous
insufficiency.[11]
Weak
female#sex
• Leg injury, prolonged standing, increasing parity, and cardiovascular disease are all strongly
associated with venous insufficiency in women.[11]
obesity (waist circumference)
• Increased body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference increase the risk for chronic venous
disease.[11]
ligamentous laxity
• Risk of CVI is increased in those with ligamentous laxity, suggested by, among other clinical features,
the presence of flat feet and history of hernia surgery.[11]

Chronic venous insufficiency Management
Approach
Graded compression stockings are the cornerstone of CVI treatment, supplemented by further specialized
procedures, the choice of which depends on the specific associated clinical features.
Compression
The mainstay of treatment for CVI-related edema, stasis dermatitis, and small venous leg ulcers is the
use of graded compression knee-high stockings.[2] [20] [21]
Serial images of recurrent venous ulcer with resolution at 3 months
From the collection of Dr Joseph L. Mills; used with permission
• As therapy may be lifelong, patient adherence is of critical importance. An estimated 30% to
65% of patients are nonadherent with compression therapy. Recurrence of venous leg ulcers in
patients adherent with stocking use is half that in those who are nonadherent. Nonadherence with
prescribed stockings is the primary cause of compression therapy failure.[22]
• In Cochrane reviews, compression stockings were more effective in healing venous ulcers than
no compression therapy.[23] [24]  For ulcer healing, multilayer dressings are more effective than
single-layer dressings.[25] A single randomized controlled study suggested that “progressive”
stockings, which progressively apply maximal compression (23 mmHg at the level of the calf vs. 10
mmHg at the ankle), were superior to a “degressive” stocking (30 mmHg at ankle vs. 21 mmHg at
upper calf). The outcome measure used was a composite consisting of improvement in pain, deep
and/or superficial venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus (PE), and ulceration of skin.[15]
• Stockings must be put on first thing in the morning and should be removed only when the patient is
recumbent (usually just before going to bed).
• In the US, there are three classes of compression stockings. Class 1 stockings (20-30 mmHg)
control edema. Class 2 (30-40 mmHg) and class 3 (>40 mmHg) are usually required for more
advanced CVI.
• Thromboembolic disorder (TED) stockings are inadequate for controlling CVI and should not be
prescribed for this condition because the pressure at the ankle is insufficient at <20 mmHg.
• Patients with severe CVI or previous ulcers generally require lifelong graded compression stockings
of ≥30 to 40 mmHg.
Intermittent pneumatic compression may also be considered in patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, to
reduce severity.[2]

MANAGEMENT
• It is generally felt that applying a simple moisturizing cream to combat skin dryness and flaking is
beneficial.
Venous leg ulcers
• Long-term therapy with nonspecific local unguents or topical antibiotic ointments or creams is of
no benefit and may damage adjacent skin. The use of such therapies is also strongly discouraged
because of allergic reactions and the potential for breakdown of the dermal barrier.
• Pentoxifylline and micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) have shown some benefit in
venous leg ulcer healing in randomized clinical trials.[26]
• Pentoxifylline is used to treat claudication. A meta-analysis of five trials showed a minimal benefit
to venous leg ulcer healing with oral pentoxifylline (odds ratio 1.3) compared with compression
therapy and placebo.[27]
• A meta-analysis of prospective randomized trials of MPFF in the treatment of venous leg ulcer
compared compression and local care with and without the addition of oral MPFF.[28] At 6 months,
the chance of ulcer healing was 32% better in patients treated with adjunctive MPFF than in those
managed by conventional therapy alone (relative risk reduction 32%, 95% CI 3% to 70%). This
difference was present from month 2 (relative risk reduction 44%, 95% CI 7% to 94%) and was
associated with a shorter time to healing (16 weeks vs. 21 weeks; P=0.0034). These data suggest
that MPFF may be a useful adjunct to conventional therapy in large and longstanding venous leg
ulcers. Diosmin (an MPFF) is available in some European, Asian, and South American countries
and in Canada, but not in the US or the UK.
• One systematic review determined that, while data were limited by heterogeneity and small sample
sizes, pentoxifylline has demonstrated clinical benefits when used In conjunction with compression
therapy.[29]
• The following systemically given drugs are ineffective in healing venous leg ulcers: aspirin,
ifetroban, stanozolol, antibiotics, and hydroxyrutosides.
• Topically applied growth factors have not been systematically shown to be efficacious in speeding
up venous leg ulcer healing.
Leg pain
• Where available, venoactive drugs, such as diosmin, can also be considered for the treatment of
CVI pain.[2]
Invasive procedures
Superficial venous reflux
• Saphenectomy: a randomized controlled trial of saphenectomy (surgical stripping) and compression
versus compression alone in patients with significant reflux in the great or small saphenous vein on
duplex ultrasound showed 89% to 93% initial ulcer healing rates in both groups (P value reported
as not significant). Ulcer recurrence rates at 4 years were 52% in the compression-only group
compared with only 24% in those who underwent saphenectomy and compression, a difference
that was statistically significant.[30] These findings strongly suggest that saphenectomy confers
long-term benefit in patients with CVI who also have superficial venous reflux.
• Endovenous laser therapy or radiofrequency ablation of the great saphenous vein (GSV): these
procedures can be done with outpatients under local tumescent anesthesia and have generally
replaced surgical stripping for most patients requiring GSV ablation. Following endovenous
ablation, compression stockings should be worn for 24 hours per day for 1-3 days, then during
the day for 1-2 weeks. Postoperatively, normal activities can be resumed, but strenuous leg

activity (e.g., running, weighted leg exercises, cycling) should be avoided for 1 week. Continued
use of compression stockings during the day is recommended following ablative procedures on
the superficial system if there is ongoing evidence of reflux (i.e., deep system insufficiency). A
randomized controlled trial comparing endovenous laser ablation therapy with saphenopopliteal
junction ligation plus attempted stripping/excision for the treatment of small saphenous vein
insufficiency has reported similar 2-year outcomes, but with the possible benefit of fewer short-
term sensory deficits with endovenous laser ablation therapy.[31] Early endovenous ablation of the
superficial venous reflux (within 2 weeks) has been found to result in faster healing of venous leg
ulcers and more time free from ulcers than deferred endovenous ablation (considered after ulcer
was healed or at 6 months if ulcer was not healed).[32]
• Foam sclerotherapy: this technique can also be used to ablate the GSV.[33] The sclerosant agent is
mixed with air to produce foam, which is then injected into the vein under ultrasound guidance. The
foam displaces blood in the vein and causes spasm of the vein and endothelial injury, resulting in
thrombosis of the vessel. Retinal or cerebral emboli (causing migraine, but rarely stroke) may occur
with the use of foam in 2% to 6% of patients, but these adverse sequelae are almost always minor
and transient.[34]
• A meta-analysis of over 12,000 legs investigated the success rate of these therapies as determined
by duplex ultrasound documenting successful vein excision or ablation and lack of residual
reflux.[34] Measured in this manner, after a mean follow-up of 32 months, the relative effectiveness
rates were 77% for foam sclerotherapy, 78% for surgical stripping, 84% for radiofrequency ablation,
and 94% for laser ablation. The major complication of these techniques was DVT, occurring in 1%
to 3% of patients. Individualized thromboprophylaxis strategies should be considered.[2]
Angiomata and varicosities
• These lesions may occasionally cause symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant laser or
radiofrequency ablation or injection sclerotherapy, which may be liquid or, increasingly, foam
sclerotherapy. It should be noted that foam sclerotherapy is not approved in the US for this use.
Perforating vein incompetence
• Incompetent perforating veins may be treated with endovenous ablation (laser or radiofrequency) or
ligation.[2]
Iliac vein obstruction
• An important subset of patients with CVI has iliac vein obstruction, more commonly on the left
side than the right. In selected patients (determined by a vascular specialist), symptoms may be
substantially improved by percutaneous iliac angioplasty and stenting. These procedures are
performed in significant numbers only in selected centers, and the indications for such procedures
are still developing.[35]
Deep venous reflux
• Venous valvular reconstruction (either with leaflet repair or with axillary valve transplantation) is
rarely performed and its use is generally confined to selected centers. Results are far better when
performed in patients with primary rather than post-thrombotic venous reflux.[36] The operation is
generally reserved for patients in whom conventional therapy has failed.

Chronic venous insufficiency Management
Emerging
Balneotherapy
Balneotherapy is a traditional medical technique using water. One Cochrane review has assessed the use
of balneotherapy in the management of patients with CVI and found that compared with no treatment, there
is probably no improvement in disease severity signs and symptoms, but there are improvements in health‐
related quality of life and pain and reductions in skin pigmentation changes.[37]
Biologics (amnion/chorion allografts)
Amniotic membrane contains wound-healing proteins and growth factors and it has been studied in treatment
of chronic venous leg ulcers. In one randomized controlled trial, 101 patients with chronic venous leg ulcers
were randomized to receive either dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft with standard of care
or standard of care alone. Addition of dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft to standard of care
resulted in more healed ulcers at 12 weeks (75% compared with 30%).[38]
Spray-applied cell therapy
Results from one phase 2 double-blind randomized controlled trial of 205 people with venous leg ulcers
suggest that dosing of growth-arrested allogeneic neonatal keratinocytes and fibroblasts in a fibrin vehicle
is associated with a higher proportion of healing when compared with vehicle alone.[39] These promising
results warrant further studies in this area.
Other pharmacologic therapies
A number of initial trials support some benefit to patients with CVI from a number of agents, including
venoactive drugs (VADs), calcium dobesilate, and red-vine-leaf extract.[40] [41] [42] Pain, edema, and leg
volume appear to be reduced, but further trials with better stratification of disease type and severity are
needed before the use of these agents can be recommended.
Exercise
A systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials comprising 190 patients with venous
leg ulcers has shown that exercise may be an effective adjuvant to compression for the treatment of venous
leg ulcers.[43] The exercise interventions were progressive resistance exercise alone or combined with
prescribed physical activity, walking only, or ankle exercises. Progressive resistance exercise combined with
prescribed physical activity appeared to be most effective, although the effect was reported to be imprecise
(additional 27 patients healed in 100 patients; 95% CI 9 to 45 cases in 100; P=0.004).[43] On the whole,
exercise was associated with increased venous ulcer healing at 12 weeks, although the effect was reported
to be imprecise (additional 14 patients healed per 100; 95% CI 1 to 27 cases in 100; P=0.04). European
Society of Vascular Surgery guidelines note that there is a lack of studies on exercise in CVI, but suggest
that the indirect evidence for the benefit on venous function is considerable and that it should therefore be
promoted.[2] One Cochrane review found that there is currently insufficient evidence to assess the benefits
and harms of physical exercise programs for the treatment of individuals with nonulcerated CVI.[44]
Primary prevention
No specific measures have been shown to prevent CVI. However, avoiding prolonged sitting or standing,
controlling weight, abstaining from tobacco, exercising, and intermittently elevating the leg may all be helpful.
Theoretically, aggressive prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), particularly for patients admitted
to the hospital, may reduce the incidence of CVI, as it occurs in as many as 50% of people within 5-10
years of an episode of DVT.[12] Long-term treatment with low molecular weight heparin, rather than oral
anticoagulation after DVT, may reduce or prevent development of post-thrombotic CVI.[13] Patients at high
risk for CVI, such as those with a family history of varicose veins, those with a previous history of DVT, and
those with an orthostatic occupation, should consider wearing graduated compression stockings.

MANAGEMENT
Secondary prevention
Prolonged standing, especially in one place, should be avoided. If this is not possible, compression stockings
should be worn. If obese, patients should be advised to lose weight.
Patients with severe CVI or previous ulcers generally require lifelong graded compression stockings of at
least 30-40 mmHg. Adherence with compression therapy markedly reduces, but does not eliminate, long-
term sequelae.
Patient discussions
The patient should be reassured that the condition is not limb threatening and differs from the circulatory
problems that are due to diabetes and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
All patients with documented CVI should be advised to wear graded compression stockings. These
stockings must be put on first thing in the morning and should be removed only when the patient is
recumbent (usually just before going to bed). The importance of adherence with compression therapy
must also be emphasized, as an estimated 30% to 65% of patients are nonadherent with compression
therapy. The recurrence of venous leg ulcers in patients adherent with stocking use is half that in those
who are nonadherent, and nonadherence is the primary cause of compression therapy failure.[22]
Patients should be advised that thromboembolic disorder (TED) stockings are inadequate for controlling
CVI, as they provide insufficient compression at the ankle.
Patients with severe CVI or previous ulcers should be advised that they may require lifelong graded
compression stockings. Following endovenous ablation, patients are usually advised to wear compression
stockings for 24 hours per day for 1-3 days, and then during the day for 1-2 weeks. Postoperatively,
patients can return to normal activities, but they should avoid strenuous leg activity such as running,
weighted leg exercises, or cycling for 1 week. Continued use of compression stockings during the day
is recommended following ablative procedures on the superficial system if there is ongoing evidence of
reflux (i.e., deep system insufficiency).

Monitoring
Monitoring
Venous stripping or ablation is helpful in patients with CVI who have documented superficial venous
reflux.[30] European Society of Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend considering duplex ultrasound
surveillance 1-4 weeks after treatment of a saphenous trunk to document successful treatment and lack
of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).[2] Repeat evaluation is recommended if initial results are inadequate,
symptoms persist, or varicosities recur.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
saphenectomy and endovenous-related DVT short term low
Saphenectomy and endovenous ablation (laser and radiofrequency) are associated with a 1% to 3% rate
of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurrence.[34] Individualized thromboprophylaxis strategies should be
considered.[2]
hemosiderin deposition long term high
Secondary to changes in the microcirculatory system, with the capillaries becoming elongated, fibrotic, and
leaky.
Hyperpigmentation (usually a reddish-brown discoloration) of the ankle and lower leg is also known as
brawny edema. It results from extravasation of blood and deposition of hemosiderin in the tissues due to
long-standing ambulatory venous hypertension.
venous ulceration long term medium
Increased dilation of the venous system and increased pressure may lead to venous hypertension. The
typical constellation of findings that ensue include edema, lipodermatosclerosis, and eventual ulceration.
Perforator incompetence may also contribute to ulceration.
Treatment of the superficial axial system, if involved, will help.[30] Perforator treatment is considered if
perforating veins are involved.
lipodermatosclerosis long term medium
Secondary to changes in the microcirculatory system, with the capillaries becoming elongated, fibrotic,
and leaky. Characteristically results from capillary proliferation, fat necrosis, and fibrosis of the skin and
subcutaneous tissues.
hemorrhage long term low
Erosion of varices can lead to bleeding that may require surgical intervention.
infection long term low
Uncommon in patients adherent with compression therapy, and good skin care and hygiene. Only consider
treatment of a leg ulcer with antibiotics if there are clinical signs of infection. Do not routinely swab leg
ulcers because colonization without infection is common. Follow local guidelines for antibiotic treatment,
and make a specialist referral in patients with multiple comorbidities, and where there is suspicion of
antimicrobial resistance, osteomyelitis, sepsis, or necrotizing fasciitis.[46]

Prognosis
Physicians should note, and the patient should be reassured, that CVI is not limb threatening and differs
from the circulatory disorders of diabetes and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Patients with severe CVI
(CEAP C4-6) or previous ulcers generally require lifelong graded compression stockings of at least 30-40
mmHg. Adherence with compression therapy markedly reduces, but does not eliminate, long-term sequelae.
The recurrence of venous leg ulcers in patients adherent with stocking use is half that in those who are

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
