Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Overview
Summary
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe drug reaction to heparin that can lead to life- and limb-
threatening venous and/or arterial thromboembolism.
Diagnosis requires the combination of a compatible clinical picture and laboratory confirmation of the
presence of heparin-dependent platelet-activating HIT antibodies.
The 4Ts score is commonly used to determine the clinical probability of HIT.
Neither discontinuation of heparin alone nor initiation of a vitamin K antagonist alone (e.g., warfarin) is
sufficient to stop the development of thrombosis in a patient with acute HIT.
If a patient has suspected HIT and at least an intermediate-probability 4Ts score, all sources of heparin
(including low molecular weight heparin) must be discontinued and a nonheparin anticoagulant should be
initiated.
Definition
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a clinicopathologic syndrome that occurs when heparin-
dependent, IgG antibodies bind to heparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes to activate platelets and produce
a hypercoagulable state. This results in thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis in temporal relationship to
a preceding immunizing exposure to heparin.[1] HIT typically develops 5 to 10 days after exposure to
heparin (range of 4-15 days) and can occur with unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin,
or, more rarely, fondaparinux. The presence of heparin-dependent antibodies alone, without any clinical
manifestations, is insufficient for a diagnosis of HIT.
Fondaparinux, a pentasaccharide anticoagulant, does not usually promote antibody binding to PF4, despite
its structural similarity to heparin, owing to absent/weak cross-reactivity. Therefore, it has a very low risk of
inducing HIT. Despite rare reports of fondaparinux-induced HIT, observational studies report the successful
use of fondaparinux to treat HIT, and it is considered to be a nonheparin anticoagulant.[2] [3]

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The prevalence of HIT may range from 0.1% to 5.0% in patients exposed to heparin, and varies significantly
according to a number of host- and drug-related risk factors.[8] [9] Postoperative and trauma patients
who receive heparin have the highest incidence of HIT (1% to 5%), whereas HIT is very uncommon in
medical patients who receive prophylactic doses of heparin (<1%), and is extremely rare in obstetric patients
(<0.1%).[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The risk of HIT is significantly higher with unfractionated heparin compared
with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).[9] [15] [16]  Women appear to have a 1.5- to 2-fold increased
risk of HIT compared with men.[17]
Etiology
The etiology of HIT is unknown. The rapid production of IgG antibodies (median of 4 days) without initial
IgM antibody production suggests a secondary immune response, despite the absence of previous
exposure to heparin in the majority of patients who develop HIT.[18] [19] These observations have led to the
hypothesis that sensitization of the antiheparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody occurs as the result of other
environmental exposures (e.g., bacterial infection) that produce the same antigen as the one produced by the
heparin/PF4 complex.[20] [21]
Pathophysiology
Platelet factor 4 (PF4) molecules bind to heparin on the surface of platelets to form a neo-antigen that is
recognized by HIT (IgG) antibodies.[22] [23] Antiheparin/PF4 antibodies bind to the large heparin/PF4
complexes and activate the same or adjacent platelets through their Fc receptors.[24] [25] Activation of
platelets leads to production of procoagulant platelet-derived microparticles and thrombin generation with the
potential for development of the clinical manifestations that are characteristic of HIT (i.e., thrombocytopenia
and venous and/or arterial thrombosis).[26] [27] Activation of monocytes and the endothelium have also
been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIT.[28] [29] [30] Typically, HIT antibodies are transient, becoming
undetectable within 100 days (depending on the assay performed).[5] [31]
Classification
Clinical classification of HIT
Isolated HIT:
• Patients who have thrombocytopenia secondary to HIT antibodies without evidence of thrombosis or
other sequelae of HIT.[4]
Delayed-onset HIT:
• HIT that begins several days after heparin has been discontinued.[5]
Rapid-onset HIT:
• Refers to a platelet count drop occurring within 24 hours of exposure to heparin due to persistence
of HIT antibodies from a recent exposure to heparin (i.e., typically <30 days but can be up to 100
days).[5] An appropriate clinical picture and laboratory confirmation of HIT is essential since a rapid
drop in platelet count is atypical for most patients with HIT and likely has other causes.

Case history
Case history #1
A 55-year-old woman presents with a left-leg deep vein thrombosis 2 days after being discharged from the
hospital. She had been admitted with acute coronary syndrome and was treated with intravenous heparin
for 6 days. Her platelet count has declined from 250 × 10⁹/L at the start of her treatment with heparin to 80
× 10⁹/L. Her physical exam is unremarkable except for left-leg edema and tenderness.
Case history #2
A 65-year-old woman is admitted to a rehabilitation floor 10 days after undergoing elective right
total hip arthroplasty. She received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for thromboprophylaxis
beginning on postoperative day 1, but intravenous heparin was subsequently started on postoperative
day 9 for confirmed pulmonary embolism. Her platelet count was 175 × 10⁹/L on admission to the
rehabilitation floor compared with 350 × 10⁹/L when intravenous heparin was initiated. Her physical exam
is unremarkable except for normal postoperative changes. A venous Doppler ultrasound of her leg is
negative for deep vein thrombosis.
Other presentations
HIT less commonly presents as adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis (secondary to adrenal vein thrombosis),
necrotizing skin lesions at heparin injection sites, cerebral venous thrombosis, or as an acute systemic
reaction 30 minutes following an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous LMWH
(e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, hypertension, dyspnea, cardiopulmonary arrest).[6] Rarely, patients
with HIT-provoked deep vein thrombosis will present with venous limb gangrene (as a consequence of
inappropriate treatment with a vitamin K antagonist).[7]

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Diagnosis
Approach
HIT should be suspected when a patient presents with new thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis in the
context of confirmed or suspected exposure to heparin (i.e., unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight
heparin [LMWH], or, more rarely, fondaparinux) within the past 100 days, particularly following recent cardiac
or orthopedic surgery. HIT should also be considered when a patient presents with adrenal hemorrhagic
necrosis (secondary to adrenal vein thrombosis), necrotizing skin lesions at heparin injection sites, or an
acute systemic reaction in the context of exposure to heparin or LMWH within the past 100 days.
Diagnosis requires the combination of both a compatible clinical picture and laboratory confirmation of the
presence of heparin-dependent platelet-activating HIT antibodies. The presence of HIT antibodies alone,
without any clinical manifestations, is not sufficient for a diagnosis of HIT.
Clinical picture
The first step is to determine the likelihood that a patient has HIT based on clinical criteria. This includes
a careful review of the patient's history of heparin exposure (i.e., unfractionated heparin, LMWH, or
fondaparinux). The risk of HIT, according to heparin type, in order from highest to lowest is as follows:
unfractionated heparin >LMWH >fondaparinux.[16] [32] Fondaparinux, a pentasaccharide anticoagulant,
does not usually promote antibody binding to platelet factor 4 (PF4), despite its structural similarity to
heparin, owing to absent/weak cross-reactivity. Therefore, fondaparinux has a very low risk of inducing
HIT. Observational studies report the successful use of fondaparinux to treat HIT, and it is considered to
be a nonheparin anticoagulant.[2] [3]
An absence of conditions or medications that cause thrombocytopenia increases the likelihood of HIT.
A history of recent surgery (especially orthopedic or cardiovascular) or trauma increases the likelihood
of HIT in patients exposed to heparin. Patients with a history of HIT who are re-exposed to heparin for at
least 4 days are at risk of recurrence.
Features consistent with a recent venous or arterial thromboembolic event are common (e.g., deep
vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE], stroke, myocardial infarction [MI]). These include:
new unilateral leg edema, tenderness, or discoloration (DVT); chest pain, tachypnea, hypotension, or
tachycardia (PE or MI); focal neurologic deficits (stroke).
Fever, chills, tachycardia, hypertension, dyspnea, or cardiopulmonary arrest may occur within 30 minutes
of a dose of heparin and is usually accompanied by an abrupt drop in platelet count.
Necrosis may be seen on examination at the heparin injection sites. Bleeding in patients with HIT is
rare and there may be no or minimal signs of bleeding (e.g., petechiae, ecchymosis). Patients with
adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis may present with abdominal pain, refractory hypotension, and Addisonian
crisis. Patients with cerebral venous thrombosis may present with headache, nausea, vomiting, and/or
neurologic deficits. Rarely, patients with HIT-provoked DVT will present with venous limb gangrene (as a
consequence of inappropriate treatment with a vitamin K antagonist).[7]

Clinical prediction tools
A number of clinical prediction tools have been developed to help physicians determine clinical probability
of HIT (e.g., 4Ts score, HIT expert probability [HEP] score).
While the clinical prediction rules differ on specific details, they all focus on several key features:
• Magnitude of the platelet count fall
• Timing of the platelet count fall (or other HIT-related event) in relation to start of heparin
• Presence or absence of alternative explanations for thrombocytopenia.
The 4Ts score has been subject to greater evaluation than other tools, and is recommended by the
American Society of Hematology:[36] [37] [38] [39] [40]

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Diagnosis
• Points from 0-2 are given for 4 categories: magnitude of Thrombocytopenia, Timing of onset of
platelet fall (or other sequelae of HIT), Thrombosis, and oTher explanation for the platelet fall.
• Pretest probability of HIT:
• A low score (0-3) indicates <1% probability of HIT
• An intermediate score (4-5) indicates approximately 10% probability of HIT
• A high score (6-8) indicates approximately 50% probability of HIT.
HIT can be excluded by a low 4T’s score without the need for further laboratory investigation, unless there
is uncertainty over the accuracy of the patient’s results.[41] A typical high 4Ts score would be a patient
who experiences a 50% drop in platelet count with a nadir ≥20 × 10⁹/L between days 5 and 10 of heparin
exposure, and is found to have new thrombosis and no alternative explanation for the drop in platelet
count.
HEP score:[42]
• Points from -3 to +3 are given for 8 categories: magnitude of fall in platelet count, timing of fall in
platelet count, nadir platelet count, thrombosis, skin necrosis, acute systemic reaction, bleeding,
other causes of thrombocytopenia.
Laboratory confirmation of HIT
A complete blood count (CBC) should be ordered in all patients with suspected HIT and typically shows
a falling platelet count. The timing of the fall in platelet count (beginning from the first day of heparin
exposure [day 0]) is key. An example would be a patient who experiences a 50% drop in platelet count
with a nadir ≥20 × 10⁹/L between days 5 and 10 of heparin exposure. The platelet count does not have
to fall below 150 × 10⁹/L for HIT to be considered (e.g., ≥50% decrease from baseline during the correct
time frame is still suspicious for HIT, even if the absolute platelet nadir is >150 × 10⁹/L).
It is not uncommon for the platelet count to initially fall after surgery and then rise to a level higher than
the preoperative count (rebound thrombocytosis). In such cases, the postoperative rebound platelet count
should be considered the new baseline count in these patients when determining the clinical probability of
HIT. Thrombocytopenia in the context of pancytopenia reduces the likelihood of HIT.
Coagulation studies (i.e., international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time) should be
ordered in patients with suspected HIT to exclude coagulopathy. However, HIT may induce disseminated
intravascular coagulation in 10% to 20% of patients; therefore, coagulopathy and low fibrinogen levels do
not exclude HIT if the clinical scenario is otherwise consistent.[43]
Patients with at least an intermediate clinical suspicion for HIT (i.e., 4Ts score of ≥4) should undergo
testing for HIT antibodies.[38] A low 4Ts score (i.e., ≤3) alone has high negative predictive value;
guidelines recommend against laboratory testing in these patients.[38] [41][44] [45] If, however, there is
uncertainty about the score (e.g., multiple missing platelet counts, history of recent heparin exposure is
unclear, concurrent potential causes of thrombocytopenia), testing for HIT should be considered.[38] [46]
A wide variety of laboratory assays are used to confirm the presence of HIT antibodies. These assays
generally fall into one of two categories:
• Antigen assays (e.g., anti-platelet factor 4 [PF4]/H enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA],
H/PF4-PaGIA) are available at most clinical centers. Antigen assays are highly sensitive (>99%),
but they have a high false-positive rate. False positives result from detection of all types of
HIT antibodies, regardless of their ability to activate platelets.[47] For example, up to 50% of

DIAGNOSIS
cardiovascular surgery patients will develop HIT antibodies, but only 2% of those patients will
develop HIT.[11] ELISAs that detect IgG antibodies only are more specific for HIT and the higher
the titer of the antigen assay, the higher the likelihood the patient has platelet-activating antibodies
(i.e., the greater the likelihood the patient has HIT or improved specificity).[36] Some rapid
immunoassays that can provide results in less than 30 minutes appear to have similar diagnostic
properties to the ELISAs.[46] [48]
• Functional assays (e.g., serotonin release assay, heparin-induced platelet activation) are limited to
a small number of clinical centers, but have better specificity than the antigen assays. Functional
assays detect antibodies based on their platelet‐activating properties (i.e., antibodies that are more
likely to be clinically significant).[49] These assays have high sensitivity (>95%) and specificity
(>95%) for HIT; therefore, in the context of a compatible clinical picture, a positive result confirms
HIT and a negative result excludes HIT.[10] [50]
As many centers do not have access to functional assays, diagnosis is often based on clinical suspicion
for HIT (based on the 4Ts score) combined with antigen assay results, as shown in the table below.[51]

DIAGNOSIS
Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan) should
be performed in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and a cerebral computed tomography
venogram (CTV) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the head in patients with suspected
cerebral venous thrombosis.[52]
Thrombosis has been reported in up to 50% of patients with untreated HIT.[53] In the context of confirmed
HIT, the presence of a DVT may lengthen the duration of treatment.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
history of recent heparin exposure (common)
• Received unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux for the past
5-10 days (range 4-15 days) or within the past 100 days.
• The risk of HIT, according to heparin type, in order from highest to lowest is as follows: unfractionated
heparin >LMWH >fondaparinux.[16] [32]
history of HIT (common)
• Patients with a remote history of HIT who are re-exposed to unfractionated heparin or low molecular
weight heparin for at least 4 days are at risk of recurrence.
absence of conditions and medications that cause thrombocytopenia
(common)
• Increases the likelihood of HIT (e.g., sepsis; absence of drugs such as vancomycin, carbamazepine,
sulfa drugs, antineoplastic agents, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, quinine/quinidine).[54]
history of recent surgery or trauma (common)
• Postoperative and trauma patients who receive heparin have the highest incidence of HIT (1% to 5%),
whereas HIT is very uncommon in medical patients who receive prophylactic doses of heparin (<1%),
and is extremely rare in obstetric patients (<0.1%).[10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
• Surgery/trauma releases platelet factor 4 (PF4), which increases the likelihood of HIT in patients
exposed to heparin. The higher levels of PF4 produced by surgical and nonsurgical trauma favor
the stoichometric concentrations of PF4 and heparin required to form the antigen recognized by HIT
antibodies.[35]
• The timing of the platelet fall in relationship to surgery/trauma is important because these events are
also alternative causes of thrombocytopenia/thrombosis.

Risk factors
Strong
recent heparin exposure (within past 100 days)
• The risk of HIT, according to heparin type, in order from highest to lowest is as follows: unfractionated
heparin >low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) >fondaparinux.[16] [32] There is a consensus that
differences in the polysaccharide chain length and degree of sulfation of the drugs explains this
ranking.[33] [34] Fondaparinux, at one third the length of heparin, still stimulates the formation of
antiheparin/platelet factor 4 (PF4) HIT antibodies, but only rarely triggers the platelet activation
required to elicit the clinical manifestations of HIT.[2]

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Diagnosis
• HIT typically develops 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin (range of 4-15 days). It is important to
be aware that, even if HIT antibody formation occurs during the typical day 5 to 10 window period,
thrombocytopenia can occur later (even after heparin exposure has been discontinued).
recent orthopedic or cardiovascular surgery
• Postoperative and trauma patients who receive heparin have the highest incidence of HIT (1% to 5%),
whereas HIT is very uncommon in medical patients who receive prophylactic doses of heparin (<1%),
and is extremely rare in obstetric patients (<0.1%).[10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
• A key link between patient population and risk for HIT is the circulating level of platelet factor 4
(PF4). The higher levels of PF4 produced by surgical and nonsurgical trauma favor the stoichometric
concentrations of PF4 and heparin required to form the antigen recognized by HIT antibodies.[35]
Weak
female sex
• Women appear to have a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of HIT compared with men.[17] For reasons that
are unclear, the difference according to sex is less apparent when low molecular weight heparin is the
cause of HIT.

patients will develop HIT antibodies, but only 2% of those patients
will develop HIT.[11] ELISAs that detect IgG antibodies only are
more specific for HIT and the higher the titer of the antigen assay,
the higher the likelihood the patient has platelet-activating antibodies
(i.e., the greater the likelihood the patient has HIT or improved
specificity).[36] Some rapid immunoassays that can provide results in
less than 30 minutes appear to have similar diagnostic properties to
the ELISAs.[46] [48]
• Patients with at least an intermediate clinical suspicion for HIT
(i.e., 4Ts score ≥4) should undergo laboratory testing for HIT
antibodies.[38] A low 4Ts score (i.e., ≤3) alone has high negative
predictive value; guidelines recommend against laboratory testing
in these patients.[38] [44] [45] If, however, there is uncertainty
about the score (e.g., multiple missing platelet counts, history of
recent heparin exposure is unclear, concurrent potential causes of
thrombocytopenia), testing for HIT should be considered.[38] [46]

antibodies (with high titer

HIT functional assay
• Functional assays (e.g., serotonin release assay, heparin-induced
platelet activation) are limited to a small number of clinical centers,
but have better specificity than the antigen assays. Functional assays
detect antibodies based on their platelet‐activating properties (i.e.,
antibodies that are more likely to be clinically significant).[49] These
assays have high sensitivity (>95%) and specificity (>95%) for HIT;
therefore, in the context of a compatible clinical picture, a positive
result confirms HIT and a negative result excludes HIT.[10] [50]
• As many centers do not have access to functional assays, diagnosis
is often based on clinical suspicion for HIT (based on the 4Ts score)
combined with antigen assay results.[51]

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Diagnosis
Criteria
4Ts score
The 4Ts clinical prediction tool can be used to estimate the probability of a patient having HIT. Points are
scored (0, 1, or 2) for each of the 4 categories (maximum possible score = 8).[36] [37]
Thrombocytopenia
• 2 points if >50% fall in platelet count to a platelet count nadir of ≥20 × 10⁹/L
• 1 point if 30% to 50% fall in platelet count, or if the nadir is 10-19 × 10⁹/L
• 0 points if <30% fall in the platelet count, or if the nadir is <10 × 10⁹/L.
Timing* of onset of platelet fall (or other sequelae of HIT)
• 2 points if onset is 5-10 days after starting heparin, or <1 day if there has been recent heparin (within
past 30 days)
• 1 point if onset is >10 days after starting heparin or if timing unclear; or if <1 day after starting heparin
with recent heparin (past 31-100 days)
• 0 points if onset is within 4 days of first-time heparin exposure (no recent heparin).
Thrombosis or other sequelae
• 2 points if there is a proven new thrombosis, or heparin skin necrosis, or acute systemic reaction after
intravenous unfractionated heparin bolus
• 1 point if there is progressive or recurrent thrombosis, or erythematous skin lesions, or suspected
thrombosis (not proven)
• 0 points if no thrombosis or other finding.
oTther cause(s) of platelet fall
• 2 points if none evident
• 1 point if there is another possible cause
• 0 points if there is another definite cause.
Pretest probability score
• High = 6-8 points (approximately 50% probability of HIT)
• Intermediate = 4-5 points (approximately 10% probability of HIT)
• Low = 0-3 points (<1% probability of HIT).
*First day of immunizing heparin exposure is considered day 0. It is also worth noting that, if the patient
undergoes surgery, the day that heparin is restarted after the procedure is considered day 0 of heparin
exposure, even if the patient received heparin preoperatively. Surgery is a strong immunizing risk factor for
HIT and can, therefore, potentially reset the clock for the development of HIT. Similarly, if heparin is given
intraoperatively, the surgery date becomes day 0.
A typical high score would be a patient who experiences a 50% drop in platelet count with a nadir ≥20 ×
10⁹/L between days 5 and 10 of heparin exposure, and is found to have new thrombosis and no alternative
explanation for the drop in platelet count.
The 4Ts score has been subject to greater evaluation than other tools, and is recommended by the American
Society of Hematology.[36] [37] [38] [39] [40]

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Points from -3 to +3 are given for 8 categories: magnitude of fall in platelet count, timing of fall in platelet
count, nadir platelet count, thrombosis, skin necrosis, acute systemic reaction, bleeding, other causes of
thrombocytopenia.
Screening
Among patients receiving heparin in whom the risk of HIT is considered low (<0.1%), the American Society
of Hematology (ASH) guideline panel suggests against platelet count monitoring to screen for HIT.[38] The
potential benefit of screening is likely to be highest in settings where patients have a 1% or greater risk of
HIT (e.g., patients receiving heparin or low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] following surgery or trauma)
and a functional test for platelet‐activating antibodies is available to reduce the likelihood of false-positive
results.[44]
Screening for HIT usually means obtaining serial platelet counts in patients who are receiving unfractionated
heparin/LMWH, or, more rarely, fondaparinux for at least 4 days, or in patients who have presented with
thrombosis in the context of exposure to these drugs within the past 100 days. Due to the large number of
alternative causes of thrombocytopenia, routine platelet count monitoring has the potential to cause harm
due to unnecessary withdrawal of heparin and institution of nonheparin anticoagulants in patients who do not
have HIT.
HIT antibody assays are not appropriate for screening.
Platelet count monitoring
If screening is performed, platelet counts are typically checked every 2 or 3 days from day 4 to 14 (or until
heparin is stopped, whichever comes first).[38] If a platelet count drop is noted during routine screening and
the pretest probability of HIT is at least moderate (i.e., 4Ts score ≥4), confirmatory laboratory testing for HIT
antibodies is recommended.
It is also worth noting that, if the patient undergoes surgery, the day that heparin is restarted after the
procedure is considered day 0 of heparin exposure, even if the patient received heparin preoperatively.
Surgery is a strong immunizing risk factor for HIT and can, therefore, potentially reset the clock for the
development of HIT. Similarly, if heparin is given intraoperatively, the surgery date becomes day 0.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Management
Approach
Treatment of suspected HIT is premised upon 4Ts score:
• ≥4 indicating a high or intermediate clinical probability of HIT, or
• ≤3 indicating a low probability of HIT.
Diagnostic algorithm for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
Created by the BMJ Knowledge Centre
Suspected HIT with 4Ts score ≥4, or confirmed acute HIT
If a patient has suspected HIT and an intermediate- or high-probability 4Ts score (i.e., ≥4), all sources of
heparin (including low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) must be discontinued immediately (including
heparin used for flushing lines) and a blood sample sent for laboratory confirmation of HIT.[38]
Some clinicians are unaware that LMWH is contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed HIT;
therefore, it is important to reiterate that LMWH should not be continued or started in these patients.
If a vitamin K antagonist (e.g., warfarin) has been started, oral or intravenous vitamin K should be
administered and the vitamin K antagonist discontinued. Vitamin K antagonists alone will not prevent the
development of HIT-associated thrombosis. Furthermore, they increase the risk of venous gangrene if
used without overlap with other nonheparin anticoagulants in patients with confirmed HIT who have not
achieved platelet recovery.[58]
A nonheparin anticoagulant should be initiated before the result of the HIT assay is available (even if the
patient does not currently have thrombosis).[38] Therapeutic doses of a nonheparin anticoagulant should
be given to patients with a high-probability 4Ts score (≥6), and patients with an intermediate-probability
4Ts score (4 or 5) who are not at high risk of bleeding.[38] Therapeutic doses should be continued if HIT

is confirmed. Patients with an intermediate-probability 4Ts score who are at high risk of bleeding can
be given prophylactic doses of a nonheparin anticoagulant while awaiting results of the HIT assay.[38]
However, once HIT is confirmed, the dose should be increased to therapeutic levels if possible.[38]
Choice of nonheparin anticoagulant
The choice of nonheparin anticoagulant depends on clinical factors such as whether cardiac surgery or
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is necessary, the presence of renal impairment, and pregnancy.
It may also depend on other factors such as cost, availability, and the ability to monitor the anticoagulant
effect.
Nonheparin anticoagulant options include argatroban, fondaparinux, bivalirudin, and the direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) rivaroxaban and apixaban.[38] Fondaparinux and DOACs are not licensed for the
treatment of HIT. However, fondaparinux is known to be a safe anticoagulant for prophylaxis (in patients
without HIT or with remote HIT).
Despite rare reports of fondaparinux-induced HIT, observational studies report the successful use of
fondaparinux to treat HIT, and it is considered to be a nonheparin anticoagulant.[2] [3] A history of
fondaparinux-induced HIT should be ruled out before use.
Accumulated observational evidence suggests that the DOACs rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran
may be safe and effective for the treatment of HIT.[59] [60] Most published reports have been for
rivaroxaban.[61] [62] Edoxaban has been reported in a single case study for treatment of HIT, so it cannot
be recommended for use for this indication.[63] However, edoxaban is known to be a safe anticoagulant
for prophylaxis (in patients without HIT or with remote HIT).
Cardiac surgery or PCI[38]
• Nonurgent cardiac surgery should be delayed until the patient is HIT antibody negative (i.e.,
approximately 60-100 days depending on the type of HIT assay used).[38] Options for these
patients include argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, or a DOAC (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or
dabigatran).[38]
• Once scheduled, heparin can be used during cardiac surgery in patients with a previous history of
HIT if HIT antibodies are negative, but exposure to heparin should be limited to the procedure with
nonheparin anticoagulants used perioperatively.
• In those requiring urgent cardiac surgery, bivalirudin is indicated. Use is generally limited to the
procedure with other nonheparin alternatives used perioperatively.
• Patients requiring PCI should be treated with bivalirudin, or, alternatively, argatroban as a second-
line option.
Renal impairment[38]
• Argatroban is the preferred nonheparin anticoagulant in patients with renal insufficiency. Bivalirudin
is an alternative option (a dose reduction may be required).
• Argatroban can also be used in patients who require renal replacement therapy. Bivalirudin is
an alternative option (a dose reduction may be required). Hemodialysis with regional citrate
anticoagulation or saline flushes may be used instead of nonheparin anticoagulants once platelets
have normalized.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women[44] [45] [64]
• None of the nonheparin anticoagulants are approved for use in pregnant or breast-feeding women.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Management
• Danaparoid and fondaparinux have been used in this setting; however, there are limited data
available to support this practice. Danaparoid is not available in the US.
Suspected HIT with 4Ts score ≤3
A low 4Ts score (i.e., ≤3) alone has high negative predictive value; guidelines recommend against
laboratory testing in these patients.[38] [44] [45]
Heparin (including LMWH) can be continued as needed if:
• there is NO uncertainty about the 4Ts score, and/or
• the clinician decides that a HIT assay is not necessary.
Testing for HIT should be considered if:[38] [46]
• there is uncertainty about the score (e.g., multiple missing platelet counts, history of recent heparin
exposure is unclear, concurrent potential causes of thrombocytopenia).
Heparin should be stopped immediately if:
• clinical suspicion is sufficiently high to warrant the clinician ordering an assay.
While awaiting assay results, an alternative nonheparin anticoagulant can be started in those patients
requiring ongoing anticoagulation. DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or dabigatran) and fondaparinux are
preferred (depending on the indication) over argatroban or bivalirudin until HIT is confirmed, because they
have a lower risk of bleeding and are less costly.
Platelet recovery
Platelet recovery is generally said to have occurred when platelet levels have returned to >150 × 10⁹/
L, or to the patient’s previous baseline platelet count if it was <150 × 10⁹/L. The duration of treatment
for confirmed HIT is controversial. In patients with HIT-provoked thrombosis, 3 months of nonheparin
anticoagulant therapy is reasonable. In patients without thrombosis, nonheparin anticoagulant therapy
should continue at least until platelet recovery.[38] [45]
Platelet recovery indicates that ongoing thrombin generation has been halted. The American Society of
Hematology (ASH) refers to the state after platelet recovery, but prior to the functional assay becoming
negative, as subacute HIT A.[38] Treatment options for subacute HIT A in nonpregnant patients include
DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran); vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) are an alternative.[38]
Warfarin is considered safe to use during breast-feeding. DOACs should not be taken during breast-
feeding because of uncertainty about transfer into breast milk. Warfarin should be started at a low dose
only after platelet recovery and overlapped with argatroban, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux for a minimum of
5 days until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic. Argatroban prolongs the INR; therefore,
a specialist should be consulted for guidance on switching to warfarin. Overlap is not required when
switching from DOACs to warfarin; however, switching between oral anticoagulants should be done under
specialist guidance and take individual patient circumstances into account.
Fondaparinux is another option for ongoing treatment; however, it requires subcutaneous injections. It
is preferred over warfarin in pregnant women, but data on its safety are limited. A specialist should be
consulted for guidance on overlapping with fondaparinux because the time course will differ depending on
the initial anticoagulant.

negative predictive value; guidelines recommend
against laboratory testing in these patients.[38]
[44] [45]
» Heparin (including low molecular weight
heparin [LMWH]) can be continued as needed
if there is NO uncertainty about the 4Ts score,
and/or the clinician decides that a HIT assay is
not necessary.
» Testing for HIT should be considered if there
is uncertainty about the score (e.g., multiple
missing platelet counts, history of recent heparin
exposure is unclear, concurrent potential causes
of thrombocytopenia).[38] [46]
» Heparin should be stopped immediately if
clinical suspicion is sufficiently high to warrant
the clinician ordering an assay.
» While awaiting assay results, an alternative
nonheparin anticoagulant can be started in those
requiring ongoing anticoagulation. Direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs; rivaroxaban, apixaban,
or dabigatran) and fondaparinux are preferred
(depending on the indication) over argatroban or
bivalirudin until HIT is confirmed, because they
have a lower risk of bleeding and are less costly.

have been for rivaroxaban.[61] [62] Edoxaban
has only been reported in a single case study for

» Platelet recovery is generally said to have
occurred when platelet levels have returned
to >150 × 10⁹/L, or to the patient’s previous
baseline platelet count if it was <150 × 10⁹/L.
» The duration of treatment for confirmed HIT
is controversial. In patients with HIT-provoked
thrombosis, 3 months of anticoagulant therapy
is reasonable. In patients without thrombosis,
nonheparin anticoagulant therapy should
continue at least until platelet recovery.[38] [45]
» Platelet recovery indicates that ongoing
thrombin generation has been halted. The
American Society of Hematology refers to
the state after platelet recovery, but prior to
the functional assay becoming negative, as
subacute HIT A.[38] Treatment options for
subacute HIT A in nonpregnant patients include
direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; rivaroxaban,
apixaban, dabigatran); vitamin K antagonists
(e.g., warfarin) are an alternative.[38]

» Warfarin is considered safe to use during
breast-feeding. DOACs should not be used
during breast-feeding because of uncertainty
about transfer into breast milk. Warfarin should
be started at a low dose only after platelet
recovery and overlapped with argatroban,
bivalirudin, or fondaparinux for a minimum
of 5 days until the international normalized
ratio (INR) is therapeutic. Argatroban prolongs
the INR; therefore, a specialist should be
consulted for guidance on switching to warfarin.
Overlap is not required when switching from
DOACs to warfarin; however, switching between
oral anticoagulants should be done under
specialist guidance and take individual patient
circumstances into account.
» Fondaparinux is another option for ongoing
treatment; however, it requires subcutaneous
injections. It is preferred over warfarin in
pregnant women, but data on its safety are
limited. A specialist should be consulted for
guidance on overlapping with fondaparinux
because the time course will differ depending on
the initial anticoagulant.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Management
Emerging
Plasmapheresis
Proposed as a treatment strategy in patients with a recent history of HIT who require cardiopulmonary
bypass surgery, and in patients with active HIT who are not responding to standard therapy. The evidence to
date consists of retrospective case reports.[66] [67]
Intravenous immune globulin
Case reports suggest that high dose intravenous immune globulin can be considered for severe HIT that is
refractory to standard treatments.[67][68]
Primary prevention
The best way to prevent HIT is to minimize or avoid heparin exposure. Direct oral anticoagulants such as
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban may be used as alternatives for thromboprophylaxis for
some indications (e.g., following elective hip or knee arthroplasty).
Secondary prevention
The safety of prolonged re-exposure to unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or,
more rarely, fondaparinux in patients with a previous history of HIT (i.e., currently HIT antibody negative) is
unknown. Short-term exposure (<4 days) has been safely used in patients who require cardiac procedures
and whose tests are currently negative for HIT antibodies. In general, avoidance of exposure to heparin is
recommended in patients with a past history of HIT.
Anticoagulants such as fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, argatroban, or
bivalirudin may be reasonable alternatives to heparin in a patient with a past history of HIT depending on the
clinical situation. Regional citrate anticoagulation may be an option in patients with a past history of HIT who
require renal replacement.
Patient discussions
Patients should consider adding "heparin allergy" to their list of drug allergies.
Patients should consider obtaining a medical alert bracelet to notify healthcare professionals in an
emergency situation that they should not receive heparin or low molecular weight heparin.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
new venous or arterial thrombotic event short term high
The risk of thrombosis in a patient with untreated HIT during the initial period is 30% to 50%, including a
5% to 10% risk of thrombotic death.[38] Treatment with nonheparin anticoagulants appears to reduce the
risk of thrombosis by 50% to 70%.[44]
treatment-related bleeding short term high
The risk of major bleeding during treatment with nonheparin anticoagulants varies significantly according
to the agent used and patient comorbidity (estimated range 3% to 14%).[44]
limb amputation short term low
Limb amputation is required in 6% to 10% of patients with confirmed HIT.[56]
To date, none of the nonheparin anticoagulants have been shown to reduce the risk of amputation in a
patient with limb ischemia secondary to HIT-provoked macro- and microthrombosis.
venous gangrene short term low
In the past, when vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) were used for treatment of HIT without concurrent
coverage with a nonheparin anticoagulant, protein C levels would fall faster than prothrombin levels, which
induced a prothrombotic state. This can lead to serious adverse events, such as warfarin-induced skin
necrosis and venous limb gangrene (distal ischemic limb necrosis in the absence of arterial occlusion).

Prognosis
Platelet recovery in patients with confirmed HIT typically occurs within 1 week (median 4 days) of appropriate
treatment, although it can take significantly longer in aggressive cases.[40] HIT antibodies are transient and
usually spontaneously resolve within 100 days. In patients who do not experience initial complications, there
are no known long-term implications of HIT other than the risk of recurrence on prolonged re-exposure to
heparins.

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
