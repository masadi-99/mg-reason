Peripheral arterial disease Overview
Summary
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis.
Most patients are asymptomatic.
Patients require aggressive risk factor control.
Long-term patency of lower-extremity revascularization should be monitored with a surveillance program.
First line of therapy for patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication is a supervised 12-week exercise program
and medication. Revascularization should be considered if these therapies fail.
Death from a cardiac cause has a relative risk of 3 to 6 in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
Definition
PAD includes a range of arterial syndromes that are caused by atherosclerotic obstruction of the lower-
extremity arteries.

Peripheral arterial disease Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) increases with age, beginning after 40 years of age.[2]
[3] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PAD, as defined by abnormal ankle-brachial
index of <0.90, was prevalent in 1.0% among a 40- to 49-year-old population. However, with increasing
age the prevalence increased.  [CDC: peripheral arterial disease fact sheet] (http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/
data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_pad.htm)  In the age group of 50-59 years the prevalence was around 3.0%
to 5.0%, in the age group of 60-69 years it was around 5.0%, and in those over the age of 80 years it was
>20.0% (and even >25.0% in men).
The prevalence is similar in the US to the rate in other developed countries. Of note, African-Americans have
a higher prevalence of PAD, even after accounting for other risk factors.[4]
In high-income countries, the prevalence of PAD is equal between women and men.[5] [6] PAD is often
under-recognized and undertreated and is a global public health issue.[3] [5] [7] The impact on patients' lives
cannot be overstated.[8]
Etiology
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis.[2] Rarer causes of
claudication are aortic coarctation, arterial fibrodysplasia, arterial tumor, arterial dissection, arterial embolism,
thrombosis, vasospasm, and trauma. Other rare causes are Takayasu arteritis, temporal arteritis, thoracic
outlet obstruction, and Buerger disease. Adventitial cystic disease, occluded limb aneurysms, popliteal artery
entrapment, iliac endofibrosis, ergot toxicity, radiation fibrosis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis can also cause
PAD. These can usually be distinguished based on clinical history and examination.
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of PAD is as diverse as the diseases it encompasses, but it centers on damage,
inflammation, and structural defects of blood vessels. It includes atherosclerosis, degenerative diseases,
dysplastic disorders, vascular inflammation, and thrombosis as well as thromboembolism.
Other factors include deconditioning, metabolic changes such as accumulation of acylcarnitines and
adenosine diphosphate, impaired synthesis of phosphocreatine, and skeletal muscle injury characterized by
muscle fiber loss.[9]
Classification
Fontaine stages
There are 4 increasing stages of severity:[1]
• Stage I: asymptomatic
• Stage IIa: mild claudication
• Stage IIb: moderate to severe claudication
• Stage III: ischemia rest pain
• Stage IV: ulceration or gangrene.

Rutherford categories
There are a total of 7 increasing categories of severity:[1]
• Grade 0, category 0: asymptomatic
• Grade I, category 1: mild claudication
• Grade I, category 2: moderate claudication
• Grade I, category 3: severe claudication
• Grade II, category 4: ischemia rest pain
• Grade III, category 5: minor tissue loss
• Grade IV, category 6: major tissue loss.
Asymptomatic/claudication/critical limb ischemia/acute limb
ischemia
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Practice Guidelines use the following
divisions:[2]
Asymptomatic:
• Absence of leg claudication symptoms.
Chronic symptomatic PAD:
• Inadequate blood flow during exercise, causing fatigue, discomfort, or pain.
Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI):
• Compromise of blood flow to an extremity, causing limb pain at rest. Patients can develop ulcers or
gangrene.
Acute limb ischemia (ALI):
• A sudden decrease in limb perfusion that threatens limb viability. Associated with the "6 Ps": pain,
paralysis, paresthesias, pulselessness, pallor, and poikilothermia.
Case history
Case history #1
A 50-year-old male diabetic smoker presents with leg pain on exertion for 6 months. He notes bilateral calf
cramping with walking. He states that it is worse on his right calf than his left and that it goes away when
he stops walking. He has noticed that distance is more limited on an incline or if stairs are present.
Case history #2
A 75-year-old woman with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents with abnormal ankle-brachial index
on a routine screening. She is able to walk without any discomfort and is active.

Peripheral arterial disease Diagnosis
Approach
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is often under-recognized and undertreated.[3] [7] Many patients with PAD
are asymptomatic, but will have 1 or more risk factors.[2] [3] The resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the
initial diagnostic test for PAD.[2] It is recommended in all patients with suspected lower limb disease with a
history of exertional leg symptoms, nonhealing wounds/foot ulcers, or abnormal lower extremity pulse exam.
The toe brachial index (TBI) is useful in those patients where the ABI is unreliable (e.g., noncompressible
arteries in patients with diabetes and advancing age, as well as in many renal patients on dialysis). Other
tests used to establish diagnosis include:[2] [43]
• Segmental pressure examination
• Duplex ultrasound
• Pulse volume recording
• Continuous wave Doppler ultrasound
• Exercise ABI
• Computed tomography angiography (CTA)
• Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
• Angiography
Patients at risk
Classic claudication symptoms occur in a minority of patients and it is reasonable to measure the ABI in
people at increased risk of PAD but who have no history or physical exam. This includes people:[2]
• Ages 65 years or older
• Ages 50-64 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., diabetes mellitus, history of smoking,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension) or a family history of PAD
• Who are less than 50 years old with diabetes mellitus and one additional risk factor for
atherosclerosis
• With known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (e.g., coronary, carotid, subclavian,
renal, mesenteric artery stenosis, or abdominal aortic aneurysm).
Other symptoms and signs
Further symptoms and signs may lead to a diagnosis of PAD in the presence of risk factors:
• Calf or foot cramping with walking that is relieved with rest
• Thigh or buttock pain with walking that is relieved with rest
• Erectile dysfunction
• Pain worse in one leg
• Diminished pulse.
Critical limb ischemia should be suspected with the following:
• Foot pain at rest
• Gangrene
• Nonhealing wound/foot ulcer
• Muscle atrophy
• Dependent rubor
• Pallor when the leg is elevated
• Loss of hair over the dorsum of the foot

Peripheral arterial disease Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Thickened toenails
• Shiny/scaly skin.
Acute limb ischemia should be suspected with the following:[2]
• The classic 6 signs of acute limb ischemia, which are pain, paralysis, paresthesias, pulselessness,
poikilothermia, and pallor
• Symptom duration less than 2 weeks.
Ankle-brachial index
An ABI should be performed in patients who have symptoms or answered positively to a review of
questions regarding PAD.[44] An ABI ≤0.9 is diagnostic for the presence of PAD. The resting ABI should
be used to establish the diagnosis of PAD in patients with exertional low-extremity claudication, rest pain,
chronic limb ischemia, or nonhealing wounds/foot ulcers. It is an inexpensive and rapid office-based
test.[2] [3] ABI is performed by measuring the systolic pressure of the left and right brachial arteries and
the left and right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries pressure. The ABI is the highest of the dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial arteries' pressure divided by the higher of the left and right arm brachial artery
pulse pressure.
ABI may not be accurate in patients with noncompressible arteries, such as those with comorbid diabetes
mellitus or chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those on dialysis. Patients with either severely
stenotic or totally occluded arteries may also have normal ABI if there is abundant collateral system
present.[44] Diagnosis of PAD should not be excluded based on normal or raised ankle-brachial pressure
index alone in people with diabetes or CKD.[2] [45] The ABI is a marker of peripheral atherosclerosis as
well as a predictor of vascular events.[46]
Toe-brachial index
A TBI should be used to establish the diagnosis of PAD in patients in whom lower extremity PAD is
clinically suspected, but in whom the ABI test is not reliable due to noncompressible vessels, such as in
patients with comorbid diabetes or CKD, or those with advanced age. TBI should also be measured to
diagnose patients with suspected PAD when the resting ABI is >1.40.[2]
Additional tests to help diagnose PAD
Evaluation of the arterial pressure waveform using pulse volume recording via pneumoplethysmography
can add valuable information to the isolated ABI, particularly if the ABI is falsely elevated. Exercise ABIs
are also a valuable adjunct. An exercise ABI does not provide information about the location of the lesion.
It is useful, however, in establishing the diagnosis of lower extremity PAD in symptomatic patients when
resting ABIs are normal or borderline.[2] Walking limitations can be measured with exercise ABI, along
with the onset of symptoms, recovery time, and the total walking time.
Location and severity of PAD, using continuous wave Doppler ultrasound, is measured through a
decrease in pulsatility index between adjacent proximal and distal anatomic segments.
Pulsatility index is calculated as Vmax - Vmin/Vmean, where:
• Vmax = peak systolic velocity
• Vmin = minimum diastolic velocity
• Vmean = mean blood flow velocity.

Peripheral arterial disease Diagnosis
Location and magnitude of stenosis can be determined with segmental pressure examination, based on
pressure gradients between adjacent segments. Segmental pressure measurement may be artifactually
elevated in patients with noncompressible arteries.
Further tests
Depending on the patient's symptoms, other diagnostic tests may be needed, including a more thorough
assessment of the lower-extremity vasculature.[2] [3] If the ABI/TBI is abnormal and symptoms warrant
revascularization, the next test to guide the therapeutic decision is duplex ultrasonography of the lower-
extremity arteries.[47] The duplex ultrasound is cost-effective and noninvasive, and should be done first to
verify stenoses. This is most useful for counseling patients who may not have a minimally-invasive option
to treat mild or moderate claudication.
Computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and catheter
angiography can provide the anatomic detail necessary to determine a revascularization strategy and are
appropriate initial investigations for patients presenting with acute limb ischemia but require intravenous
contrast.[48] The spatial resolution of CTA and MRA may be lower than digital subtraction angiography.
• The location and degree of stenosis can also be assessed by duplex ultrasound. This is the
preferred and most widely used modality to assess stenoses.[47] The accuracy is diminished in
tortuous, calcified prosthetic bypass grafts, and in vessels with multiple stenoses. In the aortoiliac
arterial segment, accuracy can also be diminished due to bowel gas and body habitus.
• Visualization of tissue surrounding the artery using CTA can demonstrate stenosis due to
aneurysms, popliteal entrapment, or cystic adventitial disease that cannot be detected by
angiography.
• Revascularization can occur at the same time as catheter angiography. It is the only accepted
modality and is considered the investigation of choice for assessing vascular anatomy and
stenosis.
• Anatomic location and stenosis can be diagnosed using MRA, although patients with pacemakers,
defibrillators, and some cerebral aneurysm clips cannot be scanned safely. Gadolinium has caused
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
Evaluation for comorbidities and risk enhancers
The presence of specific comorbidities and risk factors increases the risk for major adverse
cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events in those with PAD, which may affect management
choices. Evaluation of patients with PAD should include assessment for:[2]
• Hypertension
• Dyslipidemia
• Diabetes
• CKD/end-stage renal disease
• Depression
• Atherosclerotic disease in more than one vascular bed (PAD, coronary artery disease,
cerebrovascular disease)
• Microvascular disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy)
• Current smoking/tobacco use
• Older age and geriatric syndromes (frailty, mobility impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition)

Peripheral arterial disease Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
asymptomatic (common)
• Most patients with peripheral arterial disease are asymptomatic, and diagnosis is based on risk
factors.
intermittent claudication (common)
• It is important to assess patients with detailed questions on walking impairment, claudication
symptoms, ischemic rest pain, or presence of nonhealing wound/foot ulcer. Classic claudication
symptoms occur in a minority of patients.
thigh or buttock pain with walking that is relieved with rest (common)
• Intermittent claudication can also occur in the larger muscle groups of the upper leg. This is indicative
of narrowing of the deep femoral artery or aorto-iliac level disease.
diminished or absent pulse (common)
• Key component of physical examination includes assessment of pulses in all extremities. Palpation
of pulses at the brachial, radial, ulnar, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial artery is
essential. Also, auscultation of carotid, femoral, and abdominal vessels is essential to assess for bruit.
sudden onset of severe leg pain accompanied by numbness, weakness, pale
and cold leg (uncommon)
• The classic 6 signs of acute limb ischemia are: pain, paralysis, paresthesias, pulselessness,
poikilothermia, and pallor.
Other diagnostic factors
erectile dysfunction (common)
• May be an early sign of peripheral arterial disease. Erectile dysfunction may be a symptom of aorto-
iliac atherosclerotic disease.[49]
leg pain at rest (uncommon)
• May be a sign of chronic limb-threatening ischemia.[2] The pain is severe and will be associated with
chronic ischemic signs on their physical exam. The pain is worse when the patient is supine and may
be better when the leg is dependent.
gangrene (uncommon)
• Necrosis that may involve one or more toes or other parts of the foot (i.e., heel). This is a sign of
chronic limb-threatening ischemia.[2]
nonhealing wound/ulcer (uncommon)
• A nonhealing wound/ulcer in the lower extremities below the level of the knee may be a sign of chronic
limb-threatening ischemia, particularly if it persists despite appropriate wound care.[2]

muscle atrophy (uncommon)
• Muscle atrophy of one lower extremity (reduced circumference compared with the contralateral
extremity) may be suggestive of peripheral arterial disease.[2]
dependent rubor (uncommon)
• Sign of critical limb ischemia.
pallor when the leg is elevated (uncommon)
• Sign of acute limb ischemia.[2]
loss of hair over the dorsum of the foot (uncommon)
• Suggestive of peripheral arterial disease.[2]
nail bed changes (uncommon)
• Suggestive of peripheral arterial disease.[2]
shiny/scaly skin (uncommon)
• Suggestive of peripheral arterial disease.[2] Due to loss of subcutaneous tissue.
pale extremity (uncommon)
• Sign of acute limb ischemia.[2]
nerve loss (uncommon)
• Sign of acute limb ischemia.[2]
Risk factors
Strong
smoking
• Because the most common etiology of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis, the
risk factors for PAD are similar to those of coronary artery disease (CAD).[2] However, smoking
is 2-3 times more likely to cause PAD than CAD.[3] Smoking is the most powerful predictor and
is independently associated with the development of PAD; an almost 4-fold increased risk of PAD
due to smoking has been reported (odds ratio per year 3.83, 95% CI 2.49 to 5.91). Additionally, a
dose-dependent association between smoking and the severity of PAD has been supported.[10]
Both active and passive cigarette smoking impair flow-mediated endothelium-dependent peripheral
arterial vasodilation (arterial stiffness). Smoking cessation is therefore essential to prevent disease
progression, as well as to decrease clinical deterioration (i.e., walking distance) and amputation
rates.[11] [12] [13] [14]
diabetes
• Diabetes is a risk factor for development and progression of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and they
are common comorbidities. In large epidemiology studies, diabetes has been shown to increase the
risk of PAD by 2- to 4-fold.[2] Diabetes increases the risk of intermittent claudication by 3- to 9-fold.
The risk is proportional to the severity and duration of diabetes. Diabetic PAD patients are 7-15 times

more likely to undergo limb amputation. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group showed that each
1% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin levels is associated with a 28% increased risk of incident PAD
and with a 28% increased risk of death, independent of other variables, such as blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, age, or smoking status. Thus, aggressive control of hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus is
essential to prevent disease progression and reduce cardiovascular risk.[15] [16] [17]
hypertension
• Hypertension is a common comorbidity; it is identified in 35% to 55% of patients with peripheral
arterial disease (PAD) at diagnosis.[18] It is a key risk factor for PAD, with odds ratios for hypertension
ranging from 1.5 to 2.2.[2] [19] In the Framingham Heart Study, PAD was increased by the severity of
hypertension and the risk of intermittent claudication overall was increased 2- to 4-fold.[20] An even
higher population risk attributable to hypertension of 41% was reported in the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study.[21] 
• Risk factor modifications should include control of blood pressure.[22] [23] The Heart Outcomes
Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study found that treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor ramipril was associated with a reduced risk of vascular death, myocardial infarction, and
stroke in a broad range of patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, including those
with PAD.[24] 
• The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes study demonstrated the superiority of intensive
over moderate blood pressure control.[25] Patients with diabetes receiving intensive antihypertensive
treatment had significantly fewer cardiovascular events compared with those patients on moderate
blood pressure-lowering treatment.
hyperlipidemia
• Elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a) have been
associated with increased risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).[2] Decreased levels of high-density
lipoprotein have also been associated with increased risk. The risk of PAD increased by 5% to 10%
for each 10 mg/dL rise in total cholesterol. Therefore, aggressive pharmacologic management of lipid
abnormalities in patients with PAD (e.g., with statins) is crucial.[26]
• Lowering LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels not only reduces the atherosclerosis burden in these patients
(thus decreasing disease progression), but also reduces cardiovascular event, morbidity, and mortality
rates.[2][27] 
• High-dose statin therapy has been shown to be more effective at preventing PAD than moderate-dose
therapy.[28]
age >40 years
• Prevalence increases from 0.9% in 40- to 49-year-olds to 14.5% in people over 70 years of age.[29]
history of coronary artery disease/cerebrovascular disease
• The same risk factors that predispose to coronary disease and stroke increase the risk of peripheral
arterial disease (PAD). A personal or family history of these conditions increases the risk of developing
PAD.[2]
low levels of exercise
• Individuals who do not get regular physical exercise are at increased risk of developing peripheral
arterial disease. Regular exercise also produces favourable alterations in cardiovascular risk factor
profile.[30]

Peripheral arterial disease Diagnosis
chronic kidney disease (CKD)
• Patients with CKD have an increased risk of developing peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the risk
increases with severity of renal impairment.[2] [31] Up to 25% of patients with CKD have PAD, and this
increases to 45% in those with end-stage renal disease.[2]
Weak
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)
• Physicians' Health Study found an increased risk of developing peripheral arterial disease in men with
elevated baseline levels of CRP.[32]
hyperhomocysteinemia
• An elevated homocysteine level is associated with an increased risk of peripheral arterial disease
(PAD).[33] [34] Elevated levels of homocysteine increase the risk of progression of PAD. There is,
however, no evidence to support treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in PAD.[33]
vasculitis/inflammatory conditions
• The presence of a vasculitis such as Buerger disease or Takayasu arteritis, particularly in combination
with smoking, can increase the risk of developing peripheral vascular disease.[35]
arterial fibrodysplasia
• This can affect any artery, but often involves the femoral, iliac, and popliteal arteries and can contribute
to peripheral vascular disease, particularly in younger patients.[36]

toe-brachial index (TBI)
• The TBI should be used to establish the diagnosis of peripheral
arterial disease (PAD) in patients in whom lower extremity PAD is
clinically suspected, but in whom the ankle-brachial index (ABI) test
is not reliable due to noncompressible vessels, such as in those with
comorbid diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or those with advanced
age.[2]
• TBI should be measured to diagnose patients with suspected PAD
when the ABI is >1.40.[2]
TBI <0.6
segmental pressure examination
• Arterial pressure can be measured with plethysmographic cuffs
sequentially placed along the limb at various levels.[2] Unlike the
ankle-brachial index, the segmental pressure analysis is able to
determine the location and magnitude of stenosis. It is also cheap
and quick.

not quantitative.[2]
• Diagnostic accuracy is in the range of 90% to 95%. May not be

• Pulsatility index might be normal distal to the stenosis, which can also
diminish test sensitivity.

CT angiogram
• Requires intravenous contrast, although there is less radiation than
with traditional angiography.[2] It can also reconstruct the images into
3D images. The new 64-slice CT can have sensitivity from 89% to
100% and specificity from 92% to 100% for >50% stenosis.
• However, its spatial resolution is lower than digital subtraction
angiography and venous opacification can obscure arterial filling.

magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
• MRA is useful to diagnose anatomic location and stenosis.[2]
Sensitivity and specificity of MRA in a meta-analysis to detect a
stenosis >50% was 90% to 100%, with the greatest accuracy when
gadolinium was used. However, it does have several limitations. MRA
tends to overestimate stenosis and occlusions. Metal clips can mimic
occlusions, thus limiting its use in postsurgical patients. Also, patients
with pacemakers, defibrillators, and some cerebral aneurysm clips
cannot be scanned safely.
• Gadolinium has caused nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with
chronic renal insufficiency.

Spinal stenosis • Patients with history of back
pain complain of hip, thigh,
buttock, or leg pain. It is
usually in a dermatomal
distribution and may be
associated with motor
weakness. The pain may
occur on standing alone
and is relieved by position
change such as sitting or
stooping forward (lumbar
spine flexion).
• Ankle-brachial index (ABI)
will be normal and exercise
ABI will show no decrease in
postexercise ABI.
• No significant disease seen
with arterial imaging tests.
• Plain spinal x-ray:
degenerative changes or
spondylolisthesis.
• MRI spine: compression of
the neural elements and soft
tissue.
Arthritis • Patients complain of hip,
thigh, or buttock pain that is
localized to hip and gluteal
region. It can occur at rest or
starts after exercise and is
not quickly relieved.
• Ankle-brachial index (ABI)
will be normal and exercise
ABI will show no decrease in

Screening
According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, it is reasonable to
measure the ankle-brachial index in people at increased risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) but who
have no history or physical exam findings suggestive of PAD.[2] This group comprises people:
• Who are aged ≥65 years
• Who are aged 50-64 years with risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., diabetes mellitus, history of
smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) or a family history of PAD
• Who are aged <50 years with diabetes mellitus and one additional risk factor for atherosclerosis
• With known atherosclerotic disease in another vascular bed (e.g., coronary, carotid, subclavian, renal,
mesenteric artery stenosis, or abdominal aortic aneurysm)

Peripheral arterial disease Management
Approach
All patients, regardless of their symptoms, should have aggressive risk factor modification including
management of blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes; smoking cessation; and diet and weight control.[1] [2]
[53]
Patients with mild-to-moderate claudication should be advised to keep walking, and people who are fit
enough should be encouraged to enrol in a structured exercise program.[30]
Antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin or clopidogrel) and high-intensity statin therapy are recommended for
all patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).[2] Use of low-dose rivaroxaban (a direct
oral anticoagulant [DOAC]) combined with low-dose aspirin reduces ischemic events compared with use
of aspirin alone, and is recommended as a treatment option for selected patients with symptomatic PAD;
however, this combination is associated with a higher risk of major bleeding.[1] [2] [54]
Evidence to guide management of patients with asymptomatic PAD is lacking but single antiplatelet therapy
should be considered based on the increased cardiovascular risk in this population, together with risk factor
modification and careful management of comorbidities.[2]
Acute limb ischemia
Acute limb ischemia is a medical emergency.[2] Patients who have sudden decrease in limb perfusion
with threatened tissue viability require urgent history and physical examination to determine symptom
onset. They need rapid assessment by a vascular surgeon with a view to restoring arterial blood flow as
soon as possible.[2] Emergency vascular study assessment should be performed with ankle-brachial
index or duplex ultrasound. 
Once the diagnosis is established, patients should be started on systemic anticoagulation with
unfractionated heparin, unless contraindicated, together with appropriate analgesia.[1] [2] For acute
ischemic pain, acetaminophen and an opioid (weak or strong) are recommended depending on the
severity of pain.[45] [55]
Etiologies of acute limb ischemia include embolic, progressive PAD with in situ thrombosis, bypass graft
thrombosis, arterial trauma, popliteal cyst or entrapment, hypercoagulable state, or phlegmasia cerulea
dolens.
Nonviable limb:
• These patients will have signs of tissue loss, nerve damage, and sensory loss and will require
amputation.
Viable limb:
• These patients will have no significant tissue loss, nerve damage, or significant sensory loss.
• Patients should have arterial anatomy defined and undergo revascularization.
• Options for revascularization include: percutaneous catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy;
percutaneous mechanical thrombus extraction or thrombo-aspiration (with or without thrombolysis);
and surgical thrombectomy, bypass, and/or arterial repair.[1] Endovascular therapy is often
preferred, especially in patients with severe comorbidities.[1]
• Evidence suggests that intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy is as effective as surgery and it has
become the modality of choice, with consideration of additional endovascular therapies as

required (e.g., for definitive treatment of any underlying culprit lesion).[2] Thrombolytic agents
include alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase.[56] Although there are several comparative
studies, no single thrombolytic agent or regimen has emerged as the treatment of choice.[57] [58]
 Streptokinase is no longer used due to lower efficacy, increased bleeding rate, and antigenicity
issues. 
Factors influencing choice of revascularization strategy include the presence of a neurologic deficit,
duration of ischemia, its localization and patient-specific anatomy, comorbidities, type of conduit (artery or
graft), risks related to treatment, and local resource availability.[1] [2]
Claudication (not lifestyle-limiting)
Patients with mild-to-moderate claudication should be advised to keep walking.[30]
For patients with claudication or any other degree of established PAD, antiplatelet therapy with or without
antithrombotic therapy (aspirin alone or clopidogrel alone, or low-dose rivaroxaban combined with low-
dose aspirin in selected patients with low bleeding risk) is recommended to reduce risk of myocardial
infarction, stroke, and vascular death.[2] 
Follow-up visits, at least annually, are required to monitor development of coronary, cerebrovascular, or
leg ischemic symptoms.[2]
Claudication (lifestyle-limiting)
Patients with lifestyle-limiting symptoms should undergo both a supervised exercise program and
pharmacologic therapy for symptom relief, in addition to antiplatelet therapy with or without antithrombotic
therapy (aspirin alone, or clopidogrel alone, or low-dose rivaroxaban combined with low-dose aspirin in
selected patients with low bleeding risk).[2]
Exercise therapy has been shown in multiple studies (but of limited quality) to improve walking time and
relieve symptoms.[30] [59]
A supervised exercise training program consists of 30-45 minutes per session, 3 times a week for 12
weeks. If supervised exercise therapy is not feasible, community-based walking programs have also
shown some benefit.[60]
Symptom relief can be achieved with cilostazol.[2] [61] Cilostazol may improve pain-free walking distance
in patients with intermittent claudication. However, participants taking cilostazol had higher odds of
experiencing headache.[62] [63] One meta-analysis demonstrated that the addition of cilostazol to
antiplatelet therapy after peripheral vascular interventions is associated with a reduced risk of restenosis,
amputation, and target lesion revascularization.[64] Cilostazol also reduces angiographic restenosis
after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for femoropopliteal lesions.[65] Cilostazol is
contraindicated in patients with heart failure of any severity. Patients taking cilostazol should be assessed
for benefit 3 months after starting treatment, and treatment ceased if there is not a clinically-relevant
improvement in walking distance. 
If there is clinical improvement with an exercise program and medication, follow-up visits are
recommended. However, if there is no improvement, patients should be referred to a vascular specialist
and have their anatomy defined and assessed for revascularization. One Cochrane review found that
revascularization does not provide significant benefits compared with exercise therapy alone in terms of
functional performance or quality of life; however, revascularization in combination with a conservative
therapy of supervised exercise or pharmacotherapy may result in greater improvements compared with

conservative therapy alone.[66] [67] Intervention for claudication should be carefully considered, as there
is potential for complication from any procedure, and the natural history of claudication is not aggressive.
Some patients choose to take a herbal supplement (L-arginine, propionyl L-carnitine, ginkgo biloba).
However, the clinical benefit of these supplements is not established.[68][69]
Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI)
These patients have symptoms such as ischemic rest pain, gangrene, or nonhealing wounds/foot and
leg ulcers; symptoms are present for more than 2 weeks.[2] For these patients, ischemic etiology must
be established urgently by physical exam and vascular studies. If patients have documented PAD, they
should be immediately referred to a vascular specialist for revascularization.
Risk stratification may be considered based on the Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WiFi) score.[50]
Patients who have been able to walk before the episode of critical limb ischemia, have a life expectancy of
>1 year, and are able to withstand surgery may be candidates for revascularization.
In patients with inoperable chronic critical limb ischemia facing amputation of the leg, spinal cord
stimulation may be a helpful treatment option in addition to standard conservative treatment. There
is evidence that spinal cord stimulation is associated with higher rates of limb salvage and more
prominent pain relief compared with standard conservative treatment alone.[70] There may be some trial
evidence for autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation as an option for patients with critical limb
ischemia.[71] However, other studies have failed to show benefit.[72]
If the patient is not a candidate for revascularization, they should be assessed for amputation where
necessary and be on appropriate risk factor reduction medication.
Revascularization referral
The following patients should be referred to a vascular specialist to have their anatomy defined and
assessed:
• Patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication who continue to have limiting symptoms despite exercise
and medication
• Patients with critical limb ischemia symptoms (ischemic rest pain, gangrene, nonhealing wounds/
foot ulcers)
• Patients with acute limb ischemia (sudden decrease in limb perfusion with threatened tissue
viability)
Revascularization is recommended if patients have lifestyle-limiting claudication, and have failed to
achieve benefit from medications combined with an exercise program. Endovascular and surgical
procedures should not be performed in patients with PAD solely to prevent progression to chronic limb
ischemia.[2]
Endovascular or surgical revascularization
Endovascular techniques include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with balloon dilation, stents,
atherectomy, laser, cutting balloons, and drug-coated balloons.[73] [74]
For aortoiliac disease, endovascular revascularization is frequently the first choice with surgery reserved
for extensive obstructions and lesions treated unsuccessfully with an endovascular procedure, but

individual patient factors including treatment preferences should inform the selection of revascularization
technique.[1] [2]
Surgical endarterectomy or a hybrid approach (surgical and endovascular procedures in combination) is
frequently performed for common femoral artery lesions.[1] [2] Common femoral endarterectomy has a
high patency rate but may be associated with significant complications.[75]
For femoropopliteal artery stenosis, endovascular therapy is frequently performed but surgical
endarterectomy is reasonable if perioperative risk is acceptable and technical factors suggest advantages
over endovascular approaches.[1] [2]
For infrapopliteal artery lesions, endovascular treatment has been limited to threatened limb loss only, but
evidence to support either surgical or endovascular approaches is lacking.[2] Surgical revascularization to
tibial targets has a primary patency at 1, 3, and 5 years of 66%, 59%, and 55%, respectively.[76]
Regardless of the procedure selected, all patients undergoing surgical or endovascular revascularization
should receive lifelong aspirin treatment.[1] [77] There is evidence to support the addition of low-
dose rivaroxaban to aspirin post-revascularization (endovascular and surgical), but this combination is
associated with a higher risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin alone.[2] [78] [79]
Current evidence has not yet established whether bypass surgery or endovascular intervention is superior
for initial treatment for critical limb ischemia, although many operators have adopted an "endovascular
first" strategy.[80] [81] Care must be individualized to the patient.
Considerations for common comorbidities and risk enhancers
The presence of specific comorbidities and risk factors increases the risk for major adverse
cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events in those with PAD. Multisociety US guidelines
recommend that patients with PAD should be assessed for these risk amplifiers when developing patient-
focused treatment recommendations.[2]
• Hypertension
• Dyslipidemia
• Diabetes
• CKD/end-stage renal disease
• Depression
• Atherosclerotic disease in more than one vascular bed (PAD, coronary artery disease,
cerebrovascular disease)
• Microvascular disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy)
• Current smoking/tobacco use
• Older age and geriatric syndromes (frailty, mobility impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition)
Decisions on revascularization approach (surgical vs. endovascular) and assessment for amputation
will be affected by the presence of comorbidities and risk amplifiers.[2] Coordination of care across
multispeciality teams is important for management of these patients.
Recommendations for managing specific comorbidities
Hypertension
• Antihypertensive therapy is recommended in patients with PAD and hypertension to reduce risk of
major adverse cardiovascular events.

Peripheral arterial disease Management
• Multisociety US guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg in those with
PAD and hypertension.[2] European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend a target systolic
blood pressure of 120-129 mmHg, if tolerated.[1]
• No one class of antihypertensive medication or strategy is superior for lowering blood pressure in
patients with PAD; however, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have been shown
to reduce risk of cardiovascular events and are generally preferred.[1] [2]
Dyslipidemia
• Lipid-lowering therapy with high-intensity statin therapy is recommended in all patients with PAD
to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events. Multisociety US
guidelines recommend a target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of <70 mg/dL.[2]
 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend a target of <55 mg/dL.[1]
• In those with PAD on maximally tolerated statin therapy and with LDL-C below target, additional
lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitor may be considered.[1] [2]
• For patients who have high-risk PAD and elevated triglycerides despite lifestyle changes and
statin therapy, European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide a weak recommendation for
the addition of icosapent ethyl.[1] The US National Lipid Association also recommends addition of
icosapent ethyl for patients ages 45 years or older with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease and elevated triglycerides who are already on high-intensity or maximally tolerated statin
therapy.[82]
Diabetes
• Patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of PAD progression and have an increased risk
of major adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events. A guideline-based
program of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with diabetes and PAD
is recommended, including glycemic control, foot care and ulcer prevention, management of
diet and weight, and control of cardiovascular risk factors.[2] Glycemic control may improve limb
outcomes.[2]
• In those with PAD and type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycemic control with a glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) receptor agonist (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide) and/or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2
(SGLT2) inhibitor (e.g., canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) may be preferred, as they have
been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.[1] [2]
• Coordination of care is essential in patients with diabetes and PAD.[2]
Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
• The presence of comorbid CKD in patients with PAD increases the risk of major adverse
cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events. Those with end-stage renal disease are
at higher risk of lower extremity amputation and readmission after revascularization.[2] In those
being considered for revascularization, an endovascular approach may be preferred over a surgical
approach.
• Some drugs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and a dose adjustment
may be required. Some drugs may also be contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Check
your local drug information source for more information.
Depression
• Depression and other mental health issues such as anxiety and stress are common comorbidities
in those with PAD.[2]

Peripheral arterial disease Management
MANAGEMENT
• The presence of depressive symptoms has been associated with an increased risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events in patients with PAD; screening for
depression is recommended.[2]
Coronary artery disease (CAD)
• The same risk factors that predispose to coronary disease increase the risk of PAD. Measures
taken to treat coronary disease may also benefit patients with PAD.
• CAD is an important comorbidity; it is a similar disease process to PAD in a different vascular bed.
Patients with PAD and CAD have a high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events; screening for
coronary disease is recommended, with optimization of medical therapy.[1] [2] Management of PAD
is not generally altered in the presence of chronic coronary disease. 
• See Chronic coronary disease .
Atrial fibrillation (AF)
• In patients with PAD and AF, long-term anticoagulant therapy is recommended for reduction of
ischemic stroke and other ischemic events.[83] Oral anticoagulant monotherapy (preferably with a
DOAC) without use of an antiplatelet agent is recommended for many patients with stable PAD.[1]
[83]
• In patients with PAD and AF who are undergoing revascularization (endovascular or surgical),
addition of a single antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel is preferred) to long-term oral anticoagulation
may be considered temporarily (1-3 months), taking bleeding risk into account.[1] [83] [84]
• See Established atrial fibrillation .
Heart failure
• Patients with PAD and comorbid heart failure have an increased risk of major adverse
cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.
• European Society of Cardiology guidelines note that evaluation of left ventricular function in those
with PAD may be useful for cardiovascular risk stratification and disease management, which may
be important when an intermediate- or high-risk vascular intervention is planned.[1]
• Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with heart failure of any severity.

Acute
acute limb ischemia
1st urgent assessment for revascularization
or amputation
» Acute limb ischemia is a medical
emergency.[2]
» Patients who have sudden decrease in limb
perfusion with threatened tissue viability require
urgent history and physical examination to
determine symptom onset. They need rapid
assessment by a vascular surgeon with a
view to restoring arterial blood flow as soon
as possible.[2] Emergency vascular study
assessment should be performed with ankle-
brachial index or duplex ultrasound. If there
is severe peripheral arterial disease, then the
patient should immediately be assessed for
etiology of acute limb ischemia.[2]
» Nonviable limb: these patients will have signs
of tissue loss, nerve damage, and sensory loss
and will require amputation.
» Viable limb: these patients will have no
significant tissue loss, nerve damage or
significant sensory loss. Patients should
have arterial anatomy defined and undergo
revascularization.
» Factors influencing choice of revascularization
strategy include the presence of a neurologic
deficit, duration of ischemia, its localization
and patient-specific anatomy, comorbidities,
type of conduit (artery or graft), risks related to
treatment, and local resource availability.[1] [2]

US guidelines recommend that patients
with PAD should be assessed for these risk
amplifiers when developing patient-focused
treatment recommendations.[2] These risk
amplifiers include (in addition to hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes) chronic kidney
disease, depression, atherosclerotic disease
in more than one vascular bed, microvascular
disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy),
and older age and geriatric syndromes (frailty,
mobility impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition).
Decisions on initial revascularization versus
medical therapy with anticoagulation
(unfractionated heparin) and monitoring
approach and assessment for amputation will
be affected by the presence of comorbidities
and risk amplifiers.[2] Coordination of care
across multispeciality teams is important for
management of these patients.

any underlying culprit lesion may include
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with
balloon dilation or stents.[73] [74]
adjunct surgical revascularization
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» For patients with a viable limb who
continue to have symptoms, revascularization
is recommended. Options for surgical
revascularization include surgical thrombectomy,
bypass, and/or arterial repair.[1]
» For aortoiliac disease, endovascular
revascularization is frequently the first choice,
with surgery reserved for extensive obstructions
and lesions treated unsuccessfully with an
endovascular procedure, but individual patient
factors including treatment preferences should
inform the selection of revascularization
technique.[1] [2]
» Surgical endarterectomy or a hybrid approach
(surgical and endovascular procedures in
combination) is frequently performed for
common femoral artery lesions.[1] [2] Common
femoral endarterectomy has a high patency
rate but may be associated with significant
complications.[75]
» For femoropopliteal artery stenosis,
endovascular therapy is frequently performed
but surgical endarterectomy is reasonable if
perioperative risk is acceptable and technical
factors suggest advantages over endovascular
approaches.[1] [2]
» For infrapopliteal artery lesions, endovascular
treatment has been limited to threatened limb
loss only, but evidence to support either surgical
or endovascular approaches is lacking.[2]
 Surgical revascularization to tibial targets has
a primary patency at 1, 3, and 5 years of 66%,
59%, and 55%, respectively.[76]

plus risk factor modification
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with peripheral arterial disease
(PAD) have significantly increased risk of
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and it
is crucial to modify their cardiovascular risk
factors. All PAD patients should have aggressive
risk factor modification, regardless of their
symptoms. This should include: control of blood
pressure; guideline-directed management for
patients with diabetes; lipid-lowering therapy;
cessation of smoking; dietary advice to reduce
cardiovascular disease risk and control weight;
and increased exercise.[1] [2]
» Blood pressure control: antihypertensive
therapy is recommended in patients with
PAD and hypertension to reduce risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events. Multisociety US
guidelines recommend a target blood pressure
of <130/80 mmHg.[2] European Society of
Cardiology guidelines recommend a target
systolic blood pressure of 120-129 mmHg, if
tolerated.[1] No one class of antihypertensive
medication or strategy is superior for lowering
blood pressure in PAD; however, ACE inhibitors
or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have been
shown to reduce risk of cardiovascular events
and are generally preferred.[1] [2]
» Lipid-lowering therapy: high-intensity statin
therapy is recommended in all patients with PAD
to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events
and major adverse limb events. Multisociety
US guidelines recommend a target low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of <70
mg/dL.[2] European Society of Cardiology
guidelines recommend a target of <55 mg/
dL.[1] In those with PAD on maximally tolerated
statin therapy and with LDL-C below target,
additional lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe
or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type
9 (PCSK9) inhibitor may be considered.[1] [2] In
patients who have high-risk PAD and elevated
triglycerides despite lifestyle changes and
statin therapy, European Society of Cardiology
guidelines provide a weak recommendation
for addition of icosapent ethyl.[1] The US
National Lipid Association also recommends
addition of icosapent ethyl for patients ages 45
years or older with established atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and elevated triglycerides

patients with PAD and AF who are undergoing
revascularization (endovascular or surgical),
addition of a single antiplatelet agent (preferably
clopidogrel) to long-term oral anticoagulation
may be considered temporarily (1-3 months),
taking bleeding risk into account.[1] [83] [84]

patients, see Established atrial fibrillation .
plus risk factor modification
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with peripheral arterial disease
(PAD) have significantly increased risk of
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and it
is crucial to modify their cardiovascular risk
factors. All PAD patients should have aggressive
risk factor modification, regardless of their
symptoms. This should include: control of blood
pressure; guideline-directed management for
patients with diabetes; lipid-lowering therapy;
cessation of smoking; dietary advice to reduce
cardiovascular disease risk and control weight;
and increased exercise.[1] [2]
» Blood pressure control: antihypertensive
therapy is recommended in patients with
PAD and hypertension to reduce risk of major
adverse cardiovascular events. Multisociety US
guidelines recommend a target blood pressure
of <130/80 mmHg.[2] European Society of
Cardiology guidelines recommend a target
systolic blood pressure of 120-129 mmHg, if
tolerated.[1] No one class of antihypertensive
medication or strategy is superior for lowering
blood pressure in PAD; however, ACE inhibitors
or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have been
shown to reduce risk of cardiovascular events
and are generally preferred.[1] [2]

» Lipid-lowering therapy: high-intensity statin
therapy is recommended in all patients with PAD
to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events
and major adverse limb events. Multisociety
US guidelines recommend a target low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of <70
mg/dL.[2] European Society of Cardiology
guidelines recommend a target of <55 mg/
dL.[1] In those with PAD on maximally tolerated
statin therapy and with LDL-C below target,
additional lipid-lowering therapy with ezetimibe
or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type
9 (PCSK9) inhibitor may be considered.[1] [2] In
patients who have high-risk PAD and elevated
triglycerides despite lifestyle changes and
statin therapy, European Society of Cardiology
guidelines provide a weak recommendation
for addition of icosapent ethyl.[1] The US
National Lipid Association also recommends
addition of icosapent ethyl for patients ages 45
years or older with established atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and elevated triglycerides
who are already on high-intensity or maximally
tolerated statin therapy.[82]
» Diabetes management: a guideline-
based program of pharmacologic and
nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with
diabetes and PAD is recommended, including
glycemic control, foot care and ulcer prevention,
management of diet and weight, and control of
cardiovascular risk factors.[2] In those with PAD
and type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycemic control
with a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor
agonist (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide) and/
or a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitor (e.g., canagliflozin, dapagliflozin,
empagliflozin) may be preferred, as they have
been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse
cardiovascular events.[1] [2] Coordination of care
is essential in patients with diabetes and PAD.[2]
» Additionally, the presence of specific
comorbidities and risk factors increases the risk
for major adverse cardiovascular events and
major adverse limb events in those with PAD.
Multisociety US guidelines recommend that
patients with PAD should be assessed for these
risk amplifiers when developing patient-focused
treatment recommendations.[2] These risk
amplifiers include (in addition to hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes) chronic kidney
disease, depression, atherosclerotic disease
in more than one vascular bed, microvascular
disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy),
and older age and geriatric syndromes (frailty,
mobility impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition).

Decisions on revascularization approach
(surgical vs. endovascular) and assessment for
amputation will be affected by the presence of
comorbidities and risk amplifiers.[2] Coordination
of care across multispeciality teams is important
for management of these patients.
adjunct endovascular revascularization
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Endovascular techniques include: balloon
dilation (angioplasty); stents; and atherectomy.
» These techniques continue to evolve and
now include covered stents, drug-eluting stents,
cutting balloons, and drug-coated balloons.[87]
» The technique chosen will relate to lesion
characteristics (e.g., anatomic location, lesion
length, degree of calcification) and operator
experience.
» For aortoiliac disease, endovascular
revascularization is frequently the first choice,
with surgery reserved for extensive obstructions
and lesions treated unsuccessfully with an
endovascular procedure, but individual patient
factors including treatment preferences should
inform the selection of revascularization
technique.[1] [2]
» Surgical endarterectomy or a hybrid approach
(surgical and endovascular procedures in
combination) is frequently performed for
common femoral artery lesions.[1] [2] Common
femoral endarterectomy has a high patency
rate but may be associated with significant
complications.[75]
» For femoropopliteal artery stenosis,
endovascular therapy is frequently performed
but surgical endarterectomy is reasonable if
perioperative risk is acceptable and technical
factors suggest advantages over endovascular

Peripheral arterial disease Management
Emerging
Therapeutic angiogenesis
Therapeutic angiogenesis (administration of vascular growth factors) has emerged as a possible alternative
treatment for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Preliminary evidence suggests that autologous bone marrow
mononuclear cells implantation in PAD patients with critical limb ischemia may improve lower limb ischemic
symptoms.[90] [91] This is also supported by the results of two systematic reviews.[92] [93] However, further
data from larger studies are required before reaching any firm conclusions.
Balloon catheter
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Lutonix® 035 drug-coated balloon percutaneous
transluminal angioplasty (PTA) catheter, the IN.PACT Admiral® paclitaxel-coated PTA balloon catheter, and
the Stellarex® drug-coated angioplasty balloon for the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions.[94] [95] [96] [97]
 These drug-coated balloons may improve long-term angioplasty outcomes. However, one Cochrane review
found that current evidence is insufficient to prove this.[98]  Furthermore, one meta-analysis found a signal
for increased mortality in patients treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons and stents.[99] This has led the
FDA to issue a warning advising that patients who have been treated with these devices should be diligently
monitored, and that clinical studies should continue.[100] 
Vorapaxar
Vorapaxar is a protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antagonist that acts as a potent antiplatelet agent. In
clinical trials that included patients with recent myocardial infarction or PAD, the addition of vorapaxar on a
background of aspirin and/or clopidogrel was associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular
events during long-term follow-up. A subgroup analysis of patients with PAD also suggested that vorapaxar
was associated with a reduction in acute limb ischemia.[101] Vorapaxar is approved by the FDA for the
reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of PAD.
Intravascular lithotripsy
Intravascular lithotripsy is a technique that involves using pressure waves to soften arterial plaque in calcified
peripheral arterial disease, which may have benefit in selected patients with calcified arteries.[102] [103]
 Further studies are needed.[104]
Primary prevention
The most important preventive actions involve combined dietary and lifestyle modifications (stopping
smoking; increasing physical activity; losing weight; increasing consumption of fish, fruits, vegetables, fiber,
and nuts; reducing salt intake).[37]
Smoking is a leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death; even low levels of smoking
increase risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).[37] [38] Support programs, medications,
and alternative therapies are available. In adults who use tobacco, a combination of behavioral interventions
plus pharmacotherapy is recommended.[37] Secondhand smoke exposure should be avoided.[37]
Routine and/or opportunistic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors with calculation of 10-year risk of
ASCVD should be used to guide decisions on treatment with preventive therapies (e.g., statins).[37] [39] 
Although weight loss interventions improve cardiovascular risk factors (including weight, blood pressure,
lipids, insulin resistance) there is limited evidence of improved cardiovascular outcomes in weight loss
trials.[40] Given the imperfections of BMI as a risk marker, the limited efficacy of even multicomponent
lifestyle interventions in promoting sustained weight loss, and concern for weight stigma as a barrier to care,
providers might also focus on physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness rather than weight per se as a
treatment goal.

Peripheral arterial disease Management
MANAGEMENT
Among adults at borderline (5.0% to <7.5%) and intermediate (≥7.5% to <20.0%) risk, the American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) states that it is reasonable to use the following
additional individual risk-enhancing clinical factors to guide decisions about preventive therapy.[37]
• Family history of premature ASCVD (men, age <55 years; women, age <65 years)
• Primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 160-189 mg/dL [4.1 to 4.8
mmol/L]; non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] 190-219 mg/dL [4.9 to 5.6 mmol/L])
• Optimally, three determinations
• Metabolic syndrome (increased waist circumference [by ethnically appropriate cutpoints], elevated
triglycerides [>150 mg/dL, nonfasting], elevated blood pressure, elevated glucose, and low HDL-C [<40
mg/dL in men; <50 mg/dL in women] are factors; a tally of three makes the diagnosis)
• Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with or
without albuminuria; not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation)
• Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or HIV/AIDS
• History of premature menopause (before age 40 years) and history of pregnancy-associated
conditions that increase later ASCVD risk, such as preeclampsia
• High-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., South Asian ancestry)
• Lipids/biomarkers: associated with increased ASCVD risk
• Persistently elevated (optimally, three determinations) primary hypertriglyceridemia (≥175 mg/
dL, nonfasting)
• If measured: elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (≥2.0 mg/L)
• If measured: elevated lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)): A relative indication for its measurement is family
history of premature ASCVD. An Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL or ≥125 nmol/L constitutes a risk-enhancing
factor, especially at higher levels of Lp(a)
• If measured: elevated apolipoprotein B (apoB) (≥130 mg/dL). A relative indication for its
measurement is triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL. A level ≥130 mg/dL corresponds to an LDL-C >160
mg/dL and constitutes a risk-enhancing factor
• If measured: ankle-brachial index (ABI) (<0.9)
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults ages 40-75 years without ASCVD but
who have one or more cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking),
and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater, should be started on a statin for
primary prevention. Those with 10-year risk between 7.5% and 10.0% may selectively be offered a statin. For
patients who are 76 years or older there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against starting a statin
for primary prevention.[41]
Aspirin is no longer routinely recommended for primary prevention but may be considered in selected
patients for whom the absolute cardiovascular benefit outweighs the absolute risk of increased bleeding.[42]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) from the ACC/AHA.[37] Estimate CVD risk using a 10-year risk calculator, such as the Pooled
Cohort Equations (ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus).  Newer calculators such as PREVENT™ may yield fewer
treatment recommendations if applied at thresholds as outlined in the table below; adjustments to risk
thresholds may be required if using PREVENT™ in conjunction with the ACC/AHA primary prevention
guidance, although evidence to support this approach is limited.
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.

With overweight (BMI=25.0 to 29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle
interventions
Where feasible, refer patients for comprehensive
lifestyle interventions as part of a structured
program incorporating regular self-monitoring of
food intake, physical activity and weight.
The ACC/AHA state that high intensity (≥14
sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight-loss
interventions provided by a trained interventionist
work best. However, it is noted that other modalities,
such as electronically delivered weight-loss
programs with personalized feedback and some
commercial-based programs, have also shown
moderate results.
Consider whether to offer select patients, or refer
them for, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved pharmacologic therapies and bariatric
surgery, adjunctive to complementary lifestyle
interventions.
It is recommended that BMI is interpreted with
caution in people of Asian ancestry, older adults,
and muscular adults.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss; reduced waist circumference;
increased physical activity; reduced caloric
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Weight loss:
• The ACC/AHA define clinically meaningful
weight loss as ≥5% initial weight.
Waist circumference:
• Definitions of elevated waist circumference
are ≥40 inches (≥102 cm) in men and ≥35
inches (≥88 cm) in women.
Physical activity:
• Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic
physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥150
minutes/week (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on
most days of the week), is recommended for
initial weight loss
• Higher levels of physical activity,
approximately 200-300 minutes/week, are
recommended to maintain weight loss or
minimize weight regain after 1 year.
Reduced caloric intake:
• Caloric intake reduced by ≥500 kcal/day from
baseline, which often can be attained by
limiting women to 1200 to 1500 kcal/day and
men to 1500 to 1800 kcal/day
• A very-low-calorie diet (defined as <800
kcal/day) is recommended only in limited
circumstances and only by trained clinicians
in a medical care setting with the patient
under medical supervision

A maximally- tolerated statin is recommended for
all patients ages 20-75 years with severe primary

For patients age >75 years, statins are not routinely
recommended, but may be considered on a case-
by-case basis depending on the individual risk
status and potential for adverse effects.
Although statins are not routinely recommended
in young adults ages 20-39 years, they
may be considered in those with moderate
hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1

With risk-enhancing factors or high coronary artery calcium score, but no
hypercholesterolemia; ages 40-75 years
Intervention Goal
Consider a moderate-intensity statin
If risk-enhancing factors are present, have a risk
discussion with the patient regarding initiation of a
moderate-intensity statin.
Coronary artery calcium scoring is not routinely
used to guide treatment decisions in the borderline
risk group. However in select borderline risk adults it
may be used to guide decision making regarding the
need for a statin as follows.
• Coronary artery calcium score 0 Agatston
units (AU): reasonable to withhold a statin
and reassess in 5-10 years, providing higher
risk conditions (e.g., diabetes, family history
of premature CHD, cigarette smoking) are
absent
• Coronary artery calcium score 1-99 AU:
reasonable to initiate statin treatment for
patients age ≥55 years
• Coronary calcium score ≥100 AU or ≥75th
age/sex/race percentile: reasonable to initiate
a statin
For patients age >75 years, statins are not routinely
recommended; assessment of risk status and a
clinician-patient risk discussion is needed to decide
whether to continue or initiate statin treatment,
taking into account statin safety and the potential for
statin-associated adverse effects.

Peripheral arterial disease Management
With overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle
interventions
Where feasible, refer patients for comprehensive
lifestyle interventions as part of a structured
program incorporating regular self-monitoring of
food intake, physical activity and weight.
The ACC/AHA state that high intensity (≥14
sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight-loss
interventions provided by a trained interventionist
work best. However, it is noted that other modalities,
such as electronically delivered weight-loss
programs with personalized feedback and some
commercial-based programs, have also shown
moderate results.
Consider whether to offer select patients, or refer
for pharmacologic therapies and bariatric surgery,
adjunctive to complementary lifestyle interventions.
It is recommended that BMI is interpreted with
caution in people of Asian ancestry, older adults,
and muscular adults.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss; reduced waist circumference;
increased physical activity; reduced caloric
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Weight loss:
• The ACC/AHA define clinically meaningful
weight loss as ≥5% initial weight
Waist circumference:
• Definitions of elevated waist circumference
are ≥40 inches (≥102 cm) in men and ≥35
inches (≥88 cm) in women
Physical activity:
• Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic
physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥150
minutes/week (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on
most days of the week), is recommended for
initial weight loss
• Higher levels of physical activity,
approximately 200 to 300 minutes/week, are
recommended to maintain weight loss or
minimize weight regain after 1 year.
Reduced caloric intake:
• Caloric intake reduced by ≥500 kcal/day from
baseline, which often can be attained by
limiting women to 1200-1500 kcal/day and
men to 1500-1800 kcal/day
• A very-low-calorie diet (defined as <800
kcal/day) is recommended only in limited
circumstances and only by trained clinicians
in a medical care setting with the patient
under medical supervision

Peripheral arterial disease Management
MANAGEMENT
With moderate or severe hypercholesterolemia
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
A maximally-tolerated statin is recommended for
all patients ages 20-75 years with severe primary
hypercholesterolemia, regardless of estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk.
For patients age >75 years, statins are not routinely
recommended, but may be considered on a case-
by-case basis depending on the individual risk
status and potential for adverse effects.
Although statins are not routinely recommended
in young adults ages 20-39 years, they
may be considered in those with moderate
hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1
mmol/L]) where there is a positive family history of
premature ASCVD.

Peripheral arterial disease Management
Without severe primary cholesterolemia (LDL-C<190 mg/dL [<4.9 mmol/L]); ages 40-75 years
Intervention Goal
Consider a moderate-intensity statin,
following risk discussion
Have a risk discussion with the patient to decide
whether to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy.
Knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for all
patients but particularly for those at intermediate risk
(ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤20.0%). The presence of
risk-enhancing factors may lower the threshold for
statin initiation or intensification.
In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery
calcium scores may also be used to guide treatment
decisions as follows:
• Coronary artery calcium score 0 AU:
reasonable to withhold a statin and reassess
in 5-10 years, providing higher risk conditions
(e.g., diabetes, family history of premature
CHD, and cigarette smoking) are absent
• Coronary artery calcium score 1-99 AU:
reasonable to initiate statin treatment for
patients age ≥55 years
• Coronary calcium score ≥100 AU or ≥75th
age/sex/race percentile:reasonable to initiate
a statin
For patients age >75 years, statins are not routinely
recommended; assessment of risk status and a
clinician-patient risk discussion is needed to decide
whether to continue or initiate statin treatment,
taking into account statin safety and the potential for
statin-associated adverse effects.
Reduction in LDL-C by 30% to 49%; reduced overall
risk of ASCVD

Intervention Goal
kidney disease, a target blood pressure
<130/80 mmHg is usually recommended.
With comprehensive evaluation suggestive of a favorable risk:benefit ratio for prophylactic
aspirin; ages 40-70 years
Intervention Goal
Consider low-dose aspirin
To balance the benefits and risks, low-dose aspirin
is recommended only for select adults ages 40-70
years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at
increased bleeding risk, following shared decision
making.
The ACC/AHH notes that prophylactic aspirin
generally becomes more favorable for patients with
>10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. This is an
individualized decision:
• Contemporary data show that absolute
risk for ASCVD events typically exceeds
that of bleeding and, although the gap of
relative benefit to relative harm for aspirin
has narrowed, the number needed to treat
to prevent an ASCVD event remains lower
than the number needed to harm to cause
bleeding.
• Some patients, in discussion with their
clinician, may feel that the benefit of
prophylactic aspirin is comparable to the
risk and may instead choose to focus on
optimal control of other modifiable ASCVD
risk factors.
Consider risk enhancing factors ± coronary artery
score, where available, as part of the risk:benefit
analysis.
Prophylactic aspirin is not typically recommended
for:
• Adults age >70 years due to a potential risk of
harm, including increased risk of bleeding.
• Those age <40 years; there is insufficient
evidence to judge the risk:benefit ratio of
routine aspirin for the primary prevention of
ASCVD in this age group
Reduction of CVD risk
Reassess the appropriateness of treatment at
regular intervals, in case known risk factors for
increased bleeding develop which may alter the
risk:benefit assessment.
Consider treatment discontinuation at age 70 years;
prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults
age >70 years is potentially harmful, and is not
recommended on a routine basis.
Adults at high risk for ASCVD; without type 2 diabetes

Peripheral arterial disease Management
MANAGEMENT
Intervention Goal
• For those requiring pharmacologic treatment
for hypertension, including those with chronic
kidney disease, a target blood pressure
<130/80 mmHg is usually recommended.
With comprehensive evaluation suggestive of a favorable risk:benefit ratio for prophylactic
aspirin; ages 40-70 years
Intervention Goal
Consider low-dose aspirin
To balance the benefits and risks, low-dose aspirin
is recommended only for select adults ages 40-70
years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at
increased bleeding risk, following shared decision
making.
The ACC/AHH notes that prophylactic aspirin
generally becomes more favorable for patients with
>10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. This is an
individualized decision:
• Contemporary data show that absolute
risk for ASCVD events typically exceeds
that of bleeding and, although the gap of
relative benefit to relative harm for aspirin
has narrowed, the number needed to treat to
prevent an ASCVD event remains lower than
the number needed to cause harm (bleeding).
• Some patients, in discussion with their
clinician, may feel that the benefit of
prophylactic aspirin is comparable to the
risk and may instead choose to focus on
optimal control of other modifiable ASCVD
risk factors.
Consider risk enhancing factors ± coronary artery
score, where available, as part of the risk:benefit
analysis.
Prophylactic aspirin is not typically recommended
for:
• Adults age >70 years due to a potential risk of
harm, including increased risk of bleeding
• Those age <40 years; there is insufficient
evidence to judge the risk:benefit ratio of
routine aspirin for the primary prevention of
ASCVD in this age group
Reduction of CVD risk
Reassess the appropriateness of treatment at
regular intervals, in case known risk factors for
increased bleeding develop which may alter the
risk:benefit assessment.
Consider treatment discontinuation at age 70 years;
prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults
age >70 years is potentially harmful, and is not
recommended on a routine basis.

Peripheral arterial disease Management
Secondary prevention
Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality
and morbidity, and it is crucial to modify their cardiovascular risk factors. All patients should have aggressive
risk factor modification, regardless of their symptoms.[2] This should include: control of blood pressure;
guideline-directed management for patients with diabetes; lipid-lowering therapy; cessation of smoking;
dietary advice to reduce cardiovascular disease risk and control weight; and increased exercise.[1] [2]
 Additionally, the presence of specific comorbidities and risk factors increases the risk for major adverse
cardiovascular events and major adverse limb events in those with PAD. Multisociety US guidelines
recommend that patients with PAD should be assessed for these risk amplifiers when developing patient-
focused treatment recommendations.[2] These risk amplifiers include (in addition to hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes) chronic kidney disease, depression, atherosclerotic disease in more than one
vascular bed, microvascular disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy), and older age and geriatric
syndromes (frailty, mobility impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition). Coordination of care across multispeciality
teams is important for management of these patients. 
Most patients with established peripheral arterial disease will benefit from preventive antiplatelet therapy.
Although studies have investigated multiple agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel, other antiplatelet agents, and
low-dose anticoagulants [rivaroxaban]) alone and in combination, optimal therapy across the spectrum of
disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic, pre- or post-intervention) remains uncertain.[108] [110]
Patient discussions
Patients should be educated regarding the importance of smoking cessation, blood pressure control,
diabetes control, and cholesterol control. Patients with diabetes should also have a thorough foot care
education.
Advice about avoiding the cold and avoiding vasoconstrictive medications (e.g., pseudoephedrine) should
also be given.

Peripheral arterial disease Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
For those patients who have peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who are not functionally limited, an
annual follow-up visit to monitor for development of coronary, cerebrovascular, and extremity disease
is warranted. For patients with PAD with lifestyle-limiting claudication who benefited from conservative
treatment, annual visits are recommended.
For those who required revascularization either for claudication or limb ischemia, careful surveillance is
required.[2] Long-term patency of aortoiliac and infrainguinal endovascular revascularization should be
monitored routinely with follow-up careful history and physical exam, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and a
duplex ultrasound at regular intervals. The recommendations have been for a follow-up visit immediately
in the postendovascular period; at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively; and annually thereafter.
The intervals of follow-up have varied between different groups.
For infrainguinal vein bypass grafts, patients should have a routine follow-up with careful history and
physical exam, ABI, and duplex.[2] [3] The surveillance should begin immediately post operation and at
regular intervals for 2 years. For femoral-popliteal and femoral-tibial venous conduit bypass, the American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12, and
24 months. Patients should have annual follow-up visits thereafter.
For infrainguinal prosthetic grafts, similar surveillance applies.[2] Patients should have a routine follow-up
with careful history and physical exam, ABI, and duplex. The surveillance should begin immediately post
operation; at regular intervals of 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; and annually thereafter.
Restenosis after revascularization is a pervasive issue. Restenosis is a manifestation of the reparative
response to vessel injury and is characterized by smooth muscle cell proliferation, migration of synthetic
smooth-muscle cells to the luminal surface and deposition of extracellular matrix (intimal hyperplasia).
Stents were traditionally used to bail out a complicated angioplasty (e.g., in cases of acute thrombosis,
flow-limiting dissection, or significant residual stenosis >30%). Increasingly, however, stents are used as
primary implants to inhibit positive vessel wall remodeling and prolong target lesion patency rates. Stents,
however, also suffer from neointimal hyperplasia, so identifying those patients with restenosis requiring
target lesion revascularization is of particular importance. Recurrent symptoms of claudication usually
precede the onset of limb- or life-threatening events in patients with lower-extremity arterial disease, and it
is the recurrence of these symptoms that typically drives patient assessment.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
leg/foot ulcers long term medium
Treatment can be difficult. Therefore, it is important to instigate appropriate treatment promptly.
gangrene long term low
This occurs in nonviable limb. Therefore, it is important to act quickly on critical and acute limb ischemia.
permanent limb weakness/numbness long term low
This occurs in nonviable limb. Therefore, it is important to act quickly on critical and acute limb ischemia.
permanent limb pain long term low
This occurs in nonviable limb. Therefore, it is important to act quickly on critical and acute limb ischemia.
Prognosis
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is related to morbidity and mortality from other types of atherosclerotic
disease, even after adjustment for known common risk factors.[19] This explains the importance of general
cardiovascular prevention in patients with PAD.[2] 
Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a marker for cardiovascular events beyond the diagnosis of PAD.[1] A more
rapid deterioration in ABI carries a worse prognosis for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease
mortality, independent of baseline ABI and potential confounding variables.[19] Presence of hypertension
has been associated with a longitudinal decline in ABI.[2]
Claudication
For the most part, claudication symptoms remain stable and do not worsen rapidly. Two clinical risk factors,
significantly reduced ABI and diabetes, increase the risk for chronic limb ischemia.[2]
Critical limb ischemia
At 1 year, 25% of patients with critical limb ischemia will have died, and 30% will have undergone
amputation. At 5 years, more than 60% of patients with critical limb ischemia will have died.[109]
Acute limb ischemia
The long-term prognosis for the limb is dependent on speed and completeness of revascularization prior to
onset of permanent tissue and nerve damage.
Impact of common comorbidities
The presence of specific comorbidities and risk factors increases the risk for major adverse cardiovascular
events and major adverse limb events in those with PAD. Multisociety US guidelines recommend that

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
