Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Overview
Summary
Interatrial communications (shunts between the atrial chambers) are often referred to as atrial septal defects
(ASDs), although only secundum and vestibular defects are true defects within the atrial septum.
Other atrial level shunts that result in similar physiologic effects are sinus venosus defects, ostium primum
defects, and unroofed coronary sinus defects.
Corrective closure is recommended if Qp:Qs (ratio of pulmonary blood flow to systemic blood flow) is ≥1.5.
Sinus venosus defect with partial anomalous pulmonary drainage and unroofed coronary sinus (especially if
associated with a persistent left superior vena cava) should be corrected irrespective of shunt volume.
Correction is usually performed between ages 2 to 4 years, but can be done in younger patients if
hemodynamically not well tolerated.
Percutaneous device closure is the preferred treatment for secundum defects.
Surgical closure is indicated for large defects, defects with missing rims that prevent secure placement of a
catheter device, or if associated lesions need corrective surgery simultaneously.
Pulmonary hypertension can develop, leading to shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome). Patients need
detailed preoperative assessment to confirm that pulmonary vascular resistance is responsive to medical
management. If pulmonary vascular resistance remains high, corrective closure may not be tolerated.
Definition
An interatrial communication is a congenital cardiac defect that occurs as the result of incomplete separation
between the left and right atrium.
There are five types of interatrial communication: secundum, ostium primum, sinus venosus, coronary sinus,
and vestibular.
Only secundum and vestibular defects are located in the true atrial septum and are, therefore, ASDs. Primum
defects, sinus venosus defects, and coronary sinus defects have historically been classed as ASDs due to
the left-to-right shunt they produce; however, they are more precisely described as interatrial communications
as they are not located in the true septum.[1] [2]

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Interatrial communications occur in 1 to 2 per 1000 live births.[11] [12]  Secundum defects account for 80%
of interatrial communications and have a 2:1 female-to-male predominance.[13] [14] [15] The other types of
interatrial communications occur far less frequently: ostium primum (15%), sinus venosus (5%), and unroofed
coronary sinus defects (1%).[13] The prevalence of vestibular atrial septal defects (ASDs) is not known,
although one retrospective review found that 3% of necropsy specimens had vestibular ASDs; increased
awareness of the location of vestibular ASDs will provide more accurate data in future.[7]
Interatrial communications can also occur in conjunction with other congenital heart defects.
Etiology
Most interatrial communications occur sporadically with no family history of congenital heart defects. Familial
traits have been reported, caused by mutations in the transcription factors NKX2.5 and TBX5, as well as
the structural protein MYH6.[16] [17] [18] Associations with genetic syndromes (e.g., trisomy 21, Holt-Oram
syndrome, Noonan syndrome) are well documented. Girls are more likely than boys to develop interatrial
communications. Maternal alcohol consumption increases the risk of developing a range of congenital heart
conditions, including interatrial communications.[19]
Pathophysiology
Interatrial blood flow is maintained throughout cardiac embryogenesis while two different septal structures
form. The first septum to develop is the septum primum. Programmed cell death in the anterosuperior aspect
of the septum primum results in an ostium secundum. The septum secundum then develops to the right of
the septum primum as an infolding of the atrial wall forming the limbus of the fossa ovalis.[20] The septum
secundum covers the ostium secundum, which results in a valve mechanism allowing only for right-left
shunting. The septum primum forms the floor of the fossa ovalis. An abnormality during the development of
these structures can result in an interatrial communication.
Secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) develop due to a mismatch of septum secundum and ostium
secundum. Ostium primum defects are endocardial cushion defects preventing adequate fusion with the
septum primum. Superior sinus venosus defects have been attributed to the persistence of fetal systemic to
pulmonary veno-venous bridges.[21] They are associated with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage of
right upper pulmonary veins. Inferior sinus venosus defects can develop between the inferior vena cava and
the right atrium.
The direction of blood flow through the defect is related to the relative compliances of the ventricles. In
infancy, the right ventricle is relatively thick and noncompliant; therefore, the amount of left-to-right shunt
is minimal. However, as the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, the right ventricle becomes more
compliant, increasing the left-to-right shunt. With age, the left-to-right shunt is exacerbated by increasing
stiffness of the left ventricle associated with aging and systemic hypertension.
The right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary arteries may enlarge due to the increased volume load. The
pulmonary and tricuspid valves may become incompetent due to enlargement of the valve's annuli. Despite
the increased volume load, the pulmonary artery pressures usually are only slightly increased. However, the
chronic volume overload can cause engorgement of the pulmonary arteries, capillaries, and veins. Some

patients develop medial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease.
Patients become cyanotic if the shunt reverses.
Classification
Classification according to location
Interatrial communications are classified according to their location and the proposed embryogenesis.[2] The
true atrial septum comprises the fossa ovalis and a muscular antero-inferior rim. Therefore, only secundum
and vestibular ASDs are located in the true atrial septum. Primum defects, sinus venosus defects, and
unroofed coronary sinus defects have historically been classed as ASDs due to the left-to-right shunt they
produce. However, they are more precisely described as interatrial communications.  
• Secundum ASDs are found in the region of the fossa ovalis.
• Ostium primum defects are found anterior to the fossa ovalis and superior to the atrioventricular
valves. These defects are a type of endocardial cushion defect (similar to complete atrioventricular
septal defects) and are associated with a cleft in the anterior leaflet of the left atrioventricular valve.
Morphologically, this is better described as a “zone of apposition” of the left atrioventricular valve of the
atrioventricular septal defect, and distinctly different from a true cleft in the anterior leaflet of the mitral
valve.[3] [4]
• Sinus venosus defects usually occur superior and posterior to the fossa ovalis, with an intact limbus
separating the defect from the fossa. They are associated with anomalous connection of the right
pulmonary veins, especially the right superior and middle pulmonary veins. The caval vein (superior or
inferior) can override the defect, although the defect may make it difficult to interpret true association to
one side or the other.[5] [6]
• Unroofed coronary sinus defects are found near the orifice of the coronary sinus and are associated
with a persistent left superior vena cava draining to the left atrium. Various forms of unroofing have
been described.
• Vestibular defects are found in the muscular antero-inferior rim of the fossa ovalis.[7]

Classification by size
The most clinically useful measure of size is the magnitude of the shunt produced by an interatrial
communication. This is commonly described as the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs ratio).
However, symptoms, clinical signs, and evidence of right heart enlargement are frequently driving clinical
decisions.
Case history
Case history #1
A 6-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician for routine well-child care. She is doing well and has never
experienced chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. She actively participates in a dance class and reports
being able to keep up with her peers. There is no family history of congenital heart defects. She is well-
appearing with no apparent distress. Her left ventricular impulse is normal, and there is a subtle right
ventricular lift. Her second heart sound is widely split and does not vary with respiration. She has a
soft 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard along the left upper sternal border. The remainder of her
physical exam is normal.

Case history #2
A 45-year-old woman seeks treatment for frequent palpitations. The patient did well throughout the first
2 decades of life. In her mid-20s she noticed that she became slightly short of breath with exertion. She
has recently been seen twice in the emergency department for atrial tachyarrhythmias. Her left ventricular
impulse is normal. Her right ventricular impulse is 2+. She has a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at her left
upper sternal border. The murmur radiates to her back. The remainder of her physical exam is normal.
Other presentations
The clinical presentation depends on the age of the patient and the size of the left-to-right shunt. Children
can be completely asymptomatic. Occasionally, patients with interatrial communications have symptoms
of heart failure and poor growth in infancy, particularly those born prematurely. This presentation is
more common if the patient has an additional source of pulmonary blood flow, such as a patent ductus
arteriosus, or in association with partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.
Adult patients with an untreated interatrial communication can commonly present with heart failure, atrial
arrhythmias, right ventricular failure, paradoxic embolization, cerebral abscess, or pulmonary vascular
obstructive disease. Adults typically do not develop heart failure until their fifth decade of life. Patients with
sinus venosus-type defects are more prone to developing heart failure. The incidence of atrial arrhythmias
increases with age, especially between the fifth and seventh decades of life.[8]
Pulmonary vascular obstructive disease develops in 5% to 10% of patients and is more common in
women.[9] The clinical manifestations of pulmonary hypertension are often nonspecific, most commonly
including dyspnoea; syncope is uncommon. Examination may include a loud split second heart
sound and tricuspid regurgitation murmur.[10] Some patients develop irreversible right-to-left shunting
(Eisenmenger physiology). Most women with interatrial communications usually tolerate pregnancy
well, including those with a sizable left-to-right shunt. However, patients who have developed pulmonary
vascular obstructive disease do not tolerate pregnancy well. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
may coexist with atrial septal defect. Pulmonary vein stenosis should be ruled out in the setting of
associated pulmonary hypertension.

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Clinical history and presentation can vary significantly depending on the age of the patient and the size of the
defect. Patients are usually asymptomatic and are evaluated for an interatrial communication because of a
heart murmur, or an abnormal ECG or chest x-ray ordered for other clinical reasons.
History
Depending on the degree of shunting, a child may experience dyspnea, fatigue, failure to thrive, or
recurrent lower respiratory infections.
Occasionally, infants may have symptoms of heart failure. If the interatrial communication occurs in
combination with other defects associated with a left-to-right shunt, such as a patent ductus arteriosus or
a ventricular septal defect, the defect is often found much earlier due to a higher incidence of heart failure.
Adults may be asymptomatic, but frequently develop symptoms beyond their fourth decade of life
including palpitations or dizziness due to atrial arrhythmias, fatigue, dyspnea, shortness of breath,
or exercise intolerance.[23] Pregnancy may precipitate atrial arrhythmias in women with interatrial
communications.
Physical exam
The physical findings of an interatrial communication are related to the size of the shunt. Patients may
have a hyperdynamic right ventricular impulse by palpation, especially in older children and adults with a
large left-to-right shunt. The first heart sound is usually normal, but the second heart sound is often split
and does not become single with expiration (fixed split). Patients usually have a systolic ejection murmur
best heard at the left upper sternal border and radiating to the back. This murmur is caused by the excess
volume of blood crossing the pulmonary valve (functional pulmonary valve stenosis). With moderate or
larger defects, an additional mid-diastolic murmur may be appreciated along the lower sternal border due
to the volume of blood crossing the tricuspid valve. A murmur of left atrioventricular valve insufficiency is
often heard in patients with an ostium primum defect.
When pulmonary hypertension has developed, the volume of the left-to-right shunt decreases and results
in loss of fixed splitting of the second heart sound, increased intensity of the pulmonary component of the
second heart sound, shortening of the systolic murmur, and disappearance of the diastolic murmur. If the
shunt reverses, the patient will appear cyanosed and may develop finger clubbing.
Initial tests
Echocardiography
• Echocardiography is the preferred imaging modality. Secundum atrial septal defects can often
be diagnosed using transthoracic echocardiography, especially in children. Transesophageal
echocardiography is used to help assess the size of the defect, to determine the adequacy of
tissue rims for device closure in secundum defects, to diagnose sinus venosus-type defects,
and to ensure normally connected pulmonary veins. Transesophageal echocardiography is
often necessary in older patients if the transthoracic image quality is poor. Two-dimensional
echocardiography demonstrates right atrial and ventricular enlargement as well as the defect itself,
especially for secundum defects.

Interatrial communications are best seen in subcostal views due to the septum being orthogonal to
the ultrasound beam. Secundum defects result in dropout of the mid portion of the atrial septum,
and primum defects result in dropout of the inferior portion, in a four-chamber view from the apex.

Superior sinus venosus defects are defined by an interatrial communication in the posterosuperior
portion of the atrium, with the superior caval vein at times overriding the defect. Coronary sinus
defects have a communication at the orifice of the coronary sinus.
• Doppler exam is used to characterize the shunt volume and to determine the flow pattern through
the defect. Noninvasive calculation of the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow, Qp:Qs, can be
done with Doppler echocardiography but is no longer used stringently to make clinical decisions.
Contrast echocardiography may be used to help determine the presence of a right-to-left shunt
(e.g., if a sinus venosus defect cannot be visualized directly).
Chest x-ray
• Chest x-ray is not needed to diagnose interatrial communications. It may be normal if there is only
a small left-to-right shunt. With larger shunt volumes, the heart may be enlarged and pulmonary
vascular markings may be increased. Chest x-ray cannot differentiate between different types of
interatrial communications.
ECG
• An ECG is not needed to diagnose interatrial communications. It is often normal in secundum,
coronary sinus, and sinus venosus-type interatrial communications if the shunt is small. If the
shunt is moderate to severe, there may be P waves taller than 2.5 mm, suggesting right atrial
enlargement, or R-wave voltages in lead V1 greater than the upper limit of normal for age,
suggesting right ventricular hypertrophy. A notch near the apex of the R wave in the inferior limb
leads, known as the crochetage pattern, is also found in patients with interatrial communications.

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Diagnosis
• Some ECG findings are specific for particular defects. Primum-type defects frequently produce a
counterclockwise frontal-plane loop and left-axis deviation indicating the morphological substrate of
a common atrioventricular junction. Sinus venosus defects are associated with a P-wave axis less
than 30°.[24]
Subsequent tests
Pulse oximetry
• Not diagnostic, but helpful in determining the extent of systemic arterial desaturation because
of right-to-left shunting. Desaturation may occur in older patients as a consequence of elevated
pulmonary vascular resistance or in patients with left superior vena cava draining directly to the left
atrium in unroofed coronary sinus defects.
Chest computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
• The ability to view structures simultaneously in all 3 dimensions makes CT/MRI valuable in
delineating complex congenital heart disease, particularly in patients with limited acoustic
windows.[10] Both CT and MR angiography help delineate extracardiac lesions that are not,
or inadequately, shown on echocardiography. They may be needed in patients with interatrial
communications to help define pulmonary venous anatomy if all pulmonary veins cannot be shown
by echocardiography.[10]
• Hemodynamic data, direction of intracardiac shunting, and degree of shunting, can be calculated
from MRI phase-contrast imaging. In addition, physiological sequelae, including pulmonary artery
dilation and pulmonary vascular pruning, can be identified.[10]
Cardiac catheterization
• Cardiac catheterization is not required for diagnosis. However, it is important in the evaluation of
pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with suspected pulmonary vascular obstructive disease;
it is considered the gold standard for measuring hemodynamics in patients with congenital heart
disease and advanced pulmonary vascular disease, especially to assess operability.[10]
• If patients develop a right-to-left shunt, reversibility of the shunt with pulmonary vasodilators should
be assessed to guide therapy. If the right-to-left shunt is reversible with pulmonary vasodilators, the
interatrial communication can be surgically closed. However, if the right-to-left shunt is irreversible,
surgery is not an option.
• When available, inhaled nitric oxide, alone or in combination with oxygen, is considered the
preferred agent for vasodilator testing. It is safe and short acting and offers a better pulmonary
vasodilator effect than systemic agents. However, nitric oxide is not always affordable and thus is
not readily available in all cardiac catheterization laboratories, particularly in low- to middle-income
countries. Alternative vasodilator agents include epoprostenol, adenosine, iloprost, treprostinil,
milrinone, and nitroglycerin.[10]

dyspnea, and edema.
• Rare in infants; the main presenting symptom is tachypnea.
faltering growth (uncommon)
• Infants with interatrial communications may present with faltering growth.
• Congenital heart disease should always be excluded in infants and children with unexplained faltering
growth.
symptoms of atrial arrhythmias (uncommon)

interatrial communications to help define pulmonary venous anatomy
if all pulmonary veins cannot be shown by transthoracic or trans-
esophageal echocardiography.[10]
• Hemodynamic data, direction of intracardiac shunting, and degree
of shunting, can be calculated from MRI phase-contrast imaging. In
addition, physiologic sequelae, including pulmonary artery dilation
and pulmonary vascular pruning, can be identified.[10]

• Not required for diagnosis, but is used to detect pulmonary vascular
resistance in the subset of patients at risk for pulmonary vascular
obstructive disease; it is considered the gold standard for measuring
hemodynamics in patients with congenital heart disease and
advanced pulmonary vascular disease, especially to assess
operability.[10]
• If patients develop a right-to-left shunt, reversibility of the shunt with
pulmonary vasodilators should be assessed to guide therapy. If
the right-to-left shunt is reversible with pulmonary vasodilators, the
interatrial communication can be surgically closed. However, if the
right-to-left shunt is irreversible, surgery is not an option.
• When available, inhaled nitric oxide, alone or in combination
with oxygen, is considered the preferred agent for vasodilator
testing. It is safe and short acting and offers a better pulmonary
vasodilator effect than systemic agents. However, nitric oxide is
not always affordable and thus is not readily available in all cardiac
catheterization laboratories, particularly in low- to middle-income
countries. Alternative vasodilator agents include epoprostenol,
adenosine, iloprost, treprostinil, milrinone, and nitroglycerin.[10]

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Small interatrial communications can close spontaneously. If corrective closure is required, device closure
in the catheterization laboratory or surgical closure can be used depending on the type of interatrial
communication.[29] Minimally invasive surgical repair can be performed through limited sternal and
parasternal incisions, anterolateral thoracotomies, or lateral minithoracotomies.[30]
Interatrial communications should be treated by physicians experienced in the management of congenital
heart disease.[23] [27]
Indications for corrective closure
Young patients with interatrial communications can be observed initially, as small defects may close or
shrink and may not need corrective closure. If the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow, Qp:Qs, is
<1.5, the defect is of little prognostic importance and does not require closure. If the Qp:Qs ratio is or
remains at 1.5 or greater, or there is evidence of right atrial enlargement, the defect requires closure to
prevent heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease.[31] This is usually
performed at age 2 to 4 years. Patients who develop unremitting heart failure require earlier repair.
A key consideration in patients with interatrial communications is the extent of pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR). Corrective closure is not recommended if PVR is ≥5 Wood units (WU). Instead,
pulmonary vasodilator therapy should be initiated in an attempt to lower PVR.[23] [27] If pulmonary
vasodilator treatment lowers PVR to <5 WU, corrective closure may be considered. If the patient is not
responding and PVR remains ≥5 WU, corrective closure should generally not be performed.[23] Note that
in some patients with a left-to-right shunt and a PVR ≥5WU, corrective closure or partial closure may still
be considered by some clinicians on a case-by-case basis, weighing risks and benefits.
Fixed pulmonary hypertension with shunt reversal as a result of pulmonary overcirculation is also referred
to as Eisenmenger syndrome and is associated with various degrees of desaturation. Patients with
Eisenmenger syndrome should avoid pregnancy, dehydration, and high altitudes. They are at increased
risk of systemic thromboembolism. Endocardial pacing is therefore contraindicated and particular care
must be taken with intravenous injections to avoid air embolism.
Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome frequently develop erythrocytosis to compensate for the hypoxemia,
which can lead to hyperviscosity. Hyperviscosity can produce symptoms of headache, fatigue, and
sometimes mental status changes. Treatment of symptomatic hyperviscosity involves phlebotomy and
intravenous infusion of saline. Routine phlebotomy should be avoided.
Pulmonary vasodilator therapy may be used to improve quality of life. Those demonstrated to be of benefit
include endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g., bosentan), the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors sildenafil
or tadalafil, and, in limited studies, infusions of the prostanoid epoprostenol.[32] Oral therapy is usually
favored to avoid complications associated with intravenous administration in patients with Eisenmenger
syndrome. A pulmonary-to-systemic shunt (reversed Potts shunt) procedure may be considered as a
last resort option for patients with pulmonary hypertension who have undergone surgical correction of
congenital heart disease and are unresponsive to maximal medical therapy. It may improve exercise
capacity and facilitate easier medical management. Heart and lung transplantation, or double lung
transplantation with repair of the cardiac defect, may also be considered in selected patients with severe
disease.[10]

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Management
Options for corrective closure
Treatment involves percutaneous closure or an operation (using either direct sutures or a patch of
autologous pericardium) to close the defect. Device closure is used to treat secundum defects, but cannot
usually be used in other types of interatrial communications due to the closeness of the defects to other
cardiac structures. Surgical closure is indicated for large defects, defects with missing rims that prevent
secure placement of a catheter device, or if associated lesions need corrective surgery simultaneously.
• Ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) or vestibular ASD: device closure is the preferred
method if rims are adequate to secure a device.

 If the rims are inadequate or there are large septal aneurysms or multiple fenestrations of the atrial
septum, surgical closure is required.
• Ostium primum defect: surgical closure with repair of the left atrioventricular valve is the most
commonly used procedure.
• Coronary sinus defect: surgical correction can be performed by simply closing the orifice of the
coronary sinus. However, in the presence of a left superior vena cava, rerouting to the right atrium
is needed to avoid significant systemic arterial desaturation.
• Sinus venosus defect: anomalous right pulmonary veins are baffled via the defect to the left atrium.
A Warden operation may also be performed, whereby the superior vena cava is transected and

then reconnected to the right atrial appendage while a patch is placed to the orifice of the superior
vena cava to route anomalous right pulmonary vein flow across the defect to the left atrium.
Sinus venosus defect with partial anomalous pulmonary drainage and unroofed coronary sinus
(especially if associated with a persistent left superior vena cava) should be corrected irrespective of
shunt volume.
Surgical correction can be performed with minimally invasive strategies through thoracotomies or
ministernotomies, with equivalent results when compared with conventional median sternotomy
procedures.[30]
Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent endocarditis are required for the first 6 months after device or surgical
closure.[23] [27] Patients with unrepaired cyanotic heart disease will also require endocarditis prophylaxis
when undergoing certain interventions.

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Routine follow-up for patients with small interatrial communications that do not require surgical closure
should include assessment of symptoms, especially arrhythmias and paradoxic embolic events in adults.
Pulmonary pressures, right ventricular function, and residual atrial shunting should be assessed by
echocardiography. Patients who have had device closure of a secundum atrial septal defect should be
assessed for symptoms of atrial arrhythmias, chest pain, or embolic events. Echocardiography is usually
performed at 24 hours, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. Further monitoring is elective.[27] Attention should
be paid to device placement, residual shunting, thrombus formation, and pericardial effusion.[27]
Postoperative fever, chest or abdominal pain, vomiting, and fatigue may indicate pericardial effusion or
cardiac tamponade and should be investigated immediately. Chest pain or syncope after device closure
may be due to device erosion and should be investigated immediately.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
device erosion short term low
Presents with chest pain or syncope after device closure.
pericardial effusion/tamponade short term low
Presents after repair of an interatrial communication with postoperative fever, chest or abdominal pain,
vomiting, and fatigue.
paradoxic embolization long term medium
Caused by embolism of a venous thrombus into the systemic arterial circulation through the interatrial
communication. Requires the presence of a right-to-left shunt through the interatrial communication. A
right-to-left shunt can occur intermittently in patients while coughing or during a Valsalva maneuver, or
may be present at rest in patients with Eisenmenger physiology. This complication is usually seen in adults
with an undiagnosed interatrial communication. It may present as a stroke or transient ischemic attack.
Additionally, there can be peripheral emboli.
congestive cardiac failure variable low
Usually does not occur until after the fifth decade of life. In adults, symptoms include fatigue, decreased
exercise tolerance, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema.
Can also occur in infants with interatrial communications; the main presenting symptom in infants is
tachypnea.
infective endocarditis variable low
Can occur as a complication of device closure or surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for the
first 6 months after repair of an interatrial communication.[23] [27] Patients with unrepaired cyanotic heart
disease will also require endocarditis prophylaxis when undergoing certain interventions.
Often presents nonspecifically, and most commonly involves fever with possible physical signs of
peripheral emboli: Osler nodes, Roth spots, or Janeway lesions. A cardiac murmur may sometimes be
noted.
Echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission
tomography (PET)/CT imaging are useful for diagnosis.[33]
atrial fibrillation variable low
Symptoms include rapid palpitations, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Occurs in large defects as a result
of atrial enlargement and hypertrophy. Treatment of interatrial communications may help in controlling
atrial arrhythmias; however, incidence of recurrent arrhythmias is higher with delayed closure of interatrial
communications. Pregnancy can precipitate atrial fibrillation due to the increased volume load. The
incidence of atrial arrhythmias increases with age, especially between the fifth and seventh decades of
life.[8] Atrial arrhythmias should be treated to restore and maintain sinus rhythm if possible.[40]

Interatrial communications (atrial septal defects) Follow up
Prognosis
The prognosis of interatrial communications without pulmonary vascular obstructive disease is excellent. The
surgical mortality of an uncomplicated closure of an interatrial communication is less than 0.5%.[36]
Transcatheter closure of interatrial communications has shown equivalent results compared with surgery, but
a higher long-term reintervention rate.[37] Older age at the time of repair of an interatrial communication is
associated with a higher rate of adverse events.[38] Life expectancy in patients with uncomplicated defects is
equivalent to that of the normal population.
The incidence of device erosion is <1%, and likely <1 in 1000.[39]
Shunt reversal with inoperable Eisenmenger physiology is associated with a poor prognosis, as is persistent
or recurrent pulmonary hypertension after surgical repair.[10]

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
