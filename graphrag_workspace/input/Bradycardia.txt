Bradycardia Overview
Summary
Sinus bradycardia is any heart rhythm slower than 50 bpm, even if transient, owing to sinus node dysfunction
and/or atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities.
Causes include intrinsic sinus node, AV nodal, and His-Purkinje disease, or extrinsic influences, which may
be reversible.
Common symptoms include syncope, fatigue, and dizziness; however, the patient may be asymptomatic.
Evaluation involves determining the association of symptoms with heart rate and an assessment of
underlying cardiovascular conditions. A 12-lead ECG and/or a heart monitor are the diagnostic tests of
choice.
Patients with a reversible cause may not require long-term therapy; however, patients with nonreversible
causes may require an implantable pacemaker with or without a defibrillator. Urgent treatment may include
temporary pacing and drug interventions.
Potentially life-threatening complications, including cardiovascular collapse and death, may occur.
Definition
While some consider bradycardia to be a heart rate <60 bpm, this is in dispute and most consider rates of
<50 bpm to represent bradycardia. A study of 500 healthy people, using ECG recordings, showed the mean
afternoon heart rate to be 70 bpm in men and women, with two standard deviations being 46-93 bpm in men
and 51-95 bpm in women.[1] [2] A slow heart rate is common under various circumstances and does not
necessarily require treatment unless it causes symptoms. Nonetheless, some patients, even if asymptomatic,
may require interventions to prevent life-threatening complications. This topic focuses on electrical causes of
bradycardia.

Bradycardia Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Sinus node dysfunction occurs in 1 in 600 patients per year over the age of 65 years.[12] The incidence
of symptomatic atrioventricular block is probably as common. There are no good epidemiologic data, and
the incidence and prevalence of bradycardia is unknown; however, in clinical practice, it may occur in both
sexes equally and is more common in older people. There are no known data on global differences. The
percentage of patients who require therapy is not completely certain.
Etiology
Bradycardia is due to sinus node dysfunction or conduction system disease, the causes of which may be
intrinsic or extrinsic.
• Intrinsic causes are the result of fibrous changes of the nodal tissue. Intrinsic causes are vast and
include idiopathic degenerative processes (e.g., aging), congenital or genetic abnormalities, valvular
disease, direct tissue damage (e.g., hypoxia, surgical trauma [surgical aortic and tricuspid valve
repair/replacement, transcatheter aortic valve replacement]), tissue inflammation or infiltration (e.g.,
sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis), infections (e.g., typhoid fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis,
toxoplasmosis, rheumatic fever, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease), autoimmune or collagen vascular
diseases (e.g., lupus erythematosus, connective tissue disease), or abnormal autonomic effects. [18]
• Extrinsic causes include exposure to toxins (e.g., lead, black widow spider venom, xylazine poisoning,
or tricyclic antidepressant overdose), drugs (e.g., digoxin, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers,
ivabradine, or class I or III anti-arrhythmic drugs), electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyperkalemia,
acidemia), or environmental insults (e.g., hypothermia).[3] [19] [20] [21] Additionally, situations that
cause high (intense) vagal tone (activation) (increased parasympathetic input to the sinus node) can
result in bradycardia. These include vomiting, coughing, glottis stimulation, micturition, and defecation.
Iatrogenic causes include vagal nerve stimulators. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity and neurocardiogenic
syncope could also lead to bradycardia. Some causes, such as hypothyroidism, electrolyte disorders,
and those that are drug-induced, are reversible. Inferior wall myocardial infarction and increased
intracranial pressure can also cause various types of bradycardia (i.e., Cushing reflex).
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), comprising obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea, and
Cheyne-Stokes breathing, can be associated with various bradycardias.[22] [23] [24] [25] Sinus bradycardia,
second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, vagotonic AV block, or complete heart block have been observed
in some patients only during sleep. In SDB, the prevalence of profound sinus bradycardia is 7% to 40%,
of second- or third-degree AV block is 1% to 13%, and of sinus pauses is 3% to 33%.[25] High vagal tone
in an otherwise healthy young adult is a common cause of sinus bradycardia and Mobitz I (rarely Mobitz
II) AV block. This may even manifest during sleep and may be exacerbated by SBD. It is proposed that
hypoxia in the absence of lung inflation leads to increased vagal stimulation of the carotid body resulting in
bradycardia.[25] Over time, the sustained physiological stresses associated with SDB are thought to interact
with circadian mechanisms to remodel the structure and electrophysiologic function of the heart, increasing
the risk of rhythm disorders.[25] In a small cohort study of patients with severe OSA and 50% prevalence
of episodes of severe nocturnal bradycardia, treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
decreased the median number of bradycardic events recorded by an insertable loop recorder over a 16-
month follow-up period.[25]
Generalized conduction system disease related to calcification and fibrosis is called Lev's disease (or Lev-
Lenegre Syndrome) and is a cause of acquired complete heart block. Lev's disease is seen most commonly
in older people and is often described as senile degeneration of the conduction system.

Bradycardia Theory
Bradyarrhythmias can be seen in adults with congenital heart disease. In fact, arrhythmias are the most
common complication seen in adults living with congenital heart disease. This is due to cardiac conduction
abnormalities, or can also be sequelae of procedural intervention. The most common congenital causes of
sinus node dysfunction are heterotaxy/polysplenia, left juxtaposition of atrial appendages, or surgical repairs.
The most common congenital causes of AV node dysfunction are heterotaxy/polysplenia, congenitally
corrected transposition of great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and tricuspid atresia. The SCN5A gene
has been shown to cause inherited conduction disease. This gene encodes the cardiac sodium channel
alpha subunit. Although this is the most common gene associated with conduction disease, it only accounts
for 5% of cases. Therefore, genetic testing is not routinely performed or recommended.[26] [27]
Of note, pathologic bradycardia during pregnancy is rare and is usually due to congenital heart block.
Normally, physiologic adaptations during pregnancy lead to an increase in cardiac output and resting
heart rate. Heart rate can increase by up to 10-20 bpm, reaching a maximum in the third trimester.[28] [29]
Symptomatic bradycardia has been associated with supine hypotensive syndrome of pregnancy. This is seen
when maternal positional changes cause compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus.[29]
Rarely, bradycardia may be associated with seemingly unrelated clinical conditions. For example,
bradycardia can be rarely associated with epilepsy, and should be considered in patients with unusual
presentations of syncope or in patients with a history suggestive of both epilepsy and syncope. Ictal
bradycardia and ictal asystole predominantly occur in association with focal seizures, with loss of awareness
in people with mainly left lateralized temporal lobe seizures, and are associated with electroencephalogram
signs of brain ischemia during these episodes.[30]
Pathophysiology
The cellular mechanisms are complex and interrelated. Failure of any one of these mechanisms can
have an effect on heart rate. Normal cardiac electrical activation requires normal sinus node automaticity
and effective atrioventricular (AV) node and His-Purkinje conduction. Anything that causes sinus node
automaticity or conduction through the AV node and/or His-Purkinje system can cause bradycardia.
Classification
Clinical classification
Bradycardia is classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients often do not require
treatment. Bradycardia, including sinus bradycardia and Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) atrioventricular (AV)
block, can be completely benign in young, healthy, athletic individuals.
Bradycardia classification
Bradycardia can be classified according to the site of the conduction disturbance.[3]
Sinus node dysfunction
• Sinus bradycardia: heart rate <50 bpm. It can be a normal finding, especially during rest or sleep, or
can be abnormal and symptomatic.[4] It is common in athletes, as they often have high resting vagal
tone.

Bradycardia Theory
THEORY
• Sinus nodal pauses/arrest: episodic, abrupt termination of sinus rhythm generally lasting >3 seconds.
Episodes can last >30 seconds. There can be hemodynamic collapse, acute drop in blood pressure,
and/or loss of consciousness. The term sinus arrest is used generally for long sinus node pauses (i.e.,
>5 seconds). Paroxysmal sinus arrest or bradycardia can be due to intense vagal discharge.[5]
• Sinus nodal exit block: sinus node continues to activate but electrical activation is delayed and blocked
either completely or incompletely between the sinus node and the atria. There can be various levels of
block (e.g., complete or intermittent block).[6]
• Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome: occurs when there are episodic periods of tachycardia (usually
atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or atrial tachycardia), followed by termination of the tachycardia leading to
sinus arrest or long sinus pauses, followed by sinus bradycardia.[7]
• Chronotropic incompetence: a form of bradycardia in which the sinus rate does not accelerate
appropriately with exercise. Although there are no standardized criteria for diagnosing chronotropic
incompetence, it is generally defined as failure to reach 85% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate
(defined as 220 minus the patient's age in years), or the inability to reach 80% of the heart rate reserve
(computed as the change in heart rate from rest to peak exercise divided by the difference of the
resting HR and the age-predicted maximal HR), on a dynamic exercise test.[8]
• Sinus node dysfunction (SND): historically known as sick sinus syndrome; a general term describing
bradycardia presumed to be caused by sinus node disease manifesting as one of the above
abnormalities. There is evidence of slowing of sinus node function. Although this is generally not due
to autonomic abnormalities, they can contribute. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought that
degenerative fibrosis of the cardiac conduction fibers and surrounding atrial myocardium from factors
such as long-standing hypertension, valvular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial arrhythmias,
congestive heart failure, or increasing age contribute. The incidence of SND increases with age. SND
accounts for nearly half of the pacemaker implantations in the United States. Some patients have
marked bradycardia owing to SND only after medications that slow the sinus node are initiated. It has
been associated with atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction abnormalities and a high risk of systemic
embolism.[9] [10] [11][12]
AV conduction disease
AV block occurs when the atrial depolarization fails to reach the ventricles or when atrial depolarization is
conducted with a delay.
• First-degree AV block: delay in AV conduction, such that the PR interval is >0.2 seconds. During first-
degree AV block, there is one-to-one conduction but there is delay in AV nodal conduction.[13] It is not
necessarily associated with bradycardia but it may be associated with higher degrees of AV block and
subsequent bradycardia or sinus node dysfunction.
• Second-degree AV block: periodic failure of conduction from the atria to the ventricles. This assumes
that the atrial rate is regular. A blocked premature atrial beat is not second-degree AV block. There are
different types:
• Mobitz I: grouped beating with a constant PP interval, lengthening in the PR interval, and
changing (usually shortening) RR intervals with the cycle ending with a P-wave and not followed
by a QRS complex. As the PR interval gradually prolongs, the RR interval tends to stay the
same or shorten.[14] This is also called Wenckebach AV block.
• Mobitz II: associated with single nonconducted P-waves with a constant PP interval and
constant PR intervals (no change in the PR >0.025 seconds).[15]

Bradycardia Theory
• 2:1 block: only one PR interval to examine before the blocked P-wave and 2 P-waves for every
QRS complex. In most cases, it will change to Mobitz I or II. If there is an associated bundle
branch block along with a normal PR interval, this suggests block in the His-Purkinje system.
• High-degree AV block: more than one sequentially blocked P-wave.[16]
• Third-degree AV block: occurs when there are no conducted impulses from the atria to the ventricles.
This is also called complete AV block. This may occur with regular atrial activity without conduction or
with an atrial tachyarrhythmia.
• Paroxysmal AV block: normal AV nodal conduction followed by sudden block of AV conduction
associated with a long pause and multiple blocked P-waves, with subsequent resumption of AV
conduction. This can be related to underlying AV nodal or His-Purkinje conduction anomalies or to
abrupt parasympathetic activation causing block in AV nodal conduction. In the latter instance, there is
often slowing in sinus activation.
• Vagotonic AV block: slowing of the sinus node with prolongation of the PR interval followed by AV
block owing to transient abrupt increase in parasympathetic tone.
• Congenital complete heart block: usually associated with a narrow QRS complex escape rhythm
arising in the AV node.
Escape rhythms
When the sinus rate slows or there is AV block, other cardiac structures can activate owing to their intrinsic
automaticity. The AV nodal rate tends to be 40 to 60 bpm and the ventricular rate tends to be 20-40 bpm.
• Ectopic atrial rhythm: originates from atrial structures other than the sinus node during sinus
bradycardia or sinus arrest.
• Junctional rhythm: escape rhythm when there is bradycardia or arrest of sinus node or atrial activation.
Activation of the junction may occur with or without AV block.[17]
• Ventricular rhythm: an escape rhythm from the ventricles when there is AV block or sinus bradycardia.
Atrioventricular dissociation
• Atrial and ventricular activation occur from different pacemakers. Ventricular activation may be from
junctional or infranodal automaticity. AV dissociation can occur in the presence of intact AV conduction,
especially when rates of the pacemaker, either junctional or ventricular, exceed the atrial rate.
• The atria and ventricles do not activate in a synchronous fashion but beat independent of each other.
Usually, the ventricular rate is the same as or faster than the atrial rate. When the atrial rate is faster
and the atria and ventricles are beating independently, complete heart block is present.
• AV dissociation can be complete or incomplete. When incomplete, some P-waves conduct and capture
the ventricles but, if they do not, it is complete. Complete AV dissociation mimics AV block and has to
do with P-wave timing in relation to independent ventricular activation.
• There are two types:
• Isorhythmic: when the atrial rate is the same (or nearly the same) as the ventricular rate but the
P-wave is not conducted
• Interference: when P-waves and QRS rates are similar but, occasionally, the atria conduct to the
ventricles.

Case history
Case history #1
An 85-year-old man presents with fatigue and episodes during which he feels he is going to pass out. He
has no known heart disease. His ECG shows sinus bradycardia with a rate of 30 bpm and on a rhythm
strip he has up to 5-second pauses.
Case history #2
A 55-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes presents at the emergency department with complaints
of dizziness and lightheadedness on exertion that has occurred gradually over the past month. He takes
metoprolol (a beta-blocker) for hypertension. He is hypotensive and has a heart rate of 45 bpm. The
rhythm strip shows Mobitz type II atrioventricular (AV) block with Q waves in the inferior leads. There are
no previous ECGs.
Other presentations
Other diagnostic features include exercise intolerance and chest pain. Atypical presentations include elite
athletes who present with sinus bradycardia, Mobitz I, or even Mobitz II atrioventricular (AV) block without
symptoms owing to a conditioned heart. The condition could also manifest shortly after taking a beta-
blocker, a calcium-channel blocker, or digoxin in a patient with conduction system disease. Adolescents
may not have any symptoms owing to preserved left-ventricular function; by contrast, older people are
more likely to manifest symptoms because of structural heart disease. Additionally, sinus bradycardia or
AV nodal dysfunction could be noted incidentally on inpatient telemetry or at home using smartphone or
watch sleep monitoring applications, and should prompt investigation for sleep-disordered breathing.

Bradycardia Diagnosis
Approach
A diagnosis of bradycardia is generally made on an ECG or telemetry monitor when there is slowing of the
heart rhythm to <50 bpm, even if only transient. Some consider bradycardia to be a heart rate <60 bpm,
but this is in dispute and most consider rates of <50 bpm to represent bradycardia. Bradycardia can also be
detected during home blood pressure monitoring using electronic blood pressure monitors, smartphone heart
rhythm monitoring applications, and wearable devices that incorporate heart rhythm detection technology.
The challenge is determining the etiology of the bradycardia and determining the site at which there is
reduction in either impulse generation or propagation. The primary use of testing is to correlate symptoms
with bradycardia and/or to establish a potentially dangerous condition as the cause of bradycardia, even
though the patient may be asymptomatic.
History
The most important diagnostic factor is age. Older patients present frequently with bradycardia owing to
disease in the sinus node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, or the His-Purkinje system. In the AV conduction
system, age-related fibrosis and sclerosis (Lev-Lenegre Syndrome) account for AV block in almost half
of the cases. Older patients in particular may also present with bradycardia associated with medications
that have AV-node-blocking properties, such as beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and digoxin;
therefore, a detailed drug history should be taken in every patient with bradycardia. Additionally, diuretics
may lead to electrolyte disorders, which can cause bradycardia if severe.
History should focus on the timing, severity, frequency, duration, and chronicity of symptoms. Additionally,
clinicians should ask about aggravating or alleviating factors, relationship to exercise or exertion,
nocturnal symptoms, temporal relationship to medications, postural changes, emotional distress, or
maneuvers that increase vagal tone such as coughing, defecation, vomiting, or wearing tight collars.
Clinicians should inquire about daytime sleepiness, memory difficulties, or night-time snoring when
thinking about sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) as a potential cause.[11]
A thorough travel history should be obtained to evaluate for any exposures to infections that can lead to
bradycardia or myocarditis. For example,  Trypanosoma cruzi  is a parasite endemic to South and Latin
America, and infection can lead to Chagas disease, which may cause myopericarditis. Additionally, Lyme
disease is prevalent in Northeastern US, and can lead to AV nodal conduction delays.
A family or personal history of infiltrative diseases, autoimmune disease, congenital cardiac disease, or
cardiovascular disease is also important to ask about.
A complete review of systems should focus on rashes (e.g., erythema migrans in Lyme disease), tick
or insect bites, headaches (suggesting increased intracranial pressure), daytime fatigue or snoring
evaluating for SDB, exposures to toxins, history of recent or cardiac surgeries/heart transplant, chest pain,
or crescendo angina, which may be concerning for myocardial infarction.
Sinus bradycardia is often noted in patients with significant hypothyroidism, whether or not they have
other symptoms of the disease. Asymptomatic or symptomatic sinus bradycardia may occur in association
with hypothermia.
One of the most common symptoms associated with bradycardia is dizziness or lightheadedness. Many
patients also complain of worsening fatigue. Syncope is possible with long pauses or slow heart rates,
especially in patients with complete heart block and a slow ventricular escape rhythm with left ventricular
dysfunction or in patients with second-degree AV block. These symptoms generally occur owing to

Bradycardia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
bradycardia-induced cerebral hypoperfusion, especially in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction.
Exercise intolerance and shortness of breath is also common and may be due to sinus node, AV node,
or His-Purkinje system disease. Chest pain is a rare presentation. Bradycardia can be asymptomatic and
benign, especially in younger individuals and in trained athletes.
Physical exam
The physical exam is usually nonspecific. Palpation of peripheral pulse or cardiac auscultation may reveal
a slow, regular heart beat <50 bpm or an irregular pulse of varying intensity. Bradycardia by pulse may
not necessarily be bradycardia by auscultation or ECG as ventricular bigeminy can present with a slow
pulse but not actually represent bradycardia. Occasionally, this and other rhythm disturbances can cause
a “pulse deficit” in which a slow pulse mimics a slow heartbeat (i.e., bradycardia).
Patients with bradycardia secondary to complete heart block can have intermittent cannon a-waves in
their jugular venous pulse (JVP) owing to atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. Similarly,
there may be a variable S1 during complete AV block. During a junctional or ventricular rhythm with 1:1 V-
to-A conduction, there may be cannon a-waves.
Because bradycardia can contribute to heart failure, patients may have a third heart sound, rales, jugular
venous distension, and abdominal and lower extremity edema. Signs of hypothyroidism should be
assessed (e.g., dry or coarse skin or hair, facial edema). Poor cardiac output due to bradycardia may be
manifest as hypotension, mental status changes, and/or pallor; the extremities may be cool to the touch.
Orthostatic vital sign measurements may help diagnose underlying autonomic dysfunction.
ECG
A 12-lead ECG is the first test in the diagnosis of bradycardia, regardless of the suspected cause. It
is simple and easy to perform and provides diagnostic information. ECG also offers important clues
regarding underlying conditions that could have caused the bradycardia; however, it only gives a snapshot
in time that may not be helpful for diagnosis if bradycardia or symptoms are intermittent. In this situation,
ambulatory monitoring is needed to correlate symptoms to bradycardia.
Sinus node dysfunction
• Sinus bradycardia: regular P-wave followed by QRS at a rate of <50 bpm; ambulatory ECG
monitoring is helpful to correlate symptoms with heart rate.[41]
• Sinus nodal pauses or arrest: long RR cycle length, which is longer than the RR interval of the
underlying sinus rhythm.

node or the His-Purkinje system, as is the case with 2:1 AV block.
• Third-degree AV block: occurs when there are no conducted impulses from the atria to the
ventricles. There is no consistent PR relationship. It may occur with ventricular or junctional escape
rhythm.

associated with a long pause and multiple blocked P-waves, with subsequent resumption of AV
conduction. This may begin with an ectopic impulse.

Bradycardia Diagnosis
• Vagotonic AV block: slowing of the sinus node with prolongation of the PR interval followed by AV
block owing to transient abrupt increase in parasympathetic tone.
• Congenital complete heart block: usually associated with a narrow QRS complex escape rhythm
arising in the AV node.
• Escape rhythms may also occur in AV block, such as atrial (abnormal P-wave and decreased PR
interval), junctional (above the bundle of His, produces a rate of approximately 40-60 bpm and
narrow QRS complexes), and ventricular rhythms (below the bundle of His, produces a slower rate
of 20-40 bpm and wide QRS complexes).

Atrioventricular dissociation
Independent activation of the atria and ventricles results in no fixed relationship between the P-waves and
the QRS complexes. The PR intervals are variable in a random fashion. Ventricular rate is the same as or
faster than the atrial rate. There are 2 types:
• Isorhythmic: when the atrial rate is the same (or nearly the same) as the ventricular rate but the P-
wave is not conducted
• Interference: when P-waves and QRS rates are similar but, occasionally, the atria conduct to the
ventricles.

Laboratory investigations
There are no specific laboratory investigations used to diagnose bradycardia; however, initial workup
should include thyroid function tests and a complete metabolic panel to rule out electrolyte disturbances,
particularly hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and hypocalcemia.[41] Cardiac enzymes
should be obtained if bradycardia is associated with ECG changes suggestive of myocardial infarction
or ischemia. Patients who have junctional bradycardia and who are prescribed digoxin should have
their serum digoxin level checked. Patients with chronic bradycardia may have evidence of worsening
renal function. Any additional laboratory testing should be guided by information obtained by history and
physical examination to aid identification of the underlying cause.
Other initial investigations
Holter or event monitoring, exercise testing, carotid sinus massage, and echocardiogram all form part of
the initial workup in addition to the ECG and are especially useful for intermittent bradycardia or patients
with symptoms. If patients have sinus bradycardia, they should be further evaluated only if they are
symptomatic or show evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
Holter monitoring
• Enables correlation of symptoms with episodes of bradycardia.[41] Diagnostic clues are obtained
in 50% to 70% of patients with bradycardia suspected on clinical grounds.[42] [43] However, events
can be missed if symptoms do not occur in the 24- to 48-hour monitoring period.
• Asymptomatic bradycardia and pauses (especially nocturnal) are not uncommon in the normal
heart and are probably nondiagnostic.
• Shows sinus pauses, sinus arrest, second- or third-degree AV block, or severe sinus bradycardia
with symptoms. First-degree AV block or Mobitz type I AV block may be noted while patients are
asleep owing to high vagal tone.
• May be used if severe sinus node dysfunction (e.g., sinus exit block, sinus pauses, sinus arrest, or
tachy-brady syndrome) is suspected but cannot be documented.
• May help distinguish the location of the block (i.e., AV node versus His-Purkinje system) in 2:1
and high-degree AV block. A long-monitored strip should be run because 2:1 AV block is unlikely
to persist. The other forms of AV block (Mobitz I or II) should then become apparent. Monitoring
while the patient does some form of exertion (e.g., arm exercise, standing, and walking) may also
help to demonstrate the level of block. Block at the level of the AV node should improve with the

adrenergic stimulation, but block below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system may worsen as AV
nodal conduction improves and increases the frequency of inputs to the His-Purkinje system.
Event monitoring/mobile cardiac telemetry
• Widely used in the diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia and can be worn for up to 30 days.
• Earlier designs were patient-triggered and so relied on the patient being able to recognize his
or her symptoms and activate the monitor in a timely manner. This issue has been corrected by
newer-generation monitors with auto-triggering capability.
• Smartphone event monitors convert cardiac electric signal to an ultrasound FM sound signal, which
is then demodulated to a digital ECG tracing. The ECG is generated in real time and can also be
stored and instantaneously transmitted to a secure server for further analysis.
• Photoplethysmographic-based smart devices (e.g., watches) may also be used.
• Shows sinus pauses, sinus arrest, second- or third-degree AV block, or severe sinus bradycardia
with symptoms. May be used if severe sinus node dysfunction (e.g., sinus exit block, sinus pauses,
sinus arrest, or tachy-brady syndrome) is suspected but cannot be documented. Particularly useful
in diagnosing Mobitz I AV block.
Exercise testing
• A subnormal increase in heart rate after exercise (chronotropic incompetence) can be useful in
diagnosing sinus node dysfunction.[42] [44] However, sensitivity and specificity are unclear and
the results obtained may not be reproducible.[45] Even so, exercise-induced AV block, even if
asymptomatic, can be significant and suggests disease of the His-Purkinje system.
• Identifying symptoms owing to sinus bradycardia can be difficult; however, exercise testing can be
useful to help determine sinus node dysfunction as the cause of symptoms.
• Useful in determining level of block in second-degree AV block.
• Useful for exercise-induced symptoms where AV block is suspected.
Carotid sinus massage
• Performed during continuous ECG monitoring (after evaluating for the presence of carotid bruit by
direct auscultation) in the evaluation of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, which causes symptomatic
bradycardia and is associated with sinus node dysfunction.[41]
• Diagnostic yield of carotid sinus massage can be increased by performing this during head-up
tilting.[46]
• A pause of >3 seconds with symptoms is indicative of a cardio-inhibitory response from carotid
sinus hypersensitivity.
• Can help diagnose Mobitz I and II AV block; it will accentuate Wenckebach in the AV node but will
have an opposite effect if the block is below the His bundle.
• May help distinguish the location of the block (i.e., AV node versus His-Purkinje system) in 2:1 and
high-degree AV block. It may improve block in the His-Purkinje system by slowing the sinus and
AV nodal inputs to the His-Purkinje system, enabling the His-Purkinje system longer in which to
recover between inputs.
• Care should be taken when performing this maneuver and evaluation for carotid bruit should be
performed before it is attempted.
Echocardiogram
• Although it provides no direct diagnostic role for bradycardia, it provides valuable information
regarding underlying heart disease that can influence management and decision making. Patients
with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function may have underlying obstructive coronary

DIAGNOSIS
artery disease and should be considered for either noninvasive testing (such as myocardial
perfusion imaging) or invasive testing (coronary angiography) based on the index of clinical
suspicion. This is particularly important in the presence of left bundle branch block or right bundle
branch block and left anterior hemiblock in association with symptomatic bradycardia (e.g.,
syncope). These patients are more likely to develop bradycardia particularly due to AV block.
Patients who are found to have significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function should be
referred for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) if clinically appropriate.[41] 
Further investigations
Implantable-loop recorder
• A subcutaneous monitoring device used for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias. Typically
implanted under local anesthesia in the left parasternal or pectoral region. Small devices can be
inserted by a qualified physician using an injection approach, and can be used for monitoring for up
to 3 years.
• Useful modality if a patient has infrequent symptoms that are difficult to record with noninvasive
tools such as ECG, Holter monitors, and/or event monitors due to their infrequent nature, but are
suspected to be secondary to a bradyarrhythmia. It is safe and efficacious in these settings.[47]
[48]
• Also useful to rule out bradyarrhythmia as a cause of symptoms by identifying normal sinus rhythm
at the time of a symptom event of interest.
• May show sinus pauses, sinus arrest, second- or third-degree AV block, or severe sinus
bradycardia with symptoms. May be used if severe sinus node dysfunction (e.g., sinus exit block,
sinus pauses, sinus arrest, or tachy-brady syndrome) is suspected but cannot be documented. It is
particularly useful in diagnosing Mobitz I AV block.
Tilt-table testing
• Used to evaluate adequacy of the autonomic system, especially when there is suspicion of
neurocardiogenic syncope with a paroxysmal drop in heart rate due to vagal activation.[41]
• A commonly used method is head-upright tilting, which causes dependent venous pooling and
thereby provokes the autonomic response.
Electrophysiologic testing
• Recommended when symptoms cannot be correlated clearly and when significant
bradyarrhythmias are suspected based on presentation and other clinical information but cannot be
diagnosed by noninvasive modalities.[41]
• Electrophysiologic measurements of sinus node function serve only as an adjunct to clinical and
noninvasive parameters because these tests are based on assumptions that limit their validity and
clinical utility.
• There is little utility for electrophysiology testing in already documented second- and third-degree
AV block. Testing can be useful in patients with AV block and no clear symptom association; in
patients with symptoms of bradycardia in whom AV block is suspected but not documented; and
when the site of AV block cannot be determined reliably by surface tracings.
• His-ventricle interval of >100 milliseconds in a patient with bradycardia, even in the absence of
symptoms, is a high-risk finding.[49] [50]
• Overall, the role of electrophysiologic testing for bradycardia is limited, owing to low sensitivity and
specificity. Positive findings may not be the reason for patient symptoms.[51] [52]

Bradycardia Diagnosis
• May be used if severe sinus node dysfunction (e.g., sinus exit block, sinus pauses, sinus arrest,
tachy-brady syndrome) is suspected but cannot be documented.
• Atrial pacing at progressively shorter cycle lengths during an electrophysiology study can manifest
Mobitz type I in subjects with normal or abnormal AV node conduction.
• Useful to demonstrate the location of the block (i.e., AV node versus His-Purkinje system) in 2:1
and high-degree AV block.
Nocturnal pulse oximetry or overnight polysomnography
• Useful for patients with symptoms suspicious for SDB, including daytime somnolence, multiple
night-time awakenings, morning headaches, loud snoring, and dry mouth on awakening.
• Prior to pacemaker placement, patients with risk factors for SDB should be evaluated with
polysomnography. In one small study, eight patients with asymptomatic bradyarrhythmias were
referred for pacemaker evaluation; seven of the patients had bradyarrhythmias only at night or
during the day while asleep.[53] Patients with symptoms suggestive of sleep apnea were referred
for overnight polysomnography studies that were all positive for obstructive sleep apnea. Treatment
for sleep apnea led to reduced sleep apnea symptoms and continued asymptomatic nocturnal
bradyarrhythmias without pacemaker therapy after a 22-month follow-up. Therefore, it is paramount
to screen patients for sleep apnea when presenting with nocturnal bradycardia before pacemaker
placement. This is especially true when asymptomatic nocturnal bradycardias are noted on
inpatient overnight cardiac monitoring, or home-based smartphone or watch sleep monitoring apps.
• Guidelines recommend that all patients with bradycardia or conduction disorder during sleep and
documented SDB should be treated for SDB.[11] [25]
• Particularly in patients with nocturnal bradyarrhythmias or conduction disturbances that are
asymptomatic, treatment of obstructive sleep apnea may prevent progression to symptomatic
conduction delays.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
pulse rate <50 bpm (common)
• Palpation of peripheral pulse or cardiac auscultation may reveal a slow, regular heart beat of <50 bpm
or an irregular pulse of varying intensity. Slow pulse may be due to other causes such as frequent
ventricular ectopy.
• While some consider bradycardia to be a heart rate <60 bpm, this is in dispute and most consider
rates of <50 bpm to represent bradycardia.
age >70 years (common)
• Older patients present frequently with bradycardia owing to disease in the sinus node, the
atrioventricular (AV) node, or the His-Purkinje system. In the AV conduction system, age-related
fibrosis and sclerosis (Lenegre-Lev disease) account for AV block in almost half of the cases.
• Older patients are also more likely to present with bradycardia induced by medications with AV-node
blocking properties.

use of known causative medications (common)
• These are primarily medications that have atrioventricular-node-blocking properties, such as beta-
blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and digoxin.
presence of known underlying cause (common)
• A history of infection, infiltrative diseases, increased intracranial pressure, electrolyte disorders,
exposure to toxins, surgery, heart transplant, sleep-disordered breathing, or myocardial infarction may
be present.
• Sinus bradycardia is usually noted in patients with significant hypothyroidism, whether or not they have
other symptoms of the disease.
• Asymptomatic or symptomatic sinus bradycardia may occur in association with hypothermia.
dizziness/lightheadedness (common)
• Occurs owing to bradycardia-induced cerebral hypoperfusion, especially in the setting of left
ventricular dysfunction.
syncope (common)
• Syncope is possible with long sinus nodal pauses or very slow heart rates due to AV block.
• Occurs owing to bradycardia-induced cerebral hypoperfusion, especially in the setting of left
ventricular dysfunction.
• Common in patients with complete heart block and a very slow ventricular escape rhythm with left
ventricular dysfunction and in patients with second-degree atrioventricular block.
fatigue (common)
• Many patients complain of worsening fatigue. This should also prompt evaluation for sleep-disordered
breathing or hypothyroidism as a potential cause of bradycardia.
exercise intolerance (common)
• May be owing to sinus node, atrioventricular node, or His-Purkinje system disease.
shortness of breath (common)
• May be owing to sinus node, atrioventricular node, or His-Purkinje system disease.
cannon a-waves in jugular venous pulse (common)
• Patients with bradycardia secondary to complete heart block can have intermittent cannon a-waves in
their jugular venous pulse noted, owing to atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve. Similarly,
there may be a variable S1 during complete atrioventricular block.
• During a junctional or ventricular rhythm with 1:1 V-to-A conduction, there may be cannon a-waves for
each heart beat.
jugular venous distension (common)
• Owing to heart failure caused by bradycardia, or severe pulmonary hypertension from longstanding
untreated sleep-disordered breathing.

Risk factors
Strong
use of known causative medications
• Cardiac medications that can cause or accentuate bradycardia include: (1) antihypertensives: beta-

sotalol, dronedarone), adenosine, and digoxin.[3] [20] The effect is often dose- and drug-level
dependent, which, in turn, will depend on factors affecting drug metabolism, such as patient age,
renal function, and hepatic function. Ivabradine, a selective inhibitor of a sodium-potassium channel
expressed in the sino-atrial node, slows the sinus rate and is used specifically for this purpose. It can
cause sinus bradycardia.
• Other non-cardiac medications that can cause bradycardia include: (1) psychoactive agents:
cholinesterase inhibitors (e,g., donepezil), phenothiazine anti-emetic drugs (e.g., prochlorperazine,
chlorpromazine), lithium, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors;
(2) others: calcium chloride, calcium gluconate, opioids (e.g., fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil),
cannabinoids, anticholinergic agents (e.g., benztropine), chemotherapy agents (e.g., paclitaxel),
cimetidine, thalidomide, organophosphates (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide), topical ophthalmic acetylcholine,
sedatives (e.g., dexmedetomidine, propofol).
• Drugs that contribute to atrioventricular (AV) block and/or sinus node dysfunction may only be
uncovering an underlying "occult" problem.[31]
age >70 years
• Older patients are at greater risk for developing sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular nodal
disease, which are the major causes of bradycardia in this patient cohort. Older patients also have an
increased use of rate-limiting drugs; this increases the risk of drug-related bradycardia, particularly in
those with atrial fibrillation.[21]
• In general, bradycardia is related to degeneration of the conduction system and the sinus node and
changes in autonomic tone, which tends to worsen with age.[9] [32] [33] [34]
recent myocardial infarction
• Acute myocardial infarction can cause bradycardia. An inferior infarction from right coronary artery
occlusion could lead to conduction block in the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node is supplied
by the AV nodal artery, which branches from the proximal portion of the posterior descending artery,
which arises from the right coronary artery 80% of the time, the circumflex 10%, and both 10%. Sinus
bradycardia and AV block owing to inferior infarction is often caused by the Bezold-Jarisch reflex
(i.e., a transient increased vagal activation). Consequently, bradycardia following inferior infarction
often resolves. However, permanent AV block is generally caused by an anterior myocardial infarction
affecting the bundle of His or His-Purkinje system. The sinus node receives its blood supply from
the sinus node artery, which originates from the proximal right coronary artery 65% of the time,
circumflex artery 25%, and both 10%. Infarct or ischemia to any of these arteries may lead to sinus
node dysfunction.
• Common causes for sinus bradycardia and AV block in the setting of acute myocardial infarction can
also be iatrogenic and include the use of beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, anti-arrhythmics,
and morphine; high levels of pain; increased vagal tone; and atrial ischemia.[3] [35] [36] [37]
surgery
• Sinus bradycardia is common intraoperatively owing to maneuvers that increase vagal tone, such as
intubation. If intra-operative hypothermia is planned, sinus bradycardia will almost certainly occur. It
may also occur after hydrogen peroxide irrigation during neurosurgery.
• Sinus bradycardia is also common postoperatively, mainly owing to pain, use of opioids, or the effects
of the surgery itself.

Bradycardia Diagnosis
• Bradycardia can be due to injury to the sinus node during heart-transplant surgery. Sinus node
disease can become apparent after a Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries and
repair of an atrial septal defect.
• Atrioventricular (AV) block can occur after mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and/or aortic valve surgery, and
after ventricular septal defect repair.
percutaneous valve replacement procedures
• Conduction abnormalities are a well-known complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(TAVR). It is hypothesized that injury to the conduction tissues occurs due to direct trauma from
surgery, hemorrhage, compression, ischemia, or infarction. It is estimated that 8.8% of post-TAVR
patients develop conduction delays or even complete heart block and require pacemaker placement
after 30 days. About half of these patients remain pacemaker dependent; the other half are thought
to have paroxysmal conduction delays. Pre-existing right bundle branch block, larger prosthesis to
left ventricular outflow tract diameter ratio, and smaller left ventricular end-diastolic diameter have
been found to be predictors of pacemaker placement. In post-operative patients who underwent mitral
valve repair or replacement and develop new sinus node dysfunction or AV block associated with
persistent symptoms or hemodynamic instability, permanent pacing is recommended prior to hospital
discharge. Additionally, in post-operative patients who underwent TAVR and develop new AV block
with persistent symptoms or hemodynamic instability, permanent pacing is also recommended prior to
hospital discharge. [38] [39]
hypothyroidism
• Sinus bradycardia is usually noted in patients with significant hypothyroidism, whether or not they have
other symptoms of the disease, including signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.[3]
electrolyte disorders
• Hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and/or hypocalcemia can cause bradycardia.
• Hyperkalemia tends to be the most common abnormality seen; it causes bradycardia by causing a
sinoventricular rhythm or atrioventricular block.[3]
• Electrolyte disorders should be screened for in all patients with bradycardia because this is easily
correctable.
acidosis
• Acidosis has been shown to have profound effects on the conduction pathways, particularly the
atrioventricular node. Acidosis can lead to slowed nodal conduction, prolonged refractory period, and
even complete heart block. Acidosis could be the result of myocardial infarction or other insult.[40]
infections
• Typhoid fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, rheumatic fever, viral myocarditis, and Lyme
disease have all been associated with bradycardia.
exposure to toxins
• Lead exposure, black widow spider venom, and tricyclic antidepressant overdose have all been
associated with bradycardia.
hypothermia
• Hypothermia can lead to bradycardia. This can be seen with environmental exposures, during surgery,
or as part of cooling protocols after cardiac arrest.

DIAGNOSIS
infiltrative diseases
• Infiltrative disease, such as amyloidosis, Chagas disease, sarcoidosis, or hemochromatosis, may also
affect the conduction system of the heart, causing bradycardia. Rheumatologic conditions such as
collagen vascular disease or systemic lupus erythematosus can also cause bradycardia.
sleep-disordered breathing
• Sinus node arrest, sinus bradycardia, and second-degree atrioventricular block are all manifestations
of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), comprising obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and
Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Nocturnal bradyarrhythmias should prompt an investigation for SBD.[25]
Weak
epilepsy
• Rarely, bradycardia may be associated with seemingly unrelated clinical conditions. Bradycardia can
be rarely associated with epilepsy, and should be considered in patients with unusual presentations of
syncope or in patients with a history suggestive of both epilepsy and syncope. Ictal bradycardia and
ictal asystole predominantly occur in association with focal seizures, with loss of awareness in people
with mainly left lateralized temporal lobe seizures, and are associated with electroencephalogram
signs of brain ischemia during these episodes.[30]

12-lead ECG
• Sinus bradycardia: regular P-wave followed by QRS at a rate of <50
bpm. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is helpful to correlate symptoms
with heart rate.[41]
• Sinus nodal pauses or arrest: long RR cycle length, which is longer
than the RR interval of the underlying sinus rhythm.

• Sinus nodal exit block: an absent P-wave and prolongation of the RR
cycle length, usually twice the underlying sinus RR interval.
• Tachy-brady syndrome: episodic periods of tachycardia (usually atrial
flutter, atrial fibrillation, or atrial tachycardia), followed by termination
of the tachycardia leading to sinus arrest or long sinus pauses,
followed by sinus bradycardia.

to stay the same or shortens.[14]

• 2:1 AV block: only one PR interval to examine before the blocked
P-wave and 2 P-waves for every QRS complex. Block can be at
the level of the AV node or the His-Purkinje system. If the QRS is
narrow, the level of the block is probably in the AV node (which is
more benign). If the QRS is wide (owing to bundle-branch block or
other conduction delay), block in the AV node is still most common
but block in the His-Purkinje system is more frequent than when the
QRS complex is narrow.

Screening ECGs and Holter monitoring may be considered for special patient populations, such as those
with muscular dystrophies (e.g., myotonic dystrophy type 1, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, peroneal muscular
dystrophy, or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy), which affect the conduction system of the heart specifically.
Patients with neuromuscular diseases associated with conduction disorders, including myotonic dystrophy
type 1 or Kearns-Sayre syndrome, who have evidence of second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, third-
degree AV block, or an abnormal electrophysiology study (H-V interval of ≥70 ms) should be referred
for pacemaker (or implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] if there is concomitant systolic dysfunction)
implantation regardless of symptoms if meaningful survival of more than 1 year is expected.[11]
Genetic screening for patients with bradycardia is not routinely recommended. Genetic mutations affecting
AV conduction (e.g., SCN5A) or sinus node function (e.g., HCN4) account for a small proportion of patients
who present with bradycardia. Genetic counseling followed by targeted genetic testing, and close clinical
monitoring for development of sinus node dysfunction or AV conduction abnormalities, may be considered
for asymptomatic first-degree relatives of an individual with a genetic mutation known to be associated with
bradycardia (index case).[11][41]

Bradycardia Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Management of bradycardia depends on multiple factors, such as the acuity and severity at presentation, the
nature and reversibility of precipitating events, and underlying electrophysiologic and cardiac abnormalities. It
is important to identify whether patients have symptoms attributable to bradycardia by taking a careful history,
especially when incidentally detected on heart rhythm monitoring either at home or in the hospital. Patients
presenting with hemodynamic compromise, signs of cerebral hypoperfusion, progressive heart failure, or life-
threatening arrhythmias secondary to bradycardia require urgent treatment, including the use of temporary
pacing.
The most common reversible causes of bradycardia include drug-induced bradycardia related to drugs such
as beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and anti-arrhythmic drugs; increased vagal tone; and electrolyte
abnormalities. A detailed review of the patient's home medications is important, especially for patients with
hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, seizure
disorders, and psychiatric illnesses. In patients on multiple medications at home, a check for drug-drug
interactions that may lead to drug toxicity should be performed. A significant number of these patients may
have resolution of bradycardia after adjustment and/or discontinuation of offending medications, and may
not require permanent pacemaker implantation. On the other hand, patients who need to be on rate-lowering
medications (e.g., beta-blockers in patients with coronary artery disease) may need permanent pacemaker
implantation in order to stay on these medications.
The role of medications to treat bradycardia is generally limited to emergency situations. Permanent pacing is
the principal therapeutic modality for the management of persistent bradycardia.
Hemodynamically unstable patients
Bradycardia associated with hemodynamic compromise (i.e., systemic hypotension, signs of cerebral
hypoperfusion, progressive heart failure, or angina) or life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia
represents a true medical emergency. Medical therapy should be started immediately, regardless of the
cause, and continued until temporary cardiac pacing is initiated.
The most common medications used to increase ventricular rate are intravenous atropine and
epinephrine. Dobutamine can also be considered, especially when there is evidence of concomitant
systolic heart failure. Some clinicians use isoproterenol, as it is the strongest beta agonist. However,
isoproterenol may perpetuate hypotension, if present, due to its vasodilatory effects, and so is not
generally recommended. Epinephrine, on the other hand, due to its combined alpha and beta agonist
properties, may help increase blood pressure as well as heart rate. In post-cardiac transplant patients
without evidence of autonomic reinnervation, atropine should not be used due to the risk of paradoxical
complete heart block. For post-cardiac transplant patients and patients with acute spinal cord injury,
aminophylline or theophylline are reasonable choices to treat bradycardia.[11] Where an underlying cause
can be identified (e.g., prescription drug toxicity), this should be addressed.
Patients who are not responsive to medical therapy require prompt temporary pacing. The two most
commonly used modes of temporary pacing are transcutaneous and transvenous.
Transcutaneous pacing can be applied rapidly through external adhesive electrodes. However, this pacing
modality usually serves as a bridge to transvenous pacing because it causes painful skeletal muscle
stimulation and usually requires sedation. Furthermore, the efficacy of transcutaneous pacing to provide
stable ventricular capture is limited to 78% to 94%.[54] [55] It can be used as a sole temporary pacing

modality to provide back-up in some patients with transient, infrequent, and short-lived episodes of
bradycardia until a reversible cause is corrected or a permanent pacemaker is implanted.
Transvenous pacing is the most secure and effective modality for patients who require continuous
temporary pacing. The temporary pacing lead is usually placed in the right ventricle or, rarely, in the right
atrium or both chambers using a central vein (femoral, subclavian, or internal jugular). A mechanical
prosthetic tricuspid valve is a contraindication to right ventricular pacing. Complications are common (up
to 20%) and related most commonly to venous access, infection, thromboembolism, heart perforation, or
lead dislodgement. Ideally, pacing should not exceed more than a few days because of the incremental
risk of infection.[54] [55]
Hemodynamically stable patients: general approach
These patients are treated according to the underlying cause and usually require either temporary or
permanent pacing, depending on whether sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) conduction
disturbance is present. Permanent pacing is the only available therapeutic modality for persistent
bradycardia problems owing to nonreversible causes.
When permanent pacing is being considered, it is essential to establish a clear association between
bradycardia and symptoms attributable to bradycardia, since many ambulatory patients may have
asymptomatic bradycardia and do not necessarily need permanent pacemaker implantation. Testing for
underlying structural heart disease, especially evaluation of left ventricular systolic function, is essential
before making a decision regarding the type of device (pacemaker versus implantable cardioverter
defibrillator [ICD]) to be implanted. Whenever possible, attempts should be made to use atrial pacing and
native atrio-ventricular conduction in order to reduce the burden of right ventricular pacing, especially in
patients with normal ventricular systolic function. Chronic right ventricular pacing can cause or worsen
ventricular dyssynchrony, which can cause deterioration in left ventricular systolic function. Single-
chamber pacing (either using a conventional right ventricular pacing lead or using a leadless pacemaker)
should only be considered in patients in whom the anticipated pacing burden is low.
Pacing modes are described by a 5-letter code.
• The first letter designates the chamber that is paced (O is none; A is atrium; V is ventricle; D is dual
chamber).
• The second letter is the chamber in which sensing occurs (O is none; A is atrium; V is ventricle; D
is dual chamber).
• The third letter is the response to sensed event (O is none; I is inhibition; T is triggered; D is both
inhibition and triggering).
• The fourth letter usually refers to the rate response (R).
• The fifth letter refers to antitachycardia capabilities and is not used commonly.
All modern pacemakers are multiprogrammable. The choice of the specific pacemaker mode is usually
dictated by the underlying electrophysiologic abnormality.
Shared decision-making should be undertaken whenever an intracardiac device (pacemaker or ICD)
is being considered as a treatment option. This involves a detailed conversation between the patient
and the various healthcare providers about the potential benefits, risks, complications (both short-term
and long-term), and alternative treatment options (if available) pertaining to device implantation. This
conversation should be individualized to the patient's clinical condition, and should incorporate the
patient's own beliefs, values, goals, and expectations of the clinical care being provided. In addition,
information regarding ambulatory device monitoring, need for arm movement restrictions for a few

weeks post-implant, avoidance of certain activities (e.g., using high-energy arc welding equipment) in
pacemaker-dependent patients, and future need for generator changes and possible lead revisions or
device upgrades, should be provided.
Hemodynamically stable: sinus node dysfunction
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms
• In patients with sinus node dysfunction owing to a reversible or isolated cause (e.g., specific
medication, electrolyte disorder, or vasovagal event, such as a blood draw), the underlying cause
should be addressed (e.g., stopping responsible drug, correction of electrolyte abnormality,
regulation of thyroid dysfunction). Theophylline may be used in selected patients with mild
symptoms, such as predominantly exertional dizziness and/or fatigue.[56] [57]
• In patients with sinus node dysfunction owing to a nonreversible cause and no symptoms or
minimal symptoms, no specific treatment is required.[11] [41]
Severe symptoms
• Acute treatment is needed if there are severe symptoms or sequelae, including syncope, near-
syncope, hypotension, marked fatigue, or ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes). In
patients with a nonreversible cause, the role of pharmacotherapy is limited and permanent pacing
is the treatment of choice. In patients with a reversible cause, temporary pacing is needed and
underlying causes should be corrected.
• Atrial-based (AAI), ventricle-based (VVI), and dual chamber (DDD) pacing modes are all useful
in correcting bradycardia caused by sinus node dysfunction, although the optimal pacing mode
remains controversial. Nonetheless, growing evidence indicates that AAI, which avoids pacing
of the ventricle, is associated with a relatively lower risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure.[58]
Because patients with sinus node disease are at risk of the development of AV block or atrial
fibrillation, DDD pacemakers incorporating algorithms that enable the minimization of right
ventricular pacing (functional AAI pacing) are preferred over the single-lead AAI system.[59] [60]
Concomitant impaired systolic left ventricular function
• Patients need to be evaluated for possible ICD placement. This can be accomplished by imaging
(echocardiography, or less commonly, cardiac computed tomography or cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging) to assess left ventricular systolic function. If new left ventricular systolic
dysfunction is identified during evaluation of a patient with bradycardia, exclusion of underlying
structural heart disease and coronary artery disease should be done prior to permanent device
implantation.
• Accumulating evidence suggests that right ventricular pacing in patients with systolic left ventricular
dysfunction may be associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, worsening heart failure,
and mortality secondary to left ventricular desynchronization. Therefore, pacing of the ventricle
should be avoided in patients who do not need it.[58] [61] Dual-chamber pacemakers incorporating
algorithms that enable the minimization of ventricular pacing (functional AAI pacing) are preferred
in these patients.[62]
Hemodynamically stable: acquired AV block
Asymptomatic patients
• Permanent pacing is indicated only when any of the following are present: high-grade AV block,
Mobitz type II second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, or evidence of infranodal block that

is not caused by a physiologic mechanism or reversible cause, regardless of symptoms. In addition,
patients who underwent catheter ablation of the AV junction; or those who develop persistent
AV block after surgical or transcutaneous implantation of aortic or mitral valve prostheses, or
after surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; and those
with certain specific neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myotonic dystrophy type 1 or Kearns-Sayre
syndrome) and infiltrative cardiomyopathies (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis) with any of the above AV
conduction abnormalities, should undergo permanent pacemaker implantation.[11] [41]
Symptomatic patients
• In addition to symptomatic patients who fall into one of the above categories, patients with
persistent atrial fibrillation and symptomatic bradycardia, and patients with symptomatic
bradycardia who need to be on rate-lowering medications for long-term guideline-directed
management of another cardiac condition (e.g. coronary artery disease, systolic congestive heart
failure), should be referred for permanent pacemaker implantation.[11]
• VVI, DDD, or atrial synchronous-ventricular inhibited (VDD) pacing modes are useful in correcting
bradycardia caused by AV block. Although the optimal pacing mode remains controversial, modes
that preserve atrioventricular synchrony (VDD or DDD) are preferred.
• Among patients who have a clear indication for permanent pacemaker implantation, moderate
to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (estimated left ventricular ejection fraction between
36% and 50%), and a high (>40%) expected burden of ventricular pacing, one should consider
the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy or biventricular pacemaker implantation, or consider
implantation of a conduction system pacemaker.[11]
• Patients with symptomatic bradycardia in whom the level of AV block is at the level of the AV
node (supra-Hisian AV block) should be considered for a His-bundle lead-based dual chamber
pacemaker instead of a conventional right ventricular lead-based dual chamber pacemaker, to
reduce the long-term deleterious effects of chronic right ventricular pacing.
Reversible cause
• Underlying cause should be addressed (e.g., ceasing drug treatment, administration of electrolytes,
or correction of thyroid dysfunction).[11] [41]
• Temporary pacing should be considered when any of the following is present: high-grade AV block,
Mobitz type II second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, or evidence of infranodal block,
regardless of symptoms. After correction of reversible causes, reassessment of AV conduction
should be performed before a clinical decision about permanent pacemaker implantation is made.
Nonreversible cause
• Permanent pacing is the only available therapeutic modality for persistent acquired AV block that is
a result of nonreversible causes.
• As a general rule, all symptomatic patients with AV block require permanent pacing regardless of
the specific type or anatomic level of AV block.
• VVI, DDD, and VDD pacing modes are useful in correcting bradycardia caused by AV block.
Although the optimal pacing mode remains controversial, modes that preserve atrioventricular
synchrony (VDD or DDD) are preferred.

and mortality secondary to left ventricular desynchronization. Therefore, pacing of the ventricle
should be avoided in patients with preserved AV conduction.[58] [61] Cardiac resynchronization
therapy (biventricular pacing) was superior to right ventricular pacing in reducing a composite of all-
cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and left ventricular end systolic volume in patients with
left ventricular ejection fraction <50%; New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, II, or III; and
>40% right ventricular pacing (e.g., patients with AV block).[63] Whether the same results apply
to patients with bradycardia and normal ejection fraction requiring >40% right ventricular pacing
remains unclear.
Hemodynamically stable: congenital complete AV block
Treatment approach to patients with congenital complete AV block continues to evolve. There is a general
consensus that permanent pacing is indicated for all symptomatic patients or for asymptomatic patients
with any of the following: wide QRS escape rhythm, complex ventricular arrhythmia, a mean daytime
heart rate of less than 50 bpm, or impaired systolic left ventricular function. In addition, patients with
adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) who have significant AV conduction abnormalities (high-grade
AV block, Mobitz II second-degree AV block, or third-degree AV block that is not expected to resolve)
should undergo permanent pacemaker implantation, and pacemaker algorithms that reduce the risk of
atrial arrhythmias should be incorporated in these devices.[11] Although not agreed on universally, pacing
should be considered strongly in asymptomatic patients with ventricular escape rhythm of <50 bpm or
prolonged ventricular pauses. Some data suggest that early institution of pacing in asymptomatic patients
may improve survival. However, whether or not all asymptomatic patients with congenital AV block require
permanent pacemaker implantation remains controversial. Pacing modes that preserve atrioventricular
synchrony (VDD or DDD) are usually used.
Concomitant impaired systolic left ventricular function
• Patients need to be evaluated for possible ICD placement.
• Accumulating evidence suggests that right ventricular pacing in patients with systolic left ventricular
dysfunction may be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, worsening heart failure, and
mortality secondary to left ventricular desynchronization. Therefore, pacing of the ventricle should
be avoided in patients with preserved AV conduction.[58] [61]
• Cardiac resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacing) was superior to right ventricular pacing in
reducing a composite of all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and left ventricular end
systolic volume in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50%; NYHA class I, II, or III; and
>40% right ventricular pacing (e.g., patients with AV block).[63] Current guidelines recommend that
either biventricular pacing or conduction system pacing should be preferred over right ventricular
pacing for patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 36% and 50% and AV block, who
have an indication for permanent pacing and are expected to require ventricular pacing >40% of
the time to reduce the risk of developing systolic heart failure.[11] Whether the same results apply
to patients with bradycardia and normal ejection fraction requiring >40% right ventricular pacing
remains unclear.
Hemodynamically stable: vagally mediated bradycardia
Bradycardia mediated by increased vagal activation and peripheral vasodilation secondary to reduced
sympathetic activity are integral parts of the neurocardiogenic response manifested by systemic
hypotension. In this clinical situation, treating bradycardia in itself may be ineffective in alleviating

Bradycardia Management
symptoms in many patients with neurocardiogenic events. Understanding the relative contribution of the
mechanisms in each individual case is critical in defining the therapeutic approach.
Carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome
• Pacing may be indicated for patients with recurrent symptoms who demonstrate a hyperactive
response to carotid sinus massage (defined as ventricular asystolic pause of >3 seconds), are
thought to have symptoms owing to hypersensitive carotid sinus, and have no other explainable
cause for syncope.
• Patients without these indications do not require treatment.
Neurocardiogenic or vasovagal syncope:
• The initial approach is usually based on education and lifestyle modification regardless of the
intrinsic autonomic mechanism underlying syncopal events. The main aspects of this approach
include:
• Identification and avoidance of precipitating factors
• Measures to be taken during impending events, such as lying down, elevation of legs, and
tensing maneuvers
• Adequate fluid and salt intake.
• Data documenting specific therapy for vasovagal syncope are sparse. Multiple drugs with
different mechanisms have been used with no or little documented benefit.[64] [65] Isolated
studies demonstrating benefit of medical therapies, including fluoxetine, have been published.[66]
European guidelines state that fludrocortisone should be considered in young patients with
orthostatic vasovagal syncope with low-to-normal arterial blood pressure, while midodrine should
be considered in patients with vasovagal syncope and orthostatic symptoms. Beta-blocking agents
are not generally indicated for the management of neurocardiogenic syncope.[67]
• Use of permanent pacing should be reserved for patients with recurrent severe episodes of
syncope refractory to medical therapy who have significant asystolic episodes documented during
clinical events. In such patients, dual-chamber permanent pacing with rate-drop response or closed
loop stimulation should be the preferred pacing mode.[68] [69]
• Heart-rate response observed during tilt-table testing may not correlate with that during clinical
events and should be used with caution for the selection of patients who may or may not benefit
from pacing.
• When pacing is considered for neurocardiogenic syncope, the DDD pacing mode is considered
to be the preferred pacing mode. The value of programmable pacemaker features such as rate-
drop response (during which the rate increases abruptly if a gradual slowing is seen), or closed
loop stimulation (during which pacing rate increases if there is evidence of changes in local
impedance that may reflect changes in right ventricular contractility by a proprietary algorithm), may
be beneficial.[64] [65]
Hemodynamically stable: bradycardia associated with neurologic
disorders
• Bradycardia in patients with neurologic disorders can be acute (e.g., Cushing reflex associated
with increased intracranial pressure) or chronic. In many situations, the bradycardia may be
transient, and clinical monitoring of the bradycardia may be preferable. However, after elimination
of reversible causes of bradycardia in these patients, permanent pacing may be needed in a small
proportion of patients with neurologic disorders.

Bradycardia Management
MANAGEMENT
• In patients with epilepsy associated with severe symptomatic bradycardia (ictal bradycardia) that is
not controlled with anticonvulsants, permanent pacing is a reasonable treatment option for reducing
the severity of symptoms.[11]
• Patients diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy type 1 or Kearns-Sayre syndrome, who have evidence
of second-degree atrioventricular block, third-degree atrioventricular block, or an abnormal
electrophysiology study (H-V interval of greater than or equal to 70 ms), should be referred
for pacemaker (or ICD if there is concomitant systolic dysfunction) implantation regardless of
symptoms, if meaningful survival of more than 1 year is expected.[11] [41]
• Patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (above the sixth thoracic vertebra level) can have
episodes of profound bradycardia in response to painful or noxious stimuli, due to impaired
sympathetic innervation and autonomic dysreflexia. These episodes usually resolve over time and
with elimination of noxious stimuli, and conservative measures and watchful waiting for resolution of
symptomatic bradycardia is preferable.[11]
Special considerations for frail patients
• According to an expert consensus document, the prevalence of bradycardia and bradyarrhythmias
increases with advanced age and the presence of comorbid conditions. Increased frailty may
be associated with reduced sinoatrial node function, slowing of electrical conduction, which may
manifest in the form of reduced heart rate, blunted heart rate response to exercise, as well as
worsening AV and intraventricular conduction.[70]
• Frail patients may have reduced capacity for metabolizing cardiovascular medications including
rate lowering medications and antiarrhythmic medications, unpredictable pharmacokinetics, and
worsening hepatic and/or renal function-making them more vulnerable to drug-induced adverse
effects and dose-limiting bradycardia.[70]
• Frail patients on multiple medications may also have drug-drug interactions which may further
impact the choice and dose of cardiovascular medications. Caution must be exercised in
prescribing rate lowering and antiarrhythmic medications in frail patients. Particular care should
be taken to review the patient's comorbid conditions and previously prescribed medications before
starting cardiac medications in frail patients.[70]
• Closer monitoring of renal function, as well as hepatic and endocrine function if relevant, is
recommended in frail patients, and dosages adjusted accordingly. Certain medications such as
digoxin should be avoided in the elderly and frail patients due to concern for development of digoxin
toxicity, even at lower serum levels.[70]
• Existing guidelines recommend consideration of patient frailty when deciding between cardiac
resynchronization therapy (CRT)-pacemaker over CRT-defibrillator implantation, and also stressed
the need for a comprehensive review of the patient's clinical condition and risk/benefit ratio of
cardiac device implantation in elderly and/or frail patients.[70]
• Procedural complications from pacemaker implantation such as pneumothorax, lead dislodgment,
and device erosion due to low body weight are more common in the frail and elderly patients.[70]
• Frail patients with high-grade AV block or infrequent pauses due to sinus node dysfunction or
intermittent high-grade AV block should be considered for single-chamber pacemaker implantation
rather than dual-chamber pacing, using either a transvenous single-lead right ventricular
pacemaker or a transcutaneous leadless pacemaker.[70] For more detailed information, see Frailty

at the level of the atrioventricular (AV) node.
However, patients with infranodal conduction

worsening bradycardia.
» Address underlying cause where one can be
identified (e.g., prescription drug toxicity).
adjunct temporary pacing
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients who are not responsive to medical
therapy require prompt temporary pacing. The
two most commonly used modes of temporary
pacing are transcutaneous and transvenous.
» Transcutaneous pacing can be applied rapidly
through external adhesive electrodes. However,
this pacing modality usually serves as a bridge
to transvenous pacing because it causes
painful skeletal muscle stimulation and usually
requires sedation. Furthermore, the efficacy
of transcutaneous pacing to provide stable
ventricular capture is limited to 78% to 94%.[54]
[55] It can be used as a sole temporary pacing
modality to provide backup in some patients with
transient, infrequent, and short-lived episodes of
bradycardia until a reversible cause is corrected
or a permanent pacemaker is implanted.
» Transvenous pacing is the most secure and
effective modality for patients who require
continuous temporary pacing. The temporary
pacing lead is usually placed in the right ventricle
or, rarely, in the right atrium or both chambers
using one of the central veins (femoral,
subclavian, or internal jugular). A mechanical
prosthetic tricuspid valve is a contraindication
to right ventricular pacing. Complications are
common (up to 20%) and relate most commonly
to venous access, infection, thromboembolism,
heart perforation, or lead dislodgement. Ideally,
pacing should not exceed more than a few days
because of the incremental risk of infection.[54]

mechanism or reversible cause, regardless of
symptoms. In addition, patients who underwent
catheter ablation of the AV junction; or those
who develop persistent AV block after surgical
or transcutaneous implantation of aortic or
mitral valve prostheses, or after surgical
myectomy or alcohol septal ablation for
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; and those with
certain specific neuromuscular diseases (e.g.,
myotonic dystrophy type 1 or Kearns-Sayre
syndrome) and infiltrative cardiomyopathies
(sarcoidosis, amyloidosis) with any of the above
AV conduction abnormalities, should undergo
permanent pacemaker implantation.[11]
» Additionally, patients with persistent atrial
fibrillation and symptomatic bradycardia, and
patients with symptomatic bradycardia who
need to be on rate-lowering medications for
long-term guideline-directed management of
another cardiac condition (e.g., coronary artery
disease, systolic congestive heart failure),
should be referred for permanent pacemaker
implantation.[11]
» As a general rule, all symptomatic patients with
AV block require permanent pacing regardless
of the specific type or anatomic level of AV
block. Permanent pacing is the only available
therapeutic modality for persistent acquired AV
block as a result of nonreversible causes.
» Ventricle-based (VVI), dual chamber (DDD),
and atrial synchronous-ventricular inhibited
(VDD) pacing modes are useful in correcting
bradycardia caused by AV block. Although the
optimal pacing mode remains controversial,
modes that preserve atrioventricular synchrony
(VDD or DDD) are preferred.
» Consider the use of a biventricular pacemaker
or a conduction system pacemaker in patients
who need pacing and have a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 36% to 50%, and a high
(>40%) expected burden of ventricular pacing.
» Symptomatic bradycardia in patients in whom
the level of AV block is at the level of the AV
node should be considered for a His-bundle
lead-based dual chamber pacemaker.
» Accumulating evidence suggests that right
ventricular pacing in patients with systolic left
ventricular dysfunction may be associated with
increased risk of atrial fibrillation, worsening
heart failure, and mortality secondary to left
ventricular desynchronization. Therefore, pacing

should also be considered strongly in
asymptomatic patients with ventricular escape
rhythm of <50 bpm or prolonged ventricular
pauses. If these indications are absent, no
specific treatment is required and the patient can

rate of <50 bpm, or impaired systolic left
ventricular function.
» In addition, patients with adult congenital
heart disease (ACHD) who have significant
atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities
(high-grade AV block, Mobitz II second-degree
AV block, or third-degree AV block that is
not expected to resolve) should undergo
permanent pacemaker implantation, and
pacemaker algorithms that reduce the risk of
atrial arrhythmias should be incorporated in
these devices.[11]

(defined as ventricular asystolic pause of >3
seconds), are thought to have symptoms owing
to hypersensitive carotid sinus, and have no
other explainable cause for syncope.

» Initial approach is usually based on education
and lifestyle modification, regardless of the
intrinsic autonomic mechanism underlying
syncopal events.
» The main aspects of this approach include:
identification and avoidance of precipitating
factors; measures to be taken during impending
events, such as lying down, elevation of legs,
and tensing maneuvers; adequate fluid and salt
intake.

Bradycardia Management
Acute
» Multiple drugs with different mechanisms
have been used; however, none of them have
improved outcome in prospective controlled
trials.[64] [65]
» Medical therapy is usually considered
in patients who do not respond to lifestyle
modifications. The choice of the drug is made on
an individual basis.
» The most commonly used drugs are
fludrocortisone, midodrine, and selective
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
» European guidelines state that fludrocortisone
should be considered in young patients with
orthostatic vasovagal syncope with low-to-
normal arterial blood pressure, while midodrine
should be considered in patients with vasovagal
syncope and orthostatic symptoms.[67]
3rd permanent pacing
» Pacing is reserved for patients with recurrent
severe episodes of syncope refractory to medical
therapy who have significant bradycardia
documented during clinical events.
» Heart-rate response observed during tilt-table
testing may not correlate with that during clinical
events and should be used with caution for the
selection of patients who may or may not benefit
from pacing.
» When pacing is considered for
neurocardiogenic syncope, the dual chamber
(DDD) pacing mode is considered to be
the preferred pacing mode. The value of
programmable pacemaker features such as
rate-drop response (during which the rate
increases abruptly if a gradual slowing is seen),
or closed loop stimulation (during which pacing
rate increases if there is evidence of changes
in local impedance that may reflect changes
in right ventricular contractility by a proprietary
algorithm), may be beneficial.[64] [65]
hemodynamically stable:
bradycardia associated with
neurologic disorders
1st consider permanent pacing
» Bradycardia can be acute (e.g., Cushing
reflex) or chronic. In many situations, the
bradycardia may be transient. First, identify and
eliminate reversible causes. Watchful waiting
for spontaneous resolutions is reasonable.

MANAGEMENT
Acute
Permanent pacing may be needed in a small
proportion of patients.
» In patients with epilepsy associated with
severe symptomatic bradycardia (ictal
bradycardia) that are not controlled with anti-
epileptic medications, permanent pacing is a
reasonable treatment option for reducing the
severity of symptoms.[11]
» Patients diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy
type 1 or Kearns-Sayre syndrome, who have
evidence of second-degree atrioventricular (AV)
block, third-degree AV block, or an abnormal
electrophysiology study (H-V interval of ≥70
ms), should be referred for pacemaker (or
implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] if there
is concomitant systolic dysfunction) implantation
regardless of symptoms, if meaningful survival of
more than 1 year is expected.[11]
» Patients with traumatic spinal cord injury
(above the sixth thoracic vertebra level) can have
episodes of profound bradycardia in response
to painful or noxious stimuli. These episodes
usually resolve over time and with elimination of
noxious stimuli, and conservative measures and
watchful waiting for resolution of symptomatic
bradycardia is preferable.[11]

Bradycardia Management
Emerging
Alternative pacing systems
Leadless pacemakers are a useful alternative to conventional pacing systems for single-chamber right
ventricular pacing. These devices are useful in patients who have an indication for single-chamber pacing
(e.g., patients with persistent atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response or pauses) in whom there is
a low anticipated pacing burden and there is no clinical need to ensure atrio-ventricular synchrony during
pacing.[41] However, recent advances in leadless pacemakers now allow for atrial synchronous ventricular
pacing with a single device or atrioventricular sequential pacing with a right atrial leadless device and a right
ventricular leadless device that can work together.[71] Conduction system pacing, is an evolving form of
permanent pacing that is being utilized in many clinical situations in which expected pacing burden is high
and avoidance of the adverse effects of chronic right ventricular pacing is preferred. However, emergent
data point to use of left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) as being of similar benefit, easier to implant and
with better and lower long-term pacing thresholds.[71][72] More clinical studies are needed to identify which
subgroups of patients with bradycardia would benefit the most from these technologies.
Secondary prevention
Regular evaluation and examinations are necessary. Patient reporting of suspicious symptoms is the best
way to diagnose problems with bradycardia and to correlate them with symptoms. Patients should guide
practitioners regarding their symptoms and medications that may be associated with bradycardia.[20] In
patients ages ≥70 years, caution and careful monitoring should be applied when initiating or altering the dose
of rate control medication to avoid drug-related bradycardia.[21]
Patient discussions
Patients should be instructed to monitor heart rate and symptoms. It may be helpful for the patient to
keep a symptom diary to record heart rate and blood pressure when symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients
with bradycardia may monitor themselves as outpatients and notify their doctors only when they develop
cardinal symptoms, such as dizziness, syncope, or exercise intolerance, or symptoms suggestive of
congestive heart failure, so that therapy may be planned accordingly. For symptomatic patients who may
require a pacemaker, shared decision making between the patient and provider should be performed in
order to discuss the relative risks and benefits of pacemaker placement, and ensure that a pacemaker
will be congruent with the patient's goals of care, values, and preferences. For patients with a pacemaker,
scheduled follow-up care is needed. Patients must check the pacemaker pocket site for bleeding and
infection and notify their doctor immediately if these occur. Batteries may last between 5 and 10 years.

Bradycardia Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Asymptomatic patients
• Do not need regular follow-up. May monitor themselves as outpatients and notify their doctors only
when they develop cardinal symptoms.
Symptomatic
• Symptomatic patients should be seen by a physician, preferably a cardiologist, as soon as possible,
with appropriate testing undertaken to establish the degree and mechanism of bradycardia and
whether symptoms are secondary to the rhythm.
• Follow-up at this point depends on the type of diagnostic modality used. For example, if the patient
has an event monitor, the follow-up should happen at the end of 30 days or before this if a patient
transmission demonstrates a concerning rhythm correlating with symptoms.
• Similarly, if a patient has an implantable-loop recorder, he or she should be followed up if a
symptomatic episode occurred that caused the patient to activate the device. Routine follow-up in
patients with implantable-loop recorders can be every 3-6 months for the battery life of the device
(i.e., usually 18-24 months).
Pacemaker implantation
• A cardiologist, preferably an electrophysiologist, must follow patients after a pacemaker has been
implanted.
• The initial follow-up should be 1 week after implant to assess the pocket and incision site for
possible infection.
• 2-month follow-up must occur after pacemaker implantation and then yearly thereafter.
• The reason for frequent yearly follow-up is to assess the device for lead function and battery life,
and to review any events that were recorded by the device.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
syncope variable high
A common complication. Patients who experience syncope with bradycardia benefit from an implantable
pacemaker to regulate the heart rhythm.
congestive heart failure variable high
Some patients with longstanding bradycardia may develop symptoms of heart failure owing to decreased
cardiac output. Heart failure should be managed as for heart failure in any other condition.
arrhythmias variable high
With complete heart block, patients may develop polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
fibrillation, which can cause sudden cardiac death.

Bradycardia Follow up
Prognosis
Bradycardia may be an acute or chronic problem depending upon the etiology. It may resolve and never
recur if the inciting event is treated or removed (e.g., hypothyroidism, electrolyte derangements, or
medications). However, for patients with an underlying conduction system disease, bradycardia will require
frequent follow-up, with long-term and sometimes lifelong therapy for those with a pacemaker. The prognosis
for patients who are symptomatic from bradycardia is poor if they are not treated with a pacemaker.
Treatment with a pacemaker produces an excellent prognosis in these patients.

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
