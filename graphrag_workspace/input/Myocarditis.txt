Myocarditis Overview
Summary
Myocarditis describes a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by myocardial inflammation in the
absence of predominant acute or chronic ischemia.
Can affect all age groups with an apparent slightly higher incidence in males than females and equal
incidence in black people and white people.
May present as fulminant, acute, or chronic myocarditis.
Treatment is usually supportive care and conventional heart failure therapy. More severe presentations may
need aggressive pharmacologic treatment with escalation to mechanical circulatory support. Occasionally,
certain cases do not respond to conventional therapy and progress to heart transplantation or death.
Prognosis is variable but is related to presentation and underlying etiology. Most cases of viral myocarditis
are asymptomatic and spontaneously resolve. Patients who present with mild to moderate heart failure tend
to improve or recover but may progress to chronic severe heart failure. Surprisingly, patients who present
with fulminant, acutely decompensated heart failure almost universally recover back to baseline function, if
death is prevented through management in the acute phase.
Definition
Myocarditis is clinically and pathologically defined as inflammation of the myocardium in the absence of the
predominant acute or chronic ischemia characteristic of coronary artery disease. It is a clinical syndrome
of nonischemic myocardial inflammation resulting from a heterogeneous group of infectious, immune, and
nonimmune diseases. Histopathologically, it is characterized by an inflammatory cellular infiltrate with or
without evidence of myocyte injury.[1]

Myocarditis Theory
Epidemiology
The extreme variability of clinical manifestations and frequently insidious onset of symptoms makes the
true incidence and prevalence of myocarditis difficult to determine. Autopsy studies reveal myocarditis in
1% to 9% of routine postmortem exams, and a prospective postmortem study of sudden cardiac death in
young adults suggests myocarditis as the etiology in approximately 10% of cases.[19] [20] [21] Additionally,
a large prospective trial of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy revealed myocarditis as the etiology in 9% of
patients.[22]
A Finnish study in children ages ≤15 years estimated the annual incidence of myocarditis to be approximately
2 cases per 100,000 children.[23] In a retrospective US study of 212 children, 46% of myocarditis cases were
in those ages 13-18 years, with a median age of 13.1 years.[24] A slightly greater number of cases were in
males (58%) than in females (42%).[24] Female sex and younger age appeared to correlate with a worse
clinical presentation and prognosis.[24]
Etiology
In the majority of patients with myocarditis, there is no identified cause and the case is classified as
idiopathic or undefined cause. In those with an identified cause, common etiologies may be infectious or
noninfectious.[4] [5][25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35]

Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of myocarditis is not entirely clear. However, in viral-mediated myocarditis, animal models
have implicated three significant mechanisms:[25] [36]
• An infectious organism directly invades the myocardium
• Local and systemic immunologic activation quickly ensues

Myocarditis Theory
THEORY
• Cellular (CD4+) and humoral (B-cell clonal multiplication) activation occurs, causing worsening local
inflammation, antiheart antibody production, and further myonecrosis.
All three may occur in the same host. However, the predominant pathway may differ depending on the
individual characteristics of the infectious species, the innate defenses of the host organism, and potentially
genetic predilections. The “two-hit” hypothesis suggests that patients with genetic mutations may be
predisposed to developing myocarditis upon exposure to certain factors, such as infectious agents. This
theory is supported by clinical studies in both children and adults.[37] [38] [39] However, more studies are
needed.
The first phase of viral-mediated myocarditis is characterized by viremia in the host organism. During this
time, the cardiotropic RNA virus enters the host myocyte via receptor-mediated endocytosis.[40] [41] Here,
the viral RNA is translated into viral protein, and the viral genome is incorporated into the host-cell DNA
as double-stranded RNA. This latter mechanism has been shown to cleave dystrophin, which is thought to
directly cause myocyte dysfunction.
During the second and third phases, macrophages, natural killer cells, and other inflammatory cells infiltrate
the myocardium. Once in the myocardium, these cells express inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1,
interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).[42] This results in increased cytokine
production and causes endothelial cell activation resulting in further infiltration of inflammatory cells. TNF
alone also acts as a negative inotrope.[43] In addition, autoantibodies directed against myocardial contractile
and structural proteins are produced. This is thought to have cytopathic effects on energy metabolism,
calcium homeostasis, and signal transduction, and also to cause complement activation resulting in the lysis
of myocytes.[44]
Other etiologies can trigger the inflammatory response via various pathways leading to myocardial
inflammation, infiltration, and injury.

Myocarditis Theory
Clinicopathologic classification[2]
• Fulminant myocarditis: presentation with acute illness following a distinct viral syndrome. Histologic
study reveals multiple foci of active myocarditis. Clinical presentation consists of severe cardiovascular
compromise and ventricular dysfunction. This subgroup has an extremely high risk for severe disease,
rapid deterioration, and sudden death. However, if supported well, including with mechanical support,
there is a good chance of recovery.
• Acute myocarditis: presentation with insidious onset of illness and evidence of established ventricular
dysfunction. This subgroup may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy.
• Chronic active myocarditis: presentation with insidious onset of illness with clinical and histologic
relapses with development of left ventricular dysfunction and associated chronic recurrent
inflammatory changes.
• Chronic persistent myocarditis: presentation with insidious onset of illness characterized by a
persistent histologic infiltrate frequently with foci of myocyte necrosis. Clinically, no ventricular
dysfunction is present despite other cardiovascular symptoms (such as palpitations or chest pain).
Important variants
Lymphocytic (viral) myocarditis
• The most common cause of myocarditis in the US, it is characterized by myocardial infiltrate with
lymphocytes as the predominant inflammatory cell.[3] [4] [5] [6]
Chagas heart disease
• Although exceedingly rare in the US,  Trypanosoma cruzi  infection-associated myocarditis is the most
common cause of heart failure in the world.[7]
• Histopathologically characterized by a predominantly lymphocytic cellular myocardial infiltrate in the
setting of a known history of  T cruzi  infection. Using specialized sensitive immunohistochemical
techniques and polymerase chain reaction amplification methods, parasitic antigens can be found by
endomyocardial biopsy.[8]
Giant cell myocarditis
• A rare and frequently fatal inflammatory disorder of cardiac muscle histologically characterized by:
• Inflammatory infiltrate with the presence of multinucleated giant cells
• Widespread degeneration and necrosis of myocardial fibers
• Absence of granulomas (to distinguish from cardiac sarcoidosis).
• Despite partial improvement to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, the prognosis is poor but
improves significantly with cardiac transplantation.[9] [10]
Hypersensitivity myocarditis
• A form of autoimmune myocardial inflammation that is often drug related and clinically presents with
acute rash, fever, and peripheral eosinophilia.[11] Histologically, it is most often characterized by a
myocardial interstitial infiltrate with prominent eosinophils but little myocyte necrosis.[12]
Viral myocarditis with ventricular arrhythmia
• Polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia without giant cell myocarditis at presentation can occur in viral
myocarditis patients and may represent ongoing systemic infection, whereas monomorphic ventricular
arrhythmia may suggest a chronic cardiomyopathic process with poor long-term outcomes.[13] [14]

Case history
Case history #1
A 43-year-old man with no significant medical history presents with 3 days of progressive fatigue, dyspnea
on exertion and while lying in the supine position, and lower extremity swelling. He reports having a flu-
like illness consisting of fevers, myalgias, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms 2 weeks prior that resolved
spontaneously. On examination the patient has an elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral pulmonary
rales, and a heart rate of 104 bpm with an audible left ventricular S3 gallop. He is mildly dyspneic at rest
but becomes markedly dyspneic with minimal exertion.
Case history #2
A 4-year-old child with a 4-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and low-grade fever presents to the
emergency room with lethargy. His parents report that prior to this illness, he was a completely healthy
child with an excellent energy level. On exam, the patient has resting tachycardia of 130 bpm, has labored
breathing, poor tone, poor capillary refill, and is very lethargic. He has S3 gallop and an early systolic
murmur. Mild crackles throughout the lung fields are noted.
Other presentations
The clinical manifestation of myocarditis is highly variable and ranges from asymptomatic ECG
abnormalities to cardiogenic shock.[5][15] When cardiac involvement manifests clinically, it typically
occurs 7-10 days after a systemic illness. Chest pain occurs in 35% of patients and may be typical,
atypical, or positional in nature.[4] [16] Occasionally, patients present with ischemic-sounding chest pain
and ST-segment elevations on ECG that mimic acute coronary syndrome. Left ventricular dysfunction
tends to be global instead of regional, and coronary angiography is normal.[17] Patients with myocarditis
may present with sudden cardiac death, usually due to ventricular arrhythmias; myocarditis has been
identified in up to 6% of young athletes with sudden cardiac death in the US.[18] 
It is important to remember that in children, myocarditis will often mimic common childhood illnesses with
symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, cough, and poor appetite. Respiratory symptoms
are often late in their presentation. Children may also present with decreased activity level as the only
persistent finding after a bout of viral prodrome. Thus, having a high index of suspicion is key in pediatric
myocarditis.

Myocarditis Diagnosis
Approach
The gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of myocarditis is the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).
However, this test has a yield of 10% to 20% and is not indicated for most patients with suspected
myocarditis.[4] [55] Thus, the appropriate evaluation of patients with suspected myocarditis begins with a
complete history and physical exam. If myocarditis is still suspected, then further workup with a 12-lead
ECG, laboratory evaluation of cardiac biomarkers, and two-dimensional echo should be performed.[16]
[21][56] There is no general consensus on which patients should undergo EMB; local guidelines should be
consulted.[5] [55] [57] [58] [59] Contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been
shown to assist in the diagnosis of myocarditis by providing detailed tissue characterization.[16] [21][56] [60]
 Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), especially 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
PET-CT, can also be of value.[21]
The approach may be modified for children with suspected myocarditis. The 2021 American Heart
Association (AHA) statement on pediatric myocarditis lays out a new paradigm for myocarditis based on
diagnostic strata and also provides guidance on approach.[15] The AHA statement classifies myocarditis as
1) biopsy proven, 2) cardiac MRI confirmed, 3) clinically suspected, and 4) possible myocarditis.[15] Thus,
when possible and safe, EMB continues to be the reference standard for diagnosis of confirmed myocarditis
in children. In the absence of biopsy, clinical diagnosis with or without MRI will provide necessary information
for the diagnosis.[15]
History
Patients presenting with myocarditis are usually under the age of 50 years. A history of viral prodrome 2-3
weeks prior to the onset of myocarditis is commonly present. Symptoms may include chest pain, dyspnea,
orthopnea, syncope, fatigue, and palpitations.[16]
In children, a viral prodrome will be the most common history, followed by history suggestive of
arrhythmias or syncope.[15] The common symptoms include fever, fatigue, respiratory symptoms,
abdominal pain, emesis, and lethargy.[15]
The patient's medical history may be significant for autoimmune disease such as collagen-vascular
diseases as well as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, thyrotoxicosis,
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), or Loeffler syndrome. In
addition, a history of travel to endemic areas where causative organisms are found may suggest a specific
infectious etiology.
A thorough medication history along with other possible exposures to toxic substances or cocaine should
be obtained to exclude any drug or toxic etiologies. These include anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin,
daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin), fluoropyrimidines (e.g., fluorouracil, capecitabine), immunotherapies
(e.g., ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, atezolizumab, avelumab,
durvalumab, and trastuzumab), arsenic, zidovudine, carbon monoxide, ethanol, iron, interleukin-2,
cocaine, amphetamine, smallpox or mpox vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine (may
occur with other types of COVID-19 vaccines), catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine,
dopamine), cyclophosphamide, heavy metals (copper, iron, lead), radiation, antibiotics (penicillins,
cephalosporins, sulfonamides), amphotericin B, thiazide diuretics, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine,
phenytoin, phenobarbital), digoxin, lithium, amitriptyline, clozapine, snake venom, bee venom, black
widow spider venom, scorpion venom, and wasp venom.

Myocarditis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Physical exam
A thorough examination for both the cardiorespiratory findings and other general findings that may point
to possible etiology should be performed. Findings can include rales, elevated neck veins, S3 gallop,
S3 and S4 summation gallop, pericardial friction rub, peripheral hypoperfusion, sinus tachycardia, atrial
and ventricular arrhythmias, hypotension, altered sensorium, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.
Resting tachycardia is an especially important sign in adolescents where the symptoms can be masked
significantly in both acute and chronic myocarditis.
12-lead ECG
A 12-lead ECG should be ordered immediately on presentation in anyone with chest pain or cardiac
symptoms.[15] [16] In myocarditis it most commonly displays nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave
abnormalities; however, ST-segment elevation and depression frequently occur. Children can present
with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and such a presentation can be a marker of poor outcomes.[61] A
component of pericarditis is common in children and can be evident as nonspecific ST-segment changes
in all of the precordial leads.
Laboratory evaluation
Cardiac biomarkers should be ordered immediately in any patient with suspected myocarditis. Creatine
kinase and creatine kinase-MB levels are often mildly elevated. Troponin (I or T) levels have shown to be
a more reliable indicator of myocardial damage, including in children.[15] [16]
Serum B-type natriuretic peptide may be helpful in distinguishing primary cardiac from primary pulmonary
etiologies of dyspnea when the physical exam and initial work-up is unclear or nonspecific. In myocarditis
it is elevated in response to ventricular distention such as occurs in congestive heart failure.[57]
Two-dimensional echocardiogram
This should be ordered in every patient suspected of having myocarditis.[15] [16] [56] Myocarditis can
cause global and regional left ventricular motion abnormalities, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and
dilatation.

 Special attention should be paid to evaluation for clots which can change therapies and risk profile.
Development of intracardiac thrombosis can occur due to a prothrombotic, proinflammatory state as well
as stagnant blood in the dysfunctional heart.[62]
Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB)
The potential risks and benefits of EMB should always be carefully assessed, particularly during the acute
presentation, as the risk of arrhythmia or ventricular perforation is highest at this time. There is no general
consensus on which patients should undergo EMB; recommendations vary and local guidelines should be
consulted.[5] [55] [57] [58][59][63][64]
A statement on dilated cardiomyopathies from the AHA recommends biopsy "in those patients with
clinically suspected unexplained acute myocarditis who require inotropic support or mechanical circulatory
support and those with Mobitz type 2 second-degree or higher heart block, sustained or symptomatic
ventricular tachycardia, or failure to respond to guideline-based medical management within 1-2
weeks".[55] The 2022 AHA/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA)
heart failure (HF) guidelines state "Endomyocardial biopsy may be advantageous in patients with heart
failure in which a histological diagnosis, such as myocarditis, may influence treatment decisions".[57]
 A joint statement from Heart Failure Association of European Society of Cardiology (ESC), HFSA,
and Japanese HF Society recommends EMB “in patients with fulminant/acute myocarditis presenting
with cardiogenic shock or acute HF and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, with or without malignant
ventricular arrhythmias and/or conduction abnormalities”. They also recommend considering EMB in
“hemodynamically stable patients with clinical symptoms and diagnostic criteria (electrocardiographic

In children, AHA guidelines continue to mark biopsies as the reference test for myocarditis diagnosis.[15]
It is important to note that with immunohistochemistry, the ability to assess for inflammatory cells has
greatly increased. Additionally, the biopsies can be used for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
to diagnose viral myocarditis with specificity, and to analyze immune-mediated injury and potentially
inflammatory markers at a molecular level.[65]
Cardiac MRI
Cardiac MRI is as an important tool in the assessment of suspected myocarditis, particularly when trying
to distinguish acute myocarditis from acute MI.[16] [56] [60] In some cases, findings from cardiac MRI can
also be useful in determining the etiology of myocarditis.[66]

Myocarditis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Lake Louise consensus criteria were updated in 2018 to propose that presence of both T2 and T1 findings
provide strong evidence for myocardial inflammation.[67]
In children, the primary purpose of cardiac MRI is to identify myocardial injury, and to differentiate acute
myocarditis from non-inflammatory cardiomyopathies.[15]
Other tests
• Coronary angiography: this should be performed when the presenting symptoms and findings are
indistinguishable from the acute coronary syndromes.
• FDG PET-CT: helps diagnose myocarditis by providing metabolic information of inflammation as
increased FDG uptake. The role of 18F-FDG PET-CT is useful in chronic myocarditis, where CMR
does not have the same accuracy as in acute myocarditis.[68]
• MRI-guided EMB: this is a promising new technology that appears to significantly increase the
sensitivity of EMB in the diagnosis of myocarditis.[69] This is still in the developmental phase and
requires validation in larger studies.

Myocarditis Diagnosis
infection (non-HIV)
• Many viral, bacterial, and fungal infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
myocarditis.[25] [33] The most common cause of myocarditis worldwide is  Trypanosoma cruzi  with an
estimated 18 million people infected.[7] In the US, adenoviruses and enteroviruses, such as Coxsackie
B, are believed to be the predominant cause.[45] In Germany, parvovirus B19 is the organism most
prevalently isolated from endomyocardial biopsy, while in Japan, hepatitis C virus is most commonly
implicated.[46] [47] Case reports have implicated SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential etiologic agent
during the COVID-19 pandemic.[29]
HIV infection
• HIV disease places a person at very high risk of developing myocarditis. In a postmortem study of
patients with AIDS, 67% were found to have biopsy-confirmed myocarditis.[46] Also, prospective data
suggest that the yearly incidence of developing myocarditis is 1.6% in asymptomatic HIV-positive
patients; this incidence increases among patients with CD4 counts below 400 cells/mm³.[47]
autoimmune/immune-mediated diseases
• systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and other immune-mediated diseases such as
sarcoidosis place patients at markedly increased risk of developing myocarditis.[48] [49] [50]
peripartum and postpartum periods
• There is a strong association between women in the peripartum or postpartum period and the
development of myocarditis.[4] [51]
Weak
drugs and toxins
• Hypersensitivity myocarditis is associated with many medications.[30] [31] [32] [52] [53] [54]
• Drugs and toxic exposures that are known to cause myocarditis include anthracyclines (e.g.,
doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin), fluoropyrimidines (e.g., fluorouracil, capecitabine),
immunotherapies (e.g., ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, cemiplimab,
atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, and trastuzumab), arsenic, zidovudine, carbon monoxide,
ethanol, iron, interleukin-2, cocaine, amphetamine, smallpox or mpox vaccine, SARS-CoV-2
(COVID-19) mRNA vaccine (may occur with other types of COVID-19 vaccines), catecholamines
(e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine), cyclophosphamide, heavy metals (copper, iron, lead),
radiation, antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides), amphotericin B, thiazide diuretics,
anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), digoxin, lithium, amitriptyline, clozapine,

endomyocardial biopsy (EMB)
• There is no general consensus on which adult patients should
undergo EMB; recommendations vary and local guidelines should
be consulted.[5] [55][57] [58] [59] [63][64] A statement on dilated
cardiomyopathies from the American Heart Association (AHA)
recommends biopsy "in those patients with clinically suspected
unexplained acute myocarditis who require inotropic support or
mechanical circulatory support and those with Mobitz type 2 second-
degree or higher heart block, sustained or symptomatic ventricular
tachycardia, or failure to respond to guideline-based medical
management within 1-2 weeks".[55] The 2022 AHA/American College
of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) heart failure
(HF) guidelines state "endomyocardial biopsy may be advantageous
in patients with heart failure in which a histological diagnosis,
such as myocarditis, may influence treatment decisions".[57]
A joint statement from Heart Failure Association of European
Society of Cardiology (ESC), HFSA, and Japanese HF Society
recommends EMB “in patients with fulminant/acute myocarditis
presenting with cardiogenic shock or acute HF and left ventricular
(LV) dysfunction, with or without malignant ventricular arrhythmias
and/or conduction abnormalities”. They also recommend considering
EMB in “hemodynamically stable patients with clinical symptoms
and diagnostic criteria (electrocardiographic abnormalities, elevated
troponin levels, and imaging findings) suggestive of myocarditis, in
the absence of significant coronary artery disease".[59]
• The potential risks and benefits of EMB should always be carefully
assessed, particularly during the acute presentation, as the risk of
arrhythmia or ventricular perforation is highest at this time.

reference test for myocarditis diagnosis.[15] It is important to note
that with immunohistochemistry, the ability to assess for inflammatory
cells has greatly increased. Additionally, the biopsies can be used
for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to diagnose viral
myocarditis with specificity, and to analyze immune-mediated injury

Myocarditis Diagnosis
Differentials
Condition Differentiating signs /
symptoms
Differentiating tests
Acute coronary syndrome • Patients presenting with
myocardial infarction tend to
be older and have traditional
risk factors for coronary
atherosclerosis when
compared with patients with
myocarditis.
• Left heart catheterization
should reveal significant
coronary atherosclerotic
disease.
Dilated cardiomyopathy • There can be considerable
overlap between dilated
cardiomyopathy and
myocarditis. As many
as 16% of patients
presenting with acute
dilated cardiomyopathy who
undergo endomyocardial
biopsy are found to
have biopsy-confirmed
myocarditis.[70]
• A family history of dilated
cardiomyopathy, a known
history of exposure to a
direct cardiotoxin (e.g.,
ethanol), or the absence
of elevations of markers
of myocardial injury make
myocarditis less likely.
• The presence of an
inflammatory infiltrate of the
myocardium with necrosis
and/or degeneration of
adjacent myocytes not
typical of the ischemic
damage associated with
coronary artery disease is
diagnostic for myocarditis.
However, the lack of these
findings does not exclude
myocarditis.
Pericarditis • It can be difficult, if not
impossible, to distinguish
patients presenting with
pericarditis from those with
myocarditis based on history
and physical exam alone.
• Both syndromes can exhibit
typical or positional chest
pain, and both are commonly
preceded by a fever and/or a
viral syndrome.
• The presence of signs or
symptoms of heart failure
suggests myocarditis as
the etiology, as isolated
pericarditis does not
impair left ventricular (LV)
function.[16]
• Two-dimensional echo can
be used to help differentiate
these conditions. The
presence of LV dysfunction
(systolic or diastolic)
implicates myocarditis as the
etiology.
Stress-induced
cardiomyopathy
(broken heart
syndrome, Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy)
• Patients with stress-induced
cardiomyopathy can present
similarly to those with acute
myocarditis.
• No specific test will
distinguish stress-induced
cardiomyopathy from
myocarditis.

disease.
• Borderline myocarditis: the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium without necrosis
or degeneration of adjacent myocytes.
World Health Organization Marburg Classification[73]
First biopsy:
• Acute (active) myocarditis: a clear-cut infiltrate (diffuse, focal, or confluent) of >14 leukocytes/
mm² (preferably activated T cells). The amount of the infiltrate should be quantified by
immunohistochemistry. Necrosis or degeneration is compulsory; fibrosis may be absent or present and
should be graded
• Chronic myocarditis: an infiltrate of >14 leukocytes/mm² (diffuse, focal, or confluent, preferably
activated T cells). Quantification should be made by immunohistochemistry. Necrosis or degeneration
is usually not evident; fibrosis may be absent or present and should be graded
• No myocarditis: No infiltrating cells or <14 leukocytes/mm².
Subsequent biopsies:
• Ongoing (persistent) myocarditis. Criteria as in acute or chronic myocarditis
• Resolving (healing) myocarditis. Criteria as in acute or chronic myocarditis, but the immunologic
process is sparser than in the first biopsy
• Resolved (healed) myocarditis. Corresponds to the Dallas classification.
The amount and distribution of fibrosis should be described similarly as no (grade 0), mild (grade 1),
moderate (grade 2), or severe (grade 3). Localization or formation of fibrosis should be outlined as
endocardial, replacement, or interstitial.

Myocarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The mainstay of therapy for myocarditis is supportive care and conventional heart failure therapy.[15] [55]
[57] [58][75] There can be considerable overlap between dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis; as many
as 16% of patients presenting with acute dilated cardiomyopathy who undergo endomyocardial biopsy are
found to have biopsy-confirmed myocarditis.[70] Treatment is therefore aimed at management of both the
cardiomyopathy and myocarditis in those patients with concomitant cardiomyopathy.[76] 
Hemodynamically unstable with or without cardiogenic shock
A small proportion of patients with acute myocarditis will present with fulminant heart failure, sustained
ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring and aggressive
pharmacologic therapy.[21] A pulmonary artery catheter may be inserted to help optimize cardiac filling
pressures and for rapid titration of cardiovascular therapies. Pharmacologic therapy for adults may include
vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside, vasopressors such as norepinephrine, and inotropes such
as dobutamine.[77] An intra-aortic balloon pump or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) may be required
as a bridge to recovery or heart transplantation.[57] [78] In children, inotropic support may be provided
by milrinone or dobutamine, with early escalation to mechanical circulatory support (such as LVAD or
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) if required.[15]
Hemodynamically stable with left ventricular (LV) systolic
dysfunction
An ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, or sacubitril/valsartan should be started as early
as possible. A sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor is recommended once the patient is
stable. Diuretic therapy, vasodilators, and inotropes are used in both the acute and chronic setting with the
goal of optimizing intracardiac filling pressures and increasing cardiac output. Long-term anticoagulation
therapy may be needed to reduce risk of stroke or other arterial embolism. Patients with LV dysfunction
should avoid exercise.[21]
ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, or sacubitril/valsartan:
• In addition to the confirmed efficacy in chronic heart failure, animal studies suggest that when
started early in the course of acute myocarditis, renin-angiotensin antagonists improve survival and
inhibit progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.[79]
• The efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan for the treatment of heart failure has been well documented, and
may be superior to ACE inhibitors, although data specifically for myocarditis are lacking. Sacubitril
is a neprilysin inhibitor.[80]
SGLT2 inhibitor:
• SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for adults who have been hospitalized with heart failure,
once they are clinically stable.[81] SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in adults with symptomatic
chronic heart failure, regardless of the presence of diabetes, to reduce cardiovascular mortality and
hospitalization for heart failure.[57] [82]
• Preclinical studies suggest an anti-inflammatory role for SGLT2 inhibitors in myocarditis.[83] [84]
Vasodilator or inotrope:
• Oral arterial (hydralazine) and venous (nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate) vasodilators acutely
improve cardiac output and decrease pulmonary and LV filling pressures.[77] This combination of

Myocarditis Management
therapy may also reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure who cannot tolerate
ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, or sacubitril/valsartan.[57]
• Oral hydralazine and nitrates are rarely used in pediatric care. If vasodilators are required in
children, ACE inhibitors and related agents are often most appropriate.
• Milrinone (a parenteral positive inotrope and vasodilator) is often used early in the treatment course
in children with evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, even if they are hemodynamically
stable. Milrinone may cause hypotension or, rarely, ventricular arrhythmias.
Beta-blocker:
• Similarly, beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol, metoprolol, bisoprolol) should be started once the patient
is no longer in acutely decompensated heart failure
• In animal models of acute myocarditis, the early initiation of beta-adrenergic blockers has been
shown to reduce myocardial inflammation.[85] [86]
• Carvedilol is often the preferred beta-blocker in children.
Aldosterone antagonist:
• An aldosterone antagonist (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone) should be started in patients with New
York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure.[57]
• Eplerenone is not recommended in children.
Diuretic:
• Diuretics improve hemodynamics and patient comfort.[57]
• Volume status should be monitored.
• Dual therapy with a thiazide (or thiazide-like) diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide,
metolazone) and a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide) may be required in some patients for augmented
therapeutic effect.[57] The thiazide diuretic should be administered at the same time as or 30
minutes prior to the loop diuretic.
Anticoagulant:
• Patients with left ventricular anteroapical akinesis or aneurysm as a result of cardiomyopathy
are at increased risk for stroke or other arterial embolism secondary to left ventricular thrombus
formation.[57]
• Warfarin is appropriate to reduce risk in both children and adults.
Immunosuppressive therapies and intravenous immune globulin
(IVIG)
Because the long-term myocardial changes associated with myocarditis appear to be mediated by
abnormal cellular and humoral immune activation, it is hypothesized that immunosuppression should
be an effective form of treatment. Despite this rationale, immune suppression trials aimed at attenuating
the inflammatory response in myocarditis in adults have been largely disappointing. Well-designed
prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving immune suppression with corticosteroids with
or without cyclosporine or azathioprine for the treatment of biopsy-confirmed myocarditis showed no long-
term improvement in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) or survival benefit.[87] [88]
Similarly, the use of IVIG for treatment of acute myocarditis has been evaluated in several small studies.
An RCT of patients with newly diagnosed acute dilated cardiomyopathy found no benefit in mortality or
improvement in LVEF in those treated with IVIG as compared with standard care.[89] This lack of benefit
persisted in those patients with biopsy-confirmed myocarditis. A Cochrane review evaluating IVIG for
presumed viral myocarditis in children and adults could not draw certain conclusions about its efficacy

due to paucity of data.[90] Compared to adults, IVIG is used very frequently in pediatric patients with
myocarditis. In one multicenter study, IVIG was used as a therapeutic agent in 51% of children admitted
with mild cardiac dysfunction, and in 88% of those admitted with moderate or worse function.[24]
Overall, standard immunosuppressive regimens and IVIG cannot be recommended for the routine
treatment of myocarditis due to lack of robust evidence. The decision to use them or not should be
determined on a case-by-case basis. Exceptions to this include patients with giant cell myocarditis or
myocarditis secondary to autoimmune diseases; both of these patient populations have been shown to
benefit from aggressive early immune suppression.[33][91]
Therapy targeted at specific cause of myocarditis
Lymphocytic (viral) myocarditis
• Lymphocytic myocarditis is primarily treated with supportive care and standard heart failure
therapies. As with all etiologies of myocarditis, patients presenting with fulminant heart failure
and cardiogenic shock may require invasive hemodynamic monitoring, aggressive therapy with
intravenous diuretics or inotropes, and even mechanical hemodynamic support devices. Given the
high rate of recovery, aggressive therapy is recommended, especially early in the course of the
disease.
• For the most part, immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to be ineffective in viral
myocarditis.[92] There are insufficient data to support a benefit of intravenous gamma globulin.[90]
Novel therapies with immune-modulating drugs such as interferon-beta have shown great promise
in phase II trials.[93]
• For those with documented influenza, antiviral agents may be beneficial. In those with SARS-
CoV-2 infection, similarly, antiviral agents as well as monoclonal antibodies may be used. For
more information on the treatment of influenza infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection, see Influenza
infection  and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) .
Giant cell myocarditis
• This is a rare and rapidly progressive disease that is probably the most fatal of all causes of
myocarditis.[9] Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias are seen in 14% of patients with giant cell
myocarditis at first presentation, progressing to refractory arrhythmias in more than half of the
patients.[21] Although aggressive immunosuppressive regimens have been shown to only modestly
improve survival, limited data suggest that it prolongs life sufficiently to enable more effective
treatment with heart transplantation.[10] [91] [94]
Autoimmune-related myocarditis
• Patients with myocarditis due to systemic autoimmune diseases generally have a significant
response to aggressive immunosuppressive regimens including systemic corticosteroids. Animal
studies with immune-modulating therapies such as rapamycin and mycophenolate mofetil are
promising.
Hypersensitivity myocarditis
• Hypersensitivity myocarditis is thought to be related to an allergic reaction to a variety of drugs.
With the removal of the offending agent and treatment with systemic corticosteroids, clinical
improvement is the rule.[95]
Chagasic myocarditis

Myocarditis Management
• Chagas disease is the most common cause of myocarditis in the world. Patients with chagasic
myocarditis should be treated with an appropriate antiparasitic agent; see Chagas disease  for
detailed information on management. Heart failure treatment of this disease is mainly symptom
management. A permanent pacemaker with defibrillator is often necessary because of conduction
abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmias. Immunosuppressive therapy is controversial; heart
transplantation is often necessary for refractory heart failure.[33]
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related myocarditis[32]
• The ICI should be discontinued immediately and treatment with high-dose intravenous
methylprednisolone commenced. This can be switched to a weaning dose of oral prednisone
if patients show ongoing signs of clinical improvement. Corticosteroid-refractory patients or
hemodynamically unstable patients with fulminant myocarditis should be treated with second-
line immunosuppressive therapies. Various second-line agents are under investigation (e.g.,
mycophenolate, abatacept, IVIG) and specialist guidance is recommended. After recovery, a
multidisciplinary team should review whether ICI therapy should be restarted.

Myocarditis Management
Acute
» ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril, enalapril,
lisinopril) and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists
(e.g., candesartan, valsartan) improve
cardiac output and hemodynamics by arterial
vasodilation. Chronic maladaptive cardiac
remodeling is also attenuated.[57] Evidence
suggests that the likelihood of progression to
dilated cardiomyopathy is reduced with early
initiation.[79] These medications may precipitate
acute renal failure or hyperkalemia. Serum
potassium, BUN, and creatinine should be
monitored.
» The efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan for
the treatment of heart failure has been well
documented, and may be superior to ACE
inhibitors, although data specifically for
myocarditis are lacking. Sacubitril is a neprilysin

» Oral arterial vasodilators (e.g., hydralazine)
and venous vasodilators (nitrates such as
isosorbide dinitrate) acutely improve cardiac
output and decrease pulmonary and left
ventricular filling pressures.[77] This combination
of therapy may also reduce morbidity and
mortality in patients with heart failure who
cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II
receptor antagonists, or sacubitril/valsartan.[57]
Hydralazine should be used in conjunction with
a nitrate for the treatment of congestive heart
failure. Hydralazine and nitrates are rarely used
in pediatric care. If vasodilators are required in
children, ACE inhibitors and related agents are
often most appropriate. 
» Milrinone (a parenteral positive inotrope
and vasodilator) is often used early in the

in pulmonary vasculature and left ventricular
end-diastolic pressures.[77] This effect can
rapidly improve respiratory distress secondary

» Intravenous inotropes (e.g., dobutamine,
milrinone) can be considered in patients with
associated nonischemic cardiomyopathy in
whom end-organ hypoperfusion is secondary
to cardiogenic shock. In this situation, inotropes
increase cardiac index resulting in increased
end-organ perfusion. One randomized controlled
trial found no significant difference between
dobutamine and milrinone in terms of outcomes
including in-hospital death, resuscitated cardiac
arrest, and nonfatal myocardial infarction.[96]
Dobutamine and milrinone increase the risk of
ventricular arrhythmias. Also, both agents can
cause hypotension via their vascular effect and
thus worsen end-organ perfusion. Long-term
use of inotropes is associated with increased
mortality.[57]
» Vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine,
phenylephrine) can be used to elevate blood
pressure in hypotensive patients with systolic
dysfunction. Caution is required, as hypotension
in the setting of cardiomyopathy is frequently
caused by low cardiac output, which will be
worsened with the use of vasopressors. Invasive
hemodynamic monitoring with a Swan-Ganz
catheter can be used to discern the etiology
of hypotension and inform the decision to use
these agents. Use of vasopressors in the setting
of hypovolemia is associated with limb and
mesenteric ischemia, organ hypoperfusion,
and increased mortality. The volume status
of the patient must therefore be known to be
normal before the use of vasopressors can be

» Mechanical circulatory support with an intra-
aortic balloon pump (IABP) or left ventricular
assist device (LVAD [e.g., Impella®]) may be
indicated in patients with refractory cardiogenic
shock despite optimal aggressive medical
therapy. Both devices may be used as a
bridge to recovery or as a bridge to heart
transplantation if no response to treatment.[57]
» IABP markedly increases the risk of infection.
The patient should be frequently re-evaluated to
determine if IABP is still a necessity and remove
it as soon as deemed safe.
» IABP also increases the risk of limb ischemia.
The lower extremities must be regularly
examined and the IABP must be removed at the
first sign of arterial compromise.
» In addition, IABP increases the risk of arterial
thrombus. Heparin should be used in conjunction
with this therapy if not contraindicated.
» Patients should continue on their existing heart
failure medications along with the IABP.
» LAVDs are associated with moderate risk for
perioperative complication or mortality. They
also impart a high risk of serious bleeding
complication.[97]
» Driveline infections are the most common
LVAD-associated infection and require antibiotic
therapy.[98]
» LVADs also carry a high risk of arterial
thromboembolic disease. Most require long-term

adjunct mechanical circulatory support
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» For children with acute or fulminant myocarditis
who are demonstrating hemodynamic instability,
consideration may be given to early mechanical
circulatory support, as medical therapy
during this phase is often not adequate. This
is especially true if the patient is already
demonstrating arrhythmias.
» Depending on the age and size of the child,
and center preference, such circulatory support
may be provided by extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) or by a temporary
left ventricular assist device such as with
TandemHeart® or Impella®.
» ECMO is recommended for children
with cardiogenic shock, cardiorespiratory
compromise, or significant arrhythmias.[15]
Venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO), when used for
supporting pediatric myocarditis patients, has a
survival to hospital discharge of 76%.[99] This
is the best survival of any indication for pediatric
VA-ECMO.[99]
» A durable left ventricular assist device can
be used as a bridge to recovery or heart
transplantation if ECMO cannot be weaned.[15]

LVAD, patients are also able to choose LVAD
therapy instead of heart transplantation.

Emerging
Levosimendan
Levosimendan is an inodilator, meaning it provides inotropy with vasodilation. It has been licensed in Europe
since the 2000s for the short-term treatment of acutely decompensated severe chronic heart failure when
conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate.[101] It
is not approved for use in the US but remains under active clinical investigation.[101] Randomized controlled
trials in adults have shown that levosimendan improves clinical outcomes and is generally well tolerated.[102]
[103] Evidence of levosimendan improving mortality versus other inodilators such as dobutamine remains
conflicting.[104] [105] Levosimendan has also demonstrated efficacy in the pediatric population with an
acceptable safety profile. Results from a single-center retrospective study suggested that levosimendan
may reduce the need for mechanical circulatory support in children undergoing cardiac surgery or with
decompensated heart failure.[106] Other studies have shown that levosimendan has similar efficacy to or is
superior to milrinone in neonates and children.[107] [108] Despite these findings, robust clinical trial evidence
for levosimendan in pediatric patients remains lacking.[101] Levosimendan is being investigated for other
indications including pulmonary hypertension and septic shock.[109] It failed to demonstrate superiority to
placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[110]
Primary prevention
Very little is known regarding effective measures to prevent myocarditis. Current aims of primary prevention
are limited to preventing the development of a condition known to be associated with myocarditis. An
example is having safe-sex practices to prevent infection with HIV.
In cancer patients undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), serial ECGs and
troponin measurements should be taken to detect subclinical ICI-related cardiovascular toxicity. Broader
cardiovascular assessment should be considered every 6-12 months in patients who require long-term
treatment.[32]
Secondary prevention
Ethanol abstinence is encouraged in all patients with a history of myocarditis, although the effects of modest
alcohol consumption on nonalcohol-related cardiomyopathy are unknown. Avoidance of participation
in competitive sports for 3-6 months after a diagnosis of myocarditis is recommended, including in
children.[15] Avoidance of nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs is also recommended to limit the risk of increased
inflammation and mortality.[55] 
Patient discussions
Patient instruction depends on individual patient characteristics. Universal limitation of salt and water
intake for volume and blood pressure management is recommended for all patients with myocarditis.
Home blood pressure measurement and daily weight recordings with frequent communication with the
primary physician are ideal.

Myocarditis Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Recommended follow-up is dictated by the clinical course of the individual patient. Patients who exhibit
only mild symptoms with prompt resolution of symptoms should be followed closely initially, but monitoring
can be quickly spaced out to annual visits unless symptoms recur. However, patient with persistent left
ventricular (LV) dysfunction or evidence of progression of myocardial inflammation warrant regular follow-
up at least every few months or sooner until the patient is stable clinically.[55] [75]
In children, biopsy or cardiac MRI may be necessary if ventricular function, inflammatory biomarkers, or
viral activity continue to be abnormal at follow-up.[15]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atrial fibrillation long term medium
Often occurs in the setting of increased intra-atrial pressures and dilatation as a result of LV systolic and
diastolic dysfunction and mitral valve regurgitation.
ventricular tachyarrhythmias long term low
Most commonly associated with Chagas disease myocarditis but can be seen in all etiologies of
myocarditis.[8] Patients with symptomatic, recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias after myocarditis can be
treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. An implantable cardiac defibrillator can be considered for more severe
or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Catheter ablation can be an effective second-line option for
patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.[21]
dilated cardiomyopathy variable medium
Presumably occurs due to progression of the original disease process. Developed in 21% of patients with
acute myocarditis over a mean follow-up period of 3 years.[21] The patient should be treated with standard
heart failure therapies and referred to a heart failure specialist.
sudden cardiac death variable low
Usually caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.
Up to 12% of sudden cardiac deaths in young people are estimated to be related to myocarditis.[21]
multisystem organ failure variable low
Rarely occurs as a result of either acute presentation of fulminant heart failure or as the result of end-stage
heart failure secondary to chronic dilated cardiomyopathy.

Myocarditis Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Prognosis
Given the limitations in current methods of diagnosing myocarditis, it is not surprising that its natural
history and associated prognosis are as varied as its clinical presentations. A study looking at the
outcomes of patients presenting with acute myocarditis found no connection between clinical variables and
prognosis.[111] Despite this, multiple factors have been linked to a favorable or poorer outcome. A definite
association exists between the myocarditis-associated risk factor or specific type of myocarditis and the
prognosis of the patient.[5] Also, the severity of illness at presentation tends to correlate with long-term
outcome.
Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) DNA PCR persistence of
cardiotropic viral genome
The prognosis of patients in whom the EMB DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis is positive for a
cardiotropic viral genome has been studied. Those who have persistently positive viral genome analysis on
EMB demonstrate worsening left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and outcome when compared with those
who test negative on subsequent EMBs.[112]
Fulminant myocarditis
Patients who present with fulminant myocarditis surprisingly tend to have better outcomes than those who
present with a clinically milder acute myocarditis. An 11-year study of patients presenting with myocarditis
showed a 93% survival free of heart transplantation in patients with fulminant myocarditis as opposed to 45%
in patients who presented with acute myocarditis.[113]
Giant cell myocarditis
Despite modest improvement in mortality with immunosuppressive therapy, patients with giant cell
myocarditis have the worst outcomes with a median survival of 5.5 months from the onset of heart failure
symptoms.[91]
Presentation mimicking MI
Patients presenting with chest pain and ECG changes similar to those seen in ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction have almost uniform recovery without any residual cardiac dysfunction.[17]
Histologic resolution of myocardial inflammation
Patients with histologic resolution of myocardial cellular infiltration on repeat EMB tend to have improvement
in cardiac function and a favorable clinical outcome.[114]
Serum immunologic markers
Patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy and elevated levels of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
receptor-1 and fas at presentation have a worse clinical course and are more likely to not recover LV function
than those with lower levels.[115]
Cardiac MRI findings
A normal cardiac MRI indicates a favorable long-term prognosis, regardless of clinical and other findings.
Myocardial edema without fibrosis is also associated with a positive prognosis.[56]
Conversely, a significant amount of early and late gadolinium enhancement correlates with a poor
prognosis.[56]

Figure 1: Histologic findings in a patient with giant cell myocarditis. A: severe myocardial necrosis and
fibrotic replacement of the cardiomyocytes with granulation tissue and fibrosis is present in a section
from the anterolateral left ventricular wall; B: a sharp demarcating border between vital and necrotic
myocardium is seen, confirmed by additional immunohistochemical staining for myoglobin; C: at the
inflammatory border, cells consisting of prominent multinucleated giant cells, macrophages, lymphocytes,
and eosinophilic granulocytes are seen in close proximity to vital myocardium; D: immunohistochemical
staining for complement 4d is positive in all vessels, suggestive of complement cascade activation

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
