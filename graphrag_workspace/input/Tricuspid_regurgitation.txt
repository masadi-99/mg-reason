Tricuspid regurgitation Overview
Summary
Tricuspid regurgitation usually presents with fatigue, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. Additional
complaints may include abdominal distension and early satiety.
Mild or moderate tricuspid regurgitation without abnormal valve anatomy, ventricular function, or pulmonary
artery pressure is not necessarily abnormal but is estimated to be present in over 50% of asymptomatic
young adults.
The clinically most important form is secondary to left-sided cardiac disease, with tricuspid annular dilation.
The affected valve may be repaired or replaced; similar to mitral surgery, surgical repair is preferred over
replacement.
Operative risk for tricuspid valve surgery depends on the extent of right ventricular dysfunction and
concomitant disease. Reoperation for severe tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided valve surgery carries a
high risk. Therefore, correction of tricuspid regurgitation should be considered at the time of initial surgery.
The disease has largely been undertreated and its impact is under appreciated.
Definition
Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurs when blood flows backwards through the tricuspid valve. In the vast
majority of patients, this occurs during systole, but severely elevated right ventricular filling pressure can be
associated with diastolic TR. TR can be primary (abnormal valve morphology) or secondary (normal valve
morphology). Some degree of valvular regurgitation is a relatively common incidental finding in color Doppler
imaging. In fact, two-dimensional echocardiography has demonstrated that 50% to 60% of asymptomatic
young adults exhibit mild tricuspid regurgitation.[1] A smaller proportion, up to 15%, have moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

Epidemiology
Some degree of valvular regurgitation is a relatively common incidental finding in color Doppler imaging.
In fact, two-dimensional echocardiography has demonstrated that 50% to 60% of asymptomatic young
adults exhibit mild tricuspid regurgitation.[1] A smaller proportion, up to 15%, have moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. It is most often found secondary to, or in association with, left-sided cardiac pathology in
the form of advanced mitral, aortic, or left ventricular myocardial disorders. In developed countries, the
most commonly associated conditions include ischemic or degenerative mitral regurgitation; however, in
developing countries, the association is with rheumatic heart disease. Rarely does TR present as an isolated
disease process.
Etiology
TR occurs with abnormal (primary) or normal (secondary, functional) valve morphology. Causes of primary
valve dysfunction are uncommon, and include congenital etiologies such as cleft valve in association
with atrioventricular canal defect and Ebstein anomaly; acquired etiologies include rheumatic valvulitis,
endocarditis, or scarring from carcinoid heart disease.[6] Less commonly, TR occurs with rheumatoid
arthritis, Marfan syndrome, pacemaker lead entrapment, and tricuspid valve prolapse (sometimes in
association with myxomatous mitral valve disease), or following trauma (such as blunt force trauma or
repeated endomyocardial biopsies), radiation therapy, and toxin exposure (phentermine-fenfluramine [Phen-
Fen] or methysergide). The most clinically significant form of TR, however, is secondary in nature, commonly
due to left-sided cardiac pathology in the form of advanced mitral, aortic, and left ventricular myocardial
disorders.[1] [5] [6]

Pathophysiology
Normal tricuspid valves develop dysfunction with elevation of right ventricular systolic and/or diastolic
pressure, right ventricular cavity enlargement, or tricuspid annular dilation with leaflet tethering.[1] [5] [6]
 The pathologic consequences of advanced TR are related to a reduced cardiac output and elevated right
atrial pressure, which, if longstanding, leads to atrial distension with reduced contractile reserve and atrial
fibrillation.[7] Often, patients with chronic severe TR will present with ascites from advanced liver disease
from chronic congestion or fibrosis (cardiac cirrhosis), gut congestion with symptoms of dyspepsia or
indigestion, and fluid retention with leg edema.[6]

Classification
TR severity as determined by echocardiographic quantification of
annular diameter
Normal tricuspid valve annulus diameter in adults is 28 mm (± 5 mm) in the 4 chamber view. Significant
tricuspid annular dilation is defined by a diastolic diameter of over 40 mm (absolute value) or 21 mm/square
meter of body surface area.[2] A correlation exists between tricuspid annulus diameter and TR severity: a
systolic tricuspid diameter >3.2 cm or a diastolic tricuspid annulus diameter >3.4 cm are often markers of
more significant TR.[3]

In case of multiple jets, the respective values of the vena contracta width are not additive.[3]
Echocardiography Doppler quantification of TR
Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) radius of 1 mm to 4 mm suggests mild TR, 5 mm to 8 mm moderate
TR, and >9 mm severe TR, at an aliasing velocity setting (the velocity of a flow that exceeds the color
Doppler scale) of approximately 40 cm/second. An effective regurgitant orifice area ≥40 mm² or a regurgitant
volume of ≥45 mL indicates severe TR. The PISA method may underestimate the severity of TR; it is less
accurate in multiple jets.[3] Quantification is important, as there is great variability in interpreting TR severity
based on semi-quantitative indices alone.[4]
Doppler color flow jet quantification of TR
The color flow area of the regurgitant jet is not recommended to quantify the severity of TR.

Color flow imaging should only be used for diagnosing TR. A more quantitative approach is required when
more than a small central TR jet is observed.[3]
Inferior vena cava flow reversal quantification of TR
The systolic hepatic flow reversal is specific for severe TR. It represents the strongest additional parameter
for evaluating the severity of TR.[3] Concomitant presence of atrial fibrillation or right ventricular pacing
reduces the specificity of this finding.
Case history
Case history #1
A 78-year-old man was diagnosed with left-sided systolic heart failure 14 years ago. He was subsequently
found to have atrial fibrillation, and underwent atrioventricular node ablation and pacemaker placement
10 years ago that resulted in an improvement in his left ventricular ejection fraction from 35% to 50%. He

did extremely well over the years and was very active. Four months ago, however, he started developing
chest and back tightness when pulling his cart during golfing sessions. In addition, he developed
significant dyspnea with activity and his symptoms have worsened. Now, he says his quality of life
is extremely poor. He has problems walking up one flight of stairs where he experiences significant
shortness of breath; even walking half a block causes shortness of breath and chest tightness. He has
also noticed increased abdominal girth, early satiety, and easy fatigue.
Case history #2
A 73-year-old woman presented for the first time 5 years ago with worsening shortness of breath and
lower extremity edema. On clinical examination she has a laterally displaced apical impulse, with a
loud 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex. Jugular veins are distended to the angle of the jaw. Lung
examination shows some bibasilar crackles. There is 2-3+ pitting edema in both lower extremities.
Echocardiography shows a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (40%), hypokinesis of the inferior and
lateral walls, ischemic mitral regurgitation (severe), and mild TR.
Other presentations
A spectrum exists such that TR may not be associated with any symptoms until a late stage of the
disease involving progressive right ventricular dysfunction.[1] In some patients moderate or severe TR
may be present without the classic clinical complaints. The symptoms of left-sided cardiac disease
predominate in most patients with secondary TR. The symptoms specific to advanced tricuspid valve
disease are related to a reduced cardiac output and elevated right atrial pressure. Effort intolerance or
dyspnea reflects the limited cardiac reserve. Long-standing elevated right atrial pressure leads to atrial
distension with reduced contractile reserve and atrial fibrillation. Often, patients with chronic severe
TR will present with ascites from advanced liver disease from chronic congestion or fibrosis (cardiac
cirrhosis), bowel congestion with symptoms of dyspepsia or indigestion, and fluid retention with leg
edema.[5]

Tricuspid regurgitation Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
TR is most often found secondary to, or in association with, left-sided cardiac pathology in the form of
advanced mitral, aortic, or left ventricular myocardial disorders.[1] The most commonly associated conditions
include ischemic or degenerative mitral regurgitation. Other associated factors include a history of rheumatic
heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, and permanent pacemaker placement. TR may be a consequence of
endocarditis or carcinoid syndrome.TR rarely presents as an isolated disease process.
The pathological consequences of advanced TR are related to reduced cardiac output and right atrial
hypertension. The clinical sequelae include atrial fibrillation, findings of advanced liver disease from chronic
congestion or fibrosis (cardiac cirrhosis), and findings of congestive heart failure.[15] [16]

History and examination
The clinical evaluation begins with a review of the patient’s history for conditions associated with
tricuspid regurgitation, including left-sided heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, permanent pacemaker,
endocarditis, and carcinoid heart disease.
The symptoms of left-sided cardiac disease predominate in most patients with secondary TR and include
fatigue, effort intolerance, or dyspnea. Patients may describe palpitations due to atrial fibrillation or flutter.
Right heart failure can also be associated with TR. The clinical presentation involves exercise limitation,
fatigue, and evidence of systemic venous congestion.[7] [15] Additional signs and symptoms associated
with right-sided heart failure include abdominal distention from ascites; liver pulsation due to advanced
liver disease from chronic congestion or fibrosis (cardiac cirrhosis); gut congestion with symptoms of early
satiety, dyspepsia, or indigestion; and fluid retention with leg swelling.[7]
The physical exam may note the following:
• Irregular pulse.
• Abnormal and prominent v wave in the jugular venous pulse.[7]

Tricuspid regurgitation Diagnosis
• Lower left parasternal systolic murmur (holosystolic or less than holosystolic, depending on the
severity of hemodynamic derangement). Increased systolic murmur on inspiration (Carvallo sign)
may be present.[7]
• Peripheral edema.
• Pulsatile liver.
Investigations
Diagnosis of TR is most often made with a transthoracic echocardiogram, which assesses the structure
and motion of the tricuspid valve, measures annular size, and identifies other cardiac abnormalities
that might influence tricuspid valve function.[5] Systolic pulmonary artery pressure >55 mmHg is likely
to cause TR with anatomically normal tricuspid valves, whereas TR occurring with systolic pulmonary
artery pressures <40 mmHg likely reflects a structural abnormality of the valve apparatus. Functional
or secondary TR is characterized by annular dilation, the extent of which may determine its severity.[1]
Doppler echocardiography permits estimation of the severity of TR and right ventricle systolic pressure. A
transesophageal echocardiogram can be performed if the transthoracic approach does not yield adequate
quality images for accurate assessment.
ECG is routinely used to test for atrial flutter or fibrillation, or the presence of a previous myocardial
infarction, and as part of preoperative assessment.
Liver function tests, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and complete blood count (for anemia and
thrombocytopenia) are used to assess renal and liver abnormalities.
Chest x-ray, to assess for heart failure and enlargement, will also show the presence of a pacemaker and/
or pericardial effusion.
Cardiac catheterization is rarely required to establish or confirm TR, but is still useful for assessment of
pulmonary artery pressures, heart hemodynamics, and coronary artery disease.[5]
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is seldom required. However, it is the preferred technique for
assessment of right ventricular function, and is important for those patients in whom right heart function is
a determinant of operability.
Intraoperative assessment
• The effects of monitored anesthesia on cardiac hemodynamics will often falsely lower the
magnitude of TR. For this reason, transesophageal echocardiography is not used to assess the
degree of TR; however, it is accurate in determining tricuspid annular size.
Transesophageal echocardiography has become the standard intraoperative tool for valve
operation and, for the most part, provides excellent intraoperative assessment of results.
Postoperative assessment
• Transthoracic echocardiography is also the standard tool for valve assessment after operation. It is
accurate and noninvasive.

Tricuspid regurgitation Diagnosis
jugular venous abnormality (common)
• The abnormal and prominent v wave in the jugular venous pulse indicates the pressure wave of right
ventricle systole transmitted through the incompetent tricuspid valve.[7]
irregular heart rhythm (common)
• Sign of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
parasternal systolic murmur (common)
• Lower left parasternal systolic murmur (holosystolic or less than holosystolic, depending on severity of
hemodynamic derangement).[7]
increased systolic murmur on inspiration (Carvallo sign) (common)
• Increased systolic murmur on inspiration.[7]
peripheral edema (common)
• Related to reduced cardiac output and associated with both left- and right-sided heart failure.[7] [16]
Other diagnostic factors
abdominal distension (uncommon)
• Patients with chronic severe TR can present with abdominal distension from ascites, due to advanced
liver disease from chronic congestion or fibrosis (cardiac cirrhosis) related to reduced cardiac output in
right-sided heart failure.[7] [16]
early satiety, dyspepsia, or indigestion (uncommon)
• Symptoms due to gut congestion related to reduced cardiac output and associated with right-sided
heart failure.[7] [16]
liver and systemic venous pulsation (uncommon)
• An enlarged and pulsatile liver is usually seen in severe TR, and is caused by reverse blood flow to the
liver during systole. Severe TR can even result in systemic venous pulsation, for example with pulsatile
varicose veins.[17]
Risk factors
Strong
left-sided heart failure
• The most common cause of right heart failure. Most clinically significant TR occurs from elevation of
right ventricular systolic and/or diastolic pressure, right ventricular cavity enlargement, or tricuspid
annular dilation secondary to left-sided cardiac pathology in the form of advanced mitral, aortic, and
left ventricular myocardial disorders.[1] [5]
dilated tricuspid annulus
• The tricuspid valve orifice area is decreased during atrial and ventricular systole, supporting the
concept that "contraction" of the tricuspid valve annulus contributes to normal closure of the valve.

Any abnormality that impairs function of the annulus can result in valve regurgitation. Tricuspid valve
annulus dilation is most commonly secondary to chronic heart failure, left-sided rheumatic valvular

rheumatic heart disease
• Rare cause of isolated TR. When it results, it is most common in association with rheumatic left-sided
valvular heart disease. About one third of all patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease have
documented rheumatic tricuspid valvulitis.[9] [10] [11]
permanent pacemaker
• Risk factor for left-sided heart failure and subsequent TR.[1] [12]
endocarditis
• Acquired cause of TR.
carcinoid heart disease
• Acquired cause of TR that can cause scarring of the valve.

Weak
pacemaker lead entrapment
• Insertion of a pacemaker or an internal cardiac defibrillator lead regularly results in mild regurgitation.
However, damage to the tricuspid valve or leaflet restriction by the lead may produce moderate or
severe symptomatic TR and may not be overtly visualized by echocardiography.[12]

Normal tricuspid valve annulus diameter in adults is 28 mm (± 5 mm) in the 4 chamber view. Significant
tricuspid annular dilation is defined by a diastolic diameter of over 40 mm (absolute value) or 21 mm/square
meter of body surface area.[2] A correlation exists between tricuspid annulus diameter and TR severity: a
systolic tricuspid diameter >3.2 cm or a diastolic tricuspid annulus diameter >3.4 cm are often markers of
more significant TR.[3]

Echocardiography Doppler quantification of TR
Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) radius of 1 mm to 4 mm suggests mild TR, 5 mm to 8 mm moderate
TR, >9 mm severe TR, at an aliasing velocity setting (the velocity of a flow that exceeds the color Doppler
scale) of approximately 40 cm/sec. An effective regurgitant orifice area ≥40 mm² or a regurgitant volume of
≥45 mL indicates severe TR. The PISA method may underestimate the severity of TR by 30%, and is also
less accurate in eccentric jets.[3] Quantification is important, as there is great variability in interpreting TR
severity based on semiquantitative indexes alone.[4]
Doppler color flow jet quantification of TR
The color flow area of the regurgitant jet is not recommended to quantify the severity of TR. Color flow
imaging should only be used for diagnosing TR. A more quantitative approach is required when more than a
small central TR jet is observed.[3]
Inferior vena cava flow reversal quantification of TR
The systolic hepatic flow reversal is specific for severe TR. It represents the strongest additional parameter
for evaluating the severity of TR.[3] Concomitant presence of atrial fibrillation or right ventricular pacing
reduces the specificity of this finding.

Tricuspid regurgitation Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The management of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is guided by the underlying etiology and pathology of the
tricuspid valve. A better understanding of the negative impact of isolated tricuspid regurgitation on long-term
prognosis has led to an increased role for surgical correction. In primary TR, surgery may be an option in all
cases. Tricuspid valve repair or replacement is recommended for severe TR at the time of left-sided valvular
surgery and in isolated severe symptomatic TR in the absence of significant right ventricular dysfunction.
Surgery should be considered in all other cases (moderate TR or TR with annular enlargement at the time of
left-sided valve surgery; severe TR in asymptomatic patients with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction;
severe symptomatic TR after left-sided surgery in the absence of pulmonary hypertension).[2] [5]
All patients with significant levels of TR (moderate or worse) or who may have pulmonary artery hypertension
should be managed in conjunction with a specialist.
Medical management
The medical management of patients with tricuspid valve disease may be divided into 2 parts. The first is
the treatment of the underlying cause of the tricuspid disease. The second part is the medical treatment
of congestive heart failure, which includes the use of inotropic agents, diuretics, beta-blockers, and
vasodilating agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists).[16] [20] Associated
atrial arrhythmias should be treated for rate and rhythm control.
Risk factor modification
In patients with heart failure, the success of pharmacological therapy is strongly related to, and greatly
enhanced by, encouraging the patient and his/her family to participate in various complementary non-
pharmacological management strategies. These mainly include lifestyle changes, dietary and nutritional
modifications, exercise training, and health maintenance.
• Dietary sodium intake is an easily modifiable factor that complements pharmacological therapy
for heart failure. Thus the patient and family are advised to follow a daily dietary sodium intake
between 2 and 3 g. Further restriction to 1 to 2 g/day may be necessary for patients with advanced
symptoms refractory to therapy.
• Fluid restriction is mostly used as an in-hospital complementary measure in cases of acute
exacerbations. In addition, fluid restriction may be warranted in cases of severe hyponatremia.
However, it would be important to advise the patient to keep a daily intake/output balance at home.
Patients are advised to monitor their weight daily and to immediately contact their healthcare
provider if a specified change in weight occurs.
• Patients with heart failure need continuous and close monitoring of their health. A variety of
programs have been shown to decrease morbidity and rehospitalization in this context, including
home nursing, telephone advice/triage, telemedicine services, and specialised heart failure clinic-
based care.[21]
• Exercise training has also been shown to be beneficial.[22] [23]
In addition, blood pressure and glycemic control should be maintained at recommended targets, weight
loss promoted in overweight patients, and tobacco and alcohol discontinuation recommended.[24]
Statins or aspirin may be used in the treatment of patients with associated coronary artery disease or
ischemia.[25]

Tricuspid regurgitation Management
In people with atrial fibrillation (AF), aspirin is no longer recommended for stroke prevention, regardless
of stroke risk.[26] [27] Stroke prevention in AF is primarily guided by the CHA₂DS₂-VA Score, focusing on
nongender-based risk factors to estimate thromboembolic stroke risk.[26]
Anticoagulation, typically with direct oral anticoagulants or warfarin, remains the primary approach
for stroke prevention in people with AF, depending on eligibility and clinical factors. For symptom
management, both rate control and rhythm control strategies are considered, with the choice of approach
individualized to each patient's condition. See Established atrial fibrillation  and New-onset atrial fibrillation
.
Indications for operative management
US and European guidelines recommendations are:[2] [5]
• Tricuspid valve repair is beneficial for severe TR in patients with mitral valve disease requiring mitral
valve operation.
• Tricuspid valve repair is reasonable for patients with severe TR undergoing left ventricular assist
device implantation.
• Tricuspid valve replacement or annuloplasty is reasonable for severe primary TR when
symptomatic.
• Tricuspid valve replacement is reasonable for severe TR secondary to diseased/abnormal tricuspid
valve leaflets not amenable to annuloplasty or repair.
• Tricuspid valve annuloplasty may be considered for less than severe TR in patients undergoing
mitral valve surgery when there is pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid annular dilation (>40 mm or
>21 mm/square meter of body surface area).
• Tricuspid valve replacement or annuloplasty is not indicated in patients with mild primary TR.
• Surgery may be considered in patients who have asymptomatic severe TR with evidence of right
ventricular enlargement or dysfunction.
Choice of operation: valve repair versus replacement
The decision to repair or replace the tricuspid valve depends on the etiology of the valve regurgitation,
degree of leaflet and/or chordal dysfunction (i.e., tethering), and presence or significance of pulmonary
hypertension.[2] [5] [6] Most valves are assessed with a plan toward valve repair. Indications for valve
replacement over repair include severe subvalvular disease affecting leaflet mobility, severe annular
dilation, right ventricular dysfunction, or pulmonary hypertension. Tricuspid valve repair has been shown
to have reduced mortality rates at 1 month and 10 years when compared with valve replacement.[28] [29]
Tricuspid valve repair
The most widely practiced operations for tricuspid valve repair reduce the annular circumference without
manipulation of the subvalvular apparatus (e.g., a morphologically normal valve). Techniques include
suture bicuspidization (Kay annuloplasty), DeVega annuloplasty, edge-to-edge repair, and ring (or band)
annuloplasty.[30] The latter is the authors' preferred technique. All techniques recognize that the septal
leaflet is intimately related to the central fibrous skeleton of the heart and, much like the intertrigonal
area of the anterior mitral leaflet, is not prone to dilation; as such, the septal leaflet is not included in
tricuspid annular repair. An added benefit of these repairs is that they leave a gap in the region of the
atrioventricular node and its associated conduction tissue, thus avoiding complete heart block. The
annuloplasty should not reduce the tricuspid valve annulus to <25 mm in diameter, as further annular
reduction may lead to tricuspid valve stenosis.

MANAGEMENT
Valve options for replacement
Choice of valve depends on many factors: age, severity of cardiac disease and life expectancy,
concomitant use of mechanical prostheses for left-sided valve replacement, need for chronic
anticoagulant therapy, sex, etiology of TR (Ebstein anomaly, rheumatic pathology, endocarditis),
and right ventricular function have all been shown to affect morbidity and mortality of tricuspid valve
replacement. The native tricuspid valve leaflet tissue is preserved as much as possible. There is no
definitive consensus for which prosthesis is best with respect to tricuspid valve replacement. Prosthetic
choice is left to the surgeon's clinical judgment, taking into consideration each patient's characteristics
and needs.
Factors that favor use of a bioprosthetic are age >65 years, short life expectancy (<5 years), operation for
endocarditis, male sex, poor right ventricular function/large right atrium, and no need for anticoagulation.
Factors that favor use of a mechanical prosthesis are age <65 years, longer life expectancy (>5 years),
concomitant use of a left-sided mechanical valve, female sex, good right ventricular function/small right
atrium, and need for chronic anticoagulation.[31]
Subsequent pacemaker therapy
Temporary ventricular pacing wires are recommended in all patients. Furthermore, some surgeons
advocate routine placement of permanent screw-in epicardial ventricular pacing leads at the time of
tricuspid valve operation, as permanent pacemaker lead placement across a repair is associated with
failure of the repair.[32]

Acute
right ventricular dysfunction, or pulmonary
hypertension.
» Tricuspid valve repair has been shown to have
reduced mortality rates at 1 month and 10 years
when compared with valve replacement.[28] [29]
» Acute TR is rare and usually related to acute
bacterial endocarditis. Operation includes
debridement of endocarditis and repair of
tricuspid valve if possible.
» Repair techniques include pericardial patch
repair of leaflet perforation(s), placement of
artificial chordae, and annuloplasty. Valve
resection and/or replacement may be indicated
in selected situations.
» Temporary ventricular pacing wires are
recommended in all patients. Some surgeons
advocate routine placement of permanent screw-
in epicardial ventricular pacing leads at the time
of tricuspid valve operation.[32]
adjunct heart failure management and risk factor
modification
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Medical management of congestive heart
failure includes inotropic agents, diuretics,
beta-blockers, and vasodilating agents (e.g.,
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists).[16] [20] Associated atrial
arrhythmias should be treated for rate and
rhythm control. Failure of outpatient therapy can
be an indication for intravenous inotropic agent
therapy.
» In people with heart failure, lifestyle
changes should include dietary and nutritional
modifications, exercise training, and health
maintenance.[21] [22] [23] Weight loss in obese
patients and optimization of blood pressure and
glycemic control are also recommended.[24]
Statins or aspirin may be used in the treatment
of patients with associated coronary artery
disease or ischemia.[25]
» In people with concurrent atrial fibrillation,
depending on further risk factors, a DOAC
or warfarin is recommended for stroke
prevention, while rhythm control, rate control,
and lifestyle modifications are considered
to manage symptoms. Aspirin is no longer
recommended.[26] [27] See Established atrial
fibrillation  and New-onset atrial fibrillation .

Tricuspid regurgitation Management
Emerging
Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI)
TTVI have been studied in trials and currently the European guidelines recommend that TTVI may
be considered at experienced centers for symptomatic, inoperable, anatomically eligible patients
in whom symptomatic or prognostic improvement can be expected.[2] In the TRILUMINATE trial,
tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) was compared with medical therapy in patients with
symptomatic severe TR and was associated with improvements in quality of life.[35] [36] Mortality rates
and hospitalizations for heart failure were similar between groups.[35] The TRISCEND study evaluated
transfemoral tricuspid valve replacement in patients with moderate symptomatic TR despite medical therapy
and found it was associated with reduced TR, and improved clinical, functional, and quality of life measures
at one year of follow-up.[37] [38]
Patient discussions
Patients should be instructed in the symptoms of atrial arrhythmia and heart failure. Urgent follow-up
should be obtained following the development of symptoms.

Tricuspid regurgitation Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients with TR should be followed up at regular intervals of 6 to 12 months. Evaluation should include
clinical assessment with ECG and echocardiogram, and may be spaced out further in the absence of any
new symptoms over several years.[5]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
atrial arrhythmia (flutter/fibrillation) long term high
Longstanding elevated right atrial pressure leads to atrial distension with reduced contractile reserve and
atrial fibrillation. A small cohort study reported that 76% of patients who had previously undergone left-
sided valve surgery were found to have preoperative fibrillation or flutter at admission for tricuspid valve
surgery.[44]
advanced liver disease long term medium
Patients with chronic severe TR will often develop ascites from advanced liver disease, from chronic
congestion or fibrosis (cardiac cirrhosis). A small cohort study reported that 30% of patients had ascites
and 27% an elevated total bilirubin 2.0 mg/dL or greater prior to undergoing tricuspid valve surgery after
left-sided valve surgery.[44]
atrioventricular block long term low
Injury to the conduction tissue during tricuspid valve repair or replacement is uncommon. In a longitudinal
study of 81 patients undergoing tricuspid valve replacement, 8.6% of patients required definitive
pacemaker implantation following surgery.[45]
myocardial infarction long term low
The right coronary artery can be injured during tricuspid valve repair or replacement. Suture placement
can directly injure and kink the artery, both of which can result in arterial insufficiency and infarction.
prosthetic valve thrombosis long term low
Patients with mechanical valve replacement receive lifelong anticoagulation to reduce the risk of prosthetic
valve thrombosis. The incidence depends on the type of prosthesis inserted, but is typically low. In one
study of 265 patients over 10 years, the linearized rate of thrombosis was 0.8% per patient year for the St.
Jude Medical valve.[46] Moreover, the mechanical thrombosis rate appears to be equivalent to the rate of
bioprosthetic degeneration.[47]
prosthetic valve endocarditis long term low
Estimated at 1% per year.

Tricuspid regurgitation Follow up
Prognosis
From a technical standpoint, tricuspid valve repair/replacement is not complex and can often be conducted
on a warm, beating, perfused heart. There are only a few large series of operations done for isolated TR, in
contrast to the more extensive literature on mitral regurgitation. Large series were published that included
patients operated on primarily for left-sided cardiac pathologies but who also underwent incidental tricuspid
valve procedure due to a range of tricuspid valve pathologies.[28] [39] Several principles of treatment can be
gleaned from the available literature on TR and tricuspid valve surgery.
Long-term outcome: all patients
Patients who require tricuspid valve operation constitute a high-risk group. Thirty-day mortality in patients
who received concomitant tricuspid valve procedure in addition to the correction of other cardiac pathologies
has been shown to be as high as 19%.[28] The high operative mortality is representative of the underlying
cardiac pathology and is not necessarily reversed with successful operation. Outcomes mostly depend on
concomitant cardiac pathologies.
Follow-up of patients at 30 years showed an actuarial survival of 12%.[39] The numbers have been
representative of what amounts to an incurable valve disease.
Long-term outcome: recent advances
Outcomes related to a more recent year of operation suggest improved results. Operation before 1989 is
a significant predictor of late death: 66% for operation before 1989 and 32% for operation after 1989.[39]
The improved outcomes certainly represent important clinical, diagnostic, and surgical advances that have
taken place. In addition, a better understanding of TR and its clinical presentation allow earlier diagnosis and
treatment. Patients are much better served with operation before significant end-organ damage (i.e., cardiac
cirrhosis) develops.
Repair versus replacement
Tricuspid valve repair is associated with better perioperative and long-term outcomes than valve
replacement.[28] [29] The authors of this monograph favor valve repair in patients with functional TR with
relatively preserved heart function and normal pulmonary artery pressures.
Durability of valve repair
There is an important point to be made with respect to tricuspid valve repair: it does not always give a
durable result.[29] Reoperation for failure of tricuspid valve repair is associated with high mortality, both
perioperatively and in the long term.[40]
Risk factors for failure of valve repair
Risk factors for failure of tricuspid valve repair failure that have been investigated include:
• Left and right ventricular function.[41]
• Increased right and left ventricular pressures.[41]
However, it has been shown that there is no difference with respect to freedom from valve-related mortality
and from tricuspid valve reoperation.[29]
Association with mitral valve regurgitation
Mitral regurgitation often results in secondary tricuspid annular dilation that may or may not be accompanied
by TR. The resultant dilation is an ongoing disease process that can lead to severe TR and worse outcome if
patients are not treated with concomitant tricuspid valve annuloplasty.[34] [42] The authors of this monograph
would recommend tricuspid annuloplasty in patients when the annulus is significantly dilated.[34]

Implications of restoration of sinus rhythm
TR is common in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery, and atrial fibrillation may cause progression of TR.
A case-control study found that continued atrial fibrillation after mitral valve surgery may predispose a patient
to progression of TR, and this progression may be prevented through correction of atrial fibrillation with the
Maze procedure.[43]

Images
Figure 1: Severe tricuspid regurgitation due to annular enlargement. A. Systolic frame from apical 4 chamber
view (Mayo Clinic display format with right ventricle on the right). Note tricuspid annular enlargement
measuring 4.2 cm and tethering of the tricuspid leaflets leading to failure of coaptation of the tricuspid valve.
B. Massive tricuspid regurgitation on Color Doppler. C. Continuous Wave Doppler through the tricuspid valve.
Note the dagger-shaped tricuspid regurgitant signal (arrows), consistent with rapid equalization of pressures
between right ventricle and right atrium, typical of massive tricuspid regurgitation. D. Pulsed Wave Doppler of
the hepatic veins demonstrates late systolic flow reversals consistent with severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Figure 2: Severe tricuspid regurgitation due to carcinoid valvular disease. A. Systolic frame from mid-
esophageal 4 chamber view. Note thickened tricuspid leaflets, but also retracted and thickened chordae,
typical of advanced carcinoid valvular disease (arrows). The right ventricle and right atrium are enlarged.
The atrial septum is deviated to the left, demonstrating right atrial pressure is higher than left atrial pressure
(asterisk). B. Color Doppler demonstrating severe tricuspid regurgitation. Vena contracta measured 1.2 cm,
consistent with the coaptation gap on 2D images and virtually free flow between the right ventricle and right
atrium.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To

quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
