Cardiac tamponade Overview
Summary
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency.
May be a complication of any disorder that results in pericardial effusion. In people from endemic regions,
tuberculosis pericarditis remains a prominent cause of pericardial effusion and tamponade.
Presenting symptoms range from mild dyspnea and atypical chest pain to cardiogenic shock. Clinical signs
include: tachycardia, hypotension, distant heart sounds, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a pulsus
paradoxus (>10 mmHg variation in systolic blood pressure with inspiration).
Echocardiography is essential for evaluation.
Rapidly fatal if not promptly drained through needle pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage of the
pericardium.
Definition
Cardiac tamponade, also known as pericardial tamponade, is the accumulation of pericardial fluid, blood,
pus, or air within the pericardial space (pericardial effusion) that causes an increase in intrapericardial
pressure, restricting cardiac filling and decreasing cardiac output. It is a medical emergency and can be
rapidly fatal if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated.[1] The diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is based on
clinical suspicion and supported by evidence of hemodynamic compromise on echocardiography.[2]

Cardiac tamponade Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Given cardiac tamponade is caused by any disorder that results in pericardial effusion, its epidemiology is
directly related to the epidemiology of the causative conditions and risk factors for those disease states. Few
direct epidemiologic data exist for cardiac tamponade in the literature.[12]
Cardiac tamponade may occur in up to 13% of patients hospitalized with acute pericarditis and incidence
has been shown to be 30% to 44% in patients with large, chronic pericardial effusions (>10 mm on
echocardiogram).[13] [14] [15] It is more common in patients with specific underlying causes such as
malignancy (particularly lung and breast cancer), purulent pericarditis, and tuberculosis, but rarer in patients
with acute idiopathic pericarditis.[15] [16] [17]
In people from endemic regions, tuberculosis pericarditis remains a prominent cause of pericardial effusion
and tamponade.[18] [19] Cardiac tamponade can occur at any age but is most commonly seen in middle-
aged and older populations, though this depends on the underlying cause.[14] [16]
Etiology
The etiology of cardiac tamponade varies widely, as pericardial effusions have several different causes, and
is affected by factors such as demographic characteristics, clinical settings, or geographic distribution. In up
to 60% of patients, known previous conditions can be identified as the cause of pericardial effusion.[16]
Common etiologies include:[12] [14] [15] [16] [18] [19][20] [21] [22]
• Malignancy (particularly lung and breast cancer)
• Idiopathic pericardial effusion
• Viral infection (pericarditis)
• Tuberculosis (in endemic regions)
• Trauma
• Iatrogenic (secondary to cardiac surgery or intervention)
• Uremia
• Radiation-induced pericarditis
• Collagen vascular disease
• Hypothyroidism/myxedema
See Evaluation of pericardial effusion .
Pathophysiology
Cardiac tamponade is determined by the rate of pericardial fluid accumulation, pericardial stretch, and the
effectiveness of compensatory mechanisms.[23] [24]
In classic cardiac tamponade, pericardial pressures are elevated because of fluid accumulation in the
pericardial space. Ventricular diastolic, right atrial, and wedge pressures all rise to equal pericardial
pressures in response to compression countering chamber collapse.[2] This equalization of pressures is the
hemodynamic hallmark of tamponade. Once the pericardial pressure exceeds intrachamber pressures, the
chamber collapses.[2]

Cardiac tamponade Theory
When the pericardium is stretched, full of fluid and inelastic, typical respiratory variation in left and right
ventricular filling is greatly exaggerated. Inspiration increases negative intrathoracic pressures and
augments venous return to the right heart. This increased volume in the right heart forces the intra-atrial
and intraventricular septums into the left heart. This is known as "ventricular interdependence."[25] Thus,
the volumes within the left heart will be decreased with inspiration, resulting in an exaggerated decrease
in systemic cardiac output and a drop in systemic blood pressure. Clinically, this is known as the pulsus
paradoxus, a drop in systemic blood pressure >10 mmHg with inspiration.
On echocardiogram, ventricular interdependence is demonstrated by diastolic collapse of the right ventricle
or septal shift with the act of respiration (septal bounce), or when there is more than 30% variation in
transmitral inflow velocities during inspiration, and/or greater than 60% for transtricuspid inflow velocities.[4]
 The impaired diastolic filling is best appreciated in the right heart chambers, given the lower filling pressures.
In cases of severe pulmonary hypertension, with severely elevated right atrial and ventricular pressures, the
changes in diastolic filling may be first seen in the left heart chambers.
Classification
Clinical classification of cardiac tamponade
Acute tamponade
• This rapid-onset tamponade is seen in cardiac/great vessel trauma or as a complication of invasive
cardiac procedures.
• Presents with the classic features of the Beck triad (hypotension, jugular venous distention, and distant
heart sounds).
• Effusion may be small, given the relative inelasticity of the pericardium.[3]
Subacute tamponade
• A more gradual process of fluid accumulation, allowing for stretching of the pericardium and much
larger effusions than seen with acute tamponade.[4]
• Is the most common type of tamponade encountered in practice.
• Typically seen in patients with neoplastic disease, tuberculosis, uremia, or idiopathic disease.
Symptoms may be more subtle and some or all of the Beck triad may be absent.[4]
Regional tamponade
• Caused by a loculated pericardial effusion or a compressing pericardial hematoma that mechanically
impinges on a chamber of the heart, impairing normal filling.[4][5]
• Symptoms vary and diagnosis may be difficult with echocardiography.
• Seen localized in the ventricular after myocardial infarction and in the posterior atria after open-heart
surgery.[5]
Low-pressure tamponade
• Low-pressure physiology caused by concomitant large pericardial effusion and hypovolemia.[6] [7]
 Right atrial pressures fall, and a small rise in intrapericardial pressure with pericardial effusion may
result in chamber collapse.
• Can be seen in hypovolemic states associated with hemorrhage, hemodialysis/ultrafiltration, reduced
oral intake and vomiting (usually in patients with cancer), or overdiuresis.[4][5] [6]
• Typical signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability are often absent.[4][6]

Cardiac tamponade Theory
THEORY
Effusive constrictive pericarditis
• An uncommon and distinct classification of tamponade. Presents with features of acute effusive
pericarditis concomitant with cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis.[4][8]
• Tamponade develops due to a combination of effusion and restriction as a result of inflamed/scarred
pericardium.
• Occurs more frequently in those with malignancy or prior radiation exposure.[9]
Case history
Case history #1
A 65-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of decreased exercise tolerance and progressive
dyspnea at rest. He does not recall any recent illness, denies recent travel or illicit habits, and takes no
medications. Over the past 24 hours he has also noted chest discomfort and bilateral ankle edema. On
exam, he is in mild distress, with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 13 cm and distant heart sounds. His
lungs are clear on auscultation and 1+ pedal edema is noted. He is normotensive with a heart rate of 105
beats per minute (bpm) and a pulsus paradoxus is also evident (>10 mmHg).
Case history #2
A 47-year-old woman presents to her oncologist with decreased exercise tolerance. She was diagnosed
with breast cancer 3 years ago and has undergone radical mastectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy.
Recently, she has been diagnosed with metastatic disease. On exam, she is tachypneic, has an elevated
JVP, and her heart sounds are muffled. She is hypotensive with a blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. Her
heart rate is 110 bpm, and a pulsus paradoxus is present (15 mmHg drop with inspiration).
Other presentations
Cardiac tamponade may have various presenting symptoms ranging from mild dyspnea and atypical
chest pain to cardiogenic shock.[2][10] The presence of pulsus paradoxus (>10 mmHg drop in systolic
blood pressure with inspiration) is often seen in severe tamponade.[11] Elevated jugular venous pressure
is also seen in most cases.

Cardiac tamponade Diagnosis
Approach
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency that is rapidly fatal if not promptly recognized and treated.
Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and supported by evidence of hemodynamic compromise on
echocardiography.[2]
History and physical exam
Patients may be unable to provide a full medical or surgical history, particularly if they are severely
hemodynamically unstable or in cardiogenic shock; however, where possible, pertinent risk factors and
potential underlying causes should be elicited. These include: malignancy (including any treatments
received), recent infection, recent history of cardiac surgery or intervention, end-stage renal failure,
tuberculosis, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disease.[18] [27] [31][35] [36][37][38]
Up to 90% of patients with cardiac tamponade will report dyspnea. Other commonly reported symptoms
include: chest pain (12% to 74%), fever (7% to 70%), abdominal pain (12% to 61%), and orthopnea (23%
to 51%).[10] Note that symptoms vary between patients and will also be related to the underlying cause.
In classic tamponade presenting with hemodynamic instability, signs and symptoms will be consistent
with low cardiac output and stroke volume coupled with high right-sided filling pressures and increased
sympathetic tone.[2] Typically, these are often absent in patients with low-pressure tamponade due to
underlying hypovolemia.[4][6]
Most patients will not present with all of the classic features of the Beck triad (hypotension, distant
heart sounds, and elevated jugular venous pressure).[10] [40][41] One systematic review found that the
sensitivities of hypotension and distant heart sounds were low, at 26% and 28%, respectively.[40] The
most common physical exam findings included: tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, and pulsus
paradoxus (>10 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure with inspiration), with pooled sensitives of 76% to
82%.[40] Severe pulsus paradoxus can lead to a disappearance of the peripheral pulses with inspiration.
Investigations
Given the critical nature of cardiac tamponade, diagnostic investigations are narrower in scope.
Echocardiography is a first-line investigation that must be performed in all patients with suspected
tamponade.[4][15] Imaging with cardiac computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) does not have a role in acute cases where life-saving intervention is required, but may be
considered in more complex etiologies. Laboratory tests may be useful in investigating underlying
etiology. Chest x-ray (CXR) and ECG are not diagnostic.
Laboratory tests
Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein are useful in evaluating
for inflammatory, infective, or anemic causes or pericardial effusion as may be found in inflammatory
pericarditis or anemia in chronic renal failure.[15]
Biomarkers of myocardial injury are elevated in cardiac trauma or myocardial infarction.

Cardiac tamponade Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Transthoracic echocardiogram
Echocardiography is a first-line investigation in cases of suspected cardiac tamponade as it provides
rapid, readily available hemodynamic data to detect tamponade physiology.[4][15] Alongside evidence of
pericardial effusion, findings that are diagnostic of cardiac tamponade include:[4]
• Inversion of the free wall of the right atrium for more than one third of systole.[42]
• Right ventricular (RV) diastolic collapse if the right ventricular wall is of normal compliance.[11] [43]
• A variation in transmitral inflow greater than 30% and/or in transtricuspid flow greater than 60%
during respiration on Doppler recording (the echocardiographic demonstration of the clinical sign of
pulsus paradoxus).[4][15] [44]
• A variation in chamber sizes with respiration (larger RV and smaller left ventricle [LV] with
inspiration).
• Dilated inferior vena cava (IVC) and hepatic veins.
• Reduced LV size and appearance of LV hypertrophy.
• Septal shift (or "bounce") with inspiration.
If diagnostic echocardiographic features are absent but tamponade is still clinically suspected, atypical
forms of tamponade (loculated effusion, low pressure, external compression from tumor, or pleural
effusion) should be considered and further investigated.
ECG
Although ECG is not diagnostic for tamponade, it may be useful in identifying pericarditis as an underlying
cause.[15] A rhythm strip should be collected to look for beat-to-beat electrical alternans, which is a more
specific sign of tamponade and is rarely seen in its absence.[5] [15] Low QRS voltage may also indicative
of tamponade, but its absence does not exclude it.[15] [45]
CXR
CXR has no role in the initial diagnostic workup of cardiac tamponade as it is neither sensitive nor
specific. The pericardium can hold over 200 cm³ of fluid before an enlarged silhouette is noted.[2] [5]
 However, CXR may be helpful in ruling out other causes of dyspnea and chest pain.
Cardiac CT or MRI
Cardiac CT or MRI may be considered in cases of complicated cardiac tamponade: for example, in
postoperative or loculated pericardial effusions.[4]
Evidence of cardiac tamponade on static CT and MRI include:[4]
• Compression of the anterior cardiac surface causing a “flattened heart”.
• Angulation/bowing of the interventricular septum (correlating with inspiratory septal bounce on
echocardiography).
• Enlarged superior vena cava and IVC.
On dynamic CT and MRI, diagnostic features of cardiac tamponade are similar to those found on
echocardiography.
Cardiac catheterization
The most specific test for the diagnosis of tamponade is demonstration of equalization of chamber
pressures; however, invasive hemodynamic monitoring is rarely necessary and is infrequently performed

Cardiac tamponade Diagnosis
in patients with pure tamponade.[15] It is useful in differentiating tamponade from constrictive pericarditis
or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
Pericardiocentesis fluid for culture and cytology
Pericardiocentesis may help differentiate the underlying cause in nontraumatic cases and is the mainstay
of treatment, but may also be useful in diagnosing potential etiology.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
malignancy (common)
• Metastatic disease (particularly breast and lung cancer) is much more likely than primary pericardial/
cardiac malignancy to cause cardiac tamponade.[27] Effusion may be secondary to cancer therapy
rather than actual metastatic pericardial disease.[26] [27] [28]
presence of other risk factors (common)
• Key risk factors include: aortic dissection, purulent pericarditis, large idiopathic pericardial effusion,
tuberculosis, end-stage renal failure, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disease.[18] [29][31] [33][36]
[37][38]
dyspnea (common)
• Up to 90% of patients will report dyspnea.[10]
elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) (common)
• One of the three signs of the Beck triad.
• Central venous pressure is increased in an effort to maintain ventricular volumes.[10] One systematic
review found that the pooled sensitivity of elevated JVP was 76% (95% CI 62% to 90%).[40] 
distant heart sounds (common)
• One of the three signs of the Beck triad.
• Heart sounds may be muffled secondary to large pericardial effusion.[10] One systematic review found
that the pooled sensitivity of distant heart sounds was low at 28% (95% CI 21% to 35%).[40]
pulsus paradoxus (common)
• Refers to a reduction in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg with inspiration. Severe pulsus paradoxus
can lead to a disappearance of the peripheral pulses with inspiration. One systematic review found
that the pooled sensitivity of pulsus paradoxus >10 mmHg was 82% (95% CI 72% to 92%) and that
its presence in a patient with a pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of tamponade (positive
likelihood ratio 3.3), while a pulsus paradoxus ≤10 mmHg makes tamponade unlikely (negative
likelihood ratio 0.03).[40]

Cardiac tamponade Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
hypotension (common)
• One of the three signs of the Beck triad.
• Has been reported to occur in up to 35% of patients with nontraumatic tamponade.[10] One systematic
review found that the pooled sensitivity of hypotension was low at 26% (95% CI 16% to 36%).[40]
tachycardia (common)
• One of the most common findings in cardiac tamponade.[40] Has been reported to occur in up to 88%
of patients.[10] One systematic review found that the pooled sensitivity of tachycardia was 77% (95%
CI 69% to 85%).[40]
recent cardiac surgery or intervention (uncommon)
• Cardiac surgery or intervention is a strong risk factor for tamponade. In surgical patients, tamponade
is most common following valve surgery and heart transplant and less common in isolated coronary
artery bypass graft.[5] [34] [35] Rarely, tamponade may occur after thrombolysis or angioplasty,
percutaneous coronary interventions, ablations, and pacemaker/defibrillator implantation.[22]
Beck triad: hypotension, distant heart sounds, and elevated JVP (uncommon)
• Most patients will not present with all of the classic features of the Beck triad (hypotension, distant
heart sounds, and elevated JVP).[10] [40] [41] The triad was originally described in patients with acute
tamponade secondary to trauma or surgery. In some medical patients, especially where the pericardial
effusion has developed slowly, Beck triad may not be present at all.[40]
Other diagnostic factors
chest pain (common)
• Atypical, nonexertional chest pain. Has been reported to occur in 12% to 74% of patients.[10]
abdominal pain (common)
• Secondary to hepatic congestion and or hypoperfusion. Has been reported to occur in 12% to 16% of
patients.[10]
fever (uncommon)
• May indicate underlying infective etiology. Has been reported to occur in 7% to 70% of patients.[10]
pericardial rub (uncommon)
• More common in inflammatory etiologies of pericardial effusions. May be absent in large effusions.[2]
Risk factors
Strong
malignancy
• Malignancy is a common cause of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusions and, therefore,
of cardiac tamponade, with lung and breast cancer the most common primary sites.[14] [16] [18] [26]
Primary malignancies of the pericardium are rare.[27]
• Tamponade without inflammatory signs is more likely to be related to malignancy.[20]

Cardiac tamponade Diagnosis
• Up to 60% of malignancy-related effusions are not directly caused by the malignancy but are
complications of radiation or systemic cancer therapy.[15][26] [27][28]
aortic dissection
• Cardiac tamponade is a common and life-threatening complication of acute type A aortic dissections
(AAD).[12] [29] Findings from a large cohort of the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection
found that tamponade was detected in 18.7% of patients.[30]
purulent pericarditis
• Severe bacterial infection of the pericardium is rare but rapidly fatal and carries a high risk of
tamponade.[31] Cardiac tamponade may occur in up to 79% of patients with purulent pericarditis.[32]
large idiopathic chronic pericardial effusion
• Patients with large chronic effusions (>3 months) with inflammatory signs are more likely to develop
tamponade than those without inflammatory signs.[20] Around one third of patients with large
asymptomatic pericardial effusions will develop clinically significant tamponade.[33]
post-cardiac surgery or intervention
• Cardiac tamponade may present rapidly, secondary to hemorrhage (hemopericardium). In surgical
patients, tamponade is most common following valve surgery and heart transplant and less common
in isolated coronary artery bypass graft.[5] [34] [35] Rarely, tamponade may also occur after
thrombolysis or angioplasty, percutaneous coronary interventions, ablations, and pacemaker/
defibrillator implantation.[22]
• Symptomatic postoperative pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade can also occur as a late
complication of cardiac surgery/intervention. One study followed up cardiac surgery patients for 6
months post-procedure and found that 6.2% of patients underwent treatment for late postoperative
pericardial effusion, of whom two-thirds were classified as having tamponade.[35] Median delay to
presentation was 11 days post-operation (range: 8-87 days).
tuberculosis (TB)
• In people from endemic areas, especially in patients with HIV infection, the incidence of TB pericarditis
and effusion is high. In a large urban study in the UK, TB accounted for 26% of pericardial effusions
requiring surgical drainage. Most of these patients were native to areas with endemic TB.[18]
Weak
autoimmune disease
• There are no large studies investigating the incidence of pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade
in patients with autoimmune diseases, but most case series report frequent detection of pericardial
effusion with a low incidence of tamponade.[36]
hypothyroidism
• Though pericardial effusions are seen in up to 37% of patients with severe hypothyroidism, fluid
accumulates slowly and tamponade rarely occurs.[15] [37]

DIAGNOSIS
end-stage renal failure
• Usually develops gradually so the risk of tamponade is diminished. Asymptomatic pericardial effusions
are reported to occur in 70% to 100% of patients with uremic- or dialysis-related pericarditis; cardiac
tamponade occurs in up to 20% of patients with dialysis-related pericarditis.[38]
anticoagulation
• May increase the risk of large, hemorrhagic pericardial effusions when used in the management of
anterior wall myocardial infarctions or constrictive pericarditis, or following cardiac surgery.[39]

Cardiac tamponade Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Differentials
Condition Differentiating signs /
symptoms
Differentiating tests
Constrictive pericarditis • Seen after radiation therapy
or after cardiac surgery or
recurrent pericarditis.
• Constrictive pericarditis
behaves as if there were
a box around the heart.
Patients have Kussmaul
sign: an increase in jugular
venous pressure with
inspiration. This is typically
absent in tamponade.[4]
• Echocardiogram typically
can distinguish between
constrictive pericarditis
and cardiac tamponade,
as constrictive pericarditis
typically has a thickened
pericardium and no effusion.
Early diastolic filling is rapid,
with impaired late diastolic
filling in constriction. In
tamponade, both early and
late filling are impaired.[4]
• CT or MRI may be used
to assess the pericardial
thickness.
• Invasive hemodynamic
measurements show a steep
y-descent before chamber
equalization that is absent in
tamponade, creating a "dip
and plateau" or "square root
sign."
Restrictive
cardiomyopathy
• Kussmaul sign (an increase
in jugular venous pressure
with inspiration).
• Differentiated from
tamponade by absence
of effusion. Restriction
is also marked by left
ventricular hypertrophy,
pulmonary hypertension,
atrial enlargement, and lack
of respiratory reciprocal
variation.[4][44]
Cardiogenic shock • Signs and symptoms similar
to advanced tamponade.
• Echocardiogram is useful.
Expect poor ventricular
function or regions of
abnormal wall motion.
Effusion is rare. No evidence
of chamber collapse or
reciprocal variation.
Criteria
Beck triad[46]
Hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and distant heart sounds.
Most patients will not present with all of the classic features of the Beck triad (hypotension, distant heart
sounds, and elevated JVP).[40] [41] One systematic review found that the sensitivities of hypotension and
distant heart sounds were low, at 26% and 28%, respectively.[40] The most common physical exam findings

Cardiac tamponade Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment.
Patients with confirmed tamponade on echocardiographic evaluation require stabilization with pericardial
drainage through needle pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage; the preferred approach will depend on
the underlying tamponade etiology and on patient comorbidities.[15] Following intervention, patients must
be monitored (preferably in an intensive care unit) for pericardial decompression syndrome: a rare, but life-
threatening complication of pericardial drainage that results in paradoxical hemodynamic instability and/or
pulmonary edema.[47]
Medical therapy is generally ineffective in the treatment of tamponade. Intravenous fluids may be given
to hypovolemic patients; however, this only provides temporary stability.[48] [49] Inotropes are ineffective,
and neither vasodilators or diuretics are recommended in tamponade management.[15] Positive pressure
mechanical ventilation may further decrease cardiac filling, as it increases intrathoracic pressure, and
therefore should be avoided.[50]
Concomitant management of any identified underlying etiologies is key.[15] Further diagnostic investigation is
required in patients without an apparent cause of tamponade.
Management of patients without hemopericardium, trauma, or
purulent effusion
In the absence of hemorrhage, trauma, and purulence, patients with cardiac tamponade should
be treated with needle pericardiocentesis under echocardiographic or fluoroscopic guidance.[15]
 Pericardiocentesis should be undertaken immediately in patients presenting with sudden hemodynamic
collapse and large pericardial effusion. In extreme, life-threatening circumstances where tamponade is
known or suspected but imaging guidance is not available, pericardiocentesis should be attempted by
experienced operators using anatomic landmarks.
Major complications include: laceration of the coronary arteries or myocardium, laceration of the liver or
abdominal viscera, air embolus, pneumothorax, damage to the phrenic nerve, or arrhythmias.[51] [52]
Such complications occur in 1.5% to 2.0% of cases using echocardiographic guidance and in about 1% of
cases using fluoroscopic guidance.[34] [53]
Pericardiocentesis is contraindicated in aortic dissection and relatively contraindicated in patients with
severe coagulopathy.[15] Immediate surgical drainage may be considered as an alternative option if
pericardiocentesis is contraindicated.
Management of patients with hemopericardium, trauma, or
purulent effusion
Surgical drainage is indicated in the management of cardiac tamponade complicated by
hemopericardium, trauma, or purulent effusion.[15]
Although several surgical modalities exist for pericardial drainage, there is a lack of randomized trials
comparing outcomes between different techniques. Choice of modality, therefore, depends on the
surgeon’s preferred technique and the underlying etiology.
The traditional surgical approach involves a small subxiphoid incision, direct visualization of the
pericardium, and incising the parietal pericardium. Drainage through video-assisted thoracoscopy with the

Cardiac tamponade Management
creation of a pericardial window is another approach that creates a communication between the pleura
and the pericardium, allowing the pericardium to decompress.[54] One small retrospective study found an
association with increased operative time and periprocedural morbidity, but a lower recurrence of effusion
and tamponade.[55] Balloon pericardiotomy is a percutaneous, minimally invasive approach that has
good short-term success rates and a low incidence of recurrent effusion or tamponade.[15]
Management of patients with pericarditis
In patients with cardiac tamponade secondary to nonpurulent pericarditis (i.e., viral or idiopathic),
treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and colchicine should be given alongside
the intervention.[56] This is to prevent pericardial fluid reaccumulation. Where pericarditis is refractory to
initial medical treatment, or recurs after initial response, the addition of a corticosteroid or interleukin-1
inhibitor should be considered. The AIRTRIP trial, a randomized trial of anakinra versus placebo for
refractory pericarditis in 21 patients, showed that anakinra was significantly associated with reduction
in the occurrence of recurrent pericarditis and led to the discontinuation of corticosteroids in all patients
compared with placebo.[57] In the RHAPSODY trial, rilonacept monotherapy significantly reduced the
recurrent of pericarditis.
Purulent pericarditis is a rare occurrence with the advent of antibiotics, although it is a strong risk factor
for tamponade.[32] Where it is suspected, intravenous antibiotic therapy must be started immediately.

Patient discussions
In up to 60% of patients, known previous conditions can be identified as the cause of pericardial
effusion.[16] Patients with risk factors for pericardial effusion or tamponade should be advised regarding
frequently reported signs and symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain) and to seek urgent
medical attention should these develop.
Patients without a clear etiology for tamponade will require further diagnostic investigation.

Cardiac tamponade Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
While routine imaging after drainage is not recommended to detect reaccumulation, patients should be
followed up closely for the development of symptoms. There should be a low threshold to re-image if
patients become symptomatic. For patients with pericardial drains in place, repeat echocardiogram may
be performed before removal of the drain. Patients who have undergone a surgical pericardial "window"
are at some risk to reaccumulate an effusion, particularly if the etiology of the effusion persists.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
recurrent pericardial effusion short term high
Recurrence of the effusion will be determined by the underlying etiology. If the underlying disease is
managed appropriately, the risk of recurrence is much less.
Pericardiocentesis, windows, and traditional surgical drainage may all close and allow reaccumulation
of fluid. The recurrence rate is about 50% after pericardiocentesis, and about 10% to 20% after surgical
drainage in patients with malignant effusions.[20] [53]
See Evaluation of pericardial effusion .
cardiac arrest short term medium
Without prompt diagnosis and urgent intervention, cardiac tamponade can progress to cardiovascular
collapse, ultimately resulting in cardiac arrest.
cardiogenic shock short term medium
In severe hemodynamic collapse, patients may present in cardiogenic shock.[2] Renal failure may develop
secondary to organ hypoperfusion.
pericardial decompression syndrome (PDS) short term low
Following pericardial drainage, patients must be monitored (preferably in the intensive care unit) for PDS:
a rare, but life-threatening complication of pericardial drainage that results in paradoxical hemodynamic
instability and/or pulmonary edema.[47]
death variable medium
In-hospital mortality rates have been most closely associated with the causative disease: acute myocardial
infarction (70% to 100%), aortic dissection (65%), bleeding/anticoagulation (40%), malignancy (16%),
iatrogenic (10%), infectious/inflammatory (8%).[10] [20]
Malignancy-related cardiac tamponade has a poor prognosis with around 80% mortality at 12 months.[58]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
