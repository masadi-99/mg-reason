Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Overview
Summary
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiomyopathy and the most frequent cause of
sudden cardiac death in young people.
Presentation varies from asymptomatic to symptoms of heart failure.
Physical examination may be normal at rest. Auscultation along the left sternal border when the patient is
standing after a brief period of exercise may elicit a murmur.
Family history may be present. Echocardiography should be used to screen first-degree family members.
Has a benign prognosis in the majority of patients.
Medical therapy with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers is used in symptomatic
patients.
A subset of patients with increased risk for sudden death should undergo defibrillator implantation.
Definition
HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy that is not solely explained by
abnormal loading conditions.[1] It is a common genetic heart disease globally, as well as a common cause
of sudden cardiac death in young people.[2] Given its prevalence in younger patients, HCM is frequently
confused with athlete's heart. In older patients, HCM may be misdiagnosed as hypertensive heart disease.
Many patients will have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis and will be diagnosed following routine
examination or family screening of an affected family member.[1] [2]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is estimated to affect 15-20 million people worldwide and is the most
common cause of sudden death in children and young adults.[6] [7] [8] It is estimated to affect 1 in 500
adults, although population-based genetic studies suggest the condition is more common than reported, with
the prevalence of HCM gene carriers estimated at 1 in 200 people or greater.[8] [9]
The mean age of presentation differs among published series but in a large community sampling it was
noted to be 57 on average (range 16 to 87 years).[10]
While the disease is autosomal dominant with no known sex predilection, women are more likely to evade
diagnosis, presenting at an older age with a greater likelihood of New York Heart Association class III/IV
symptomatology at the time of diagnosis.[11] Sudden death is most common in young patients, and death
from heart failure or stroke occurs more frequently in middle age and beyond.[12]
While the disease can affect all ethnic groups, apical HCM is seen much more commonly in Asian people.
Apical HCM accounts for <5% of HCM cases in non-Asian people and 15% to 40% of cases in Asian
people.[13] [14]
Etiology
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease of the cardiac sarcomere, caused by mutations
in genes that encode different components of the contractile apparatus.[15] The disease is genetically
heterogeneous, with over 270 identified mutations in 13 causative genes.[16] [17] Mutations in the beta-
cardiac myosin heavy chain are the most common (44% of mutations), with mutations in the myosin binding
protein C gene second in frequency (35% of mutations).[17] Mutations in the troponin I, troponin T, and
alpha-tropomyosin genes account for 10% to 15% of mutations.[17] Up to 5% of patients may have more
than one mutation.[18] Phenotypic expression of disease is heterogeneous even within families with the
same genetic defect.[4] The overall yield of genetic testing is low in HCM, with no causative gene identified in
approximately 50% of patients.[19]
Pathophysiology
Presence of one of the responsible genetic mutations leads to septal thickening from myocyte hypertrophy
as well as abnormal, thickened, disorganized collagen matrix. Septal hypertrophy may be diffuse or localized
to one particular location of the septum. In the most classic form, hypertrophy is most marked in the septum
immediately below the aortic valve.[4] The hypertrophied septum may lead to left ventricular (LV) outflow tract
obstruction, either in isolation or in association with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.[4] Systolic
anterior motion of the mitral valve occurs in response to turbulent flow in the subaortic region wherein the
anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is pulled into the subaortic region, thereby leading to further obstruction.
Obstruction may alternatively be confined to the midcavity of the left ventricle. This occurs as a result of
midseptal hypertrophy and hypertrophy of the LV papillary muscles. Patients develop intracavitary systolic
obstruction secondary to apposition of the septum and the papillary muscles. These patients typically do not
have systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve as the obstruction is lower in the ventricular cavity. Isolated
hypertrophy of the apex may also occur (apical HCM).[4] Increased obstruction will occur in response to an
increase in heart rate, myocardial contractility, reduced ventricular volume, and peripheral vasodilation. Most
patients demonstrate impaired diastolic relaxation irrespective of the presence of hypertrophy.[4] Diastolic

dysfunction leads to increased filling pressures and is argued to be the primary source of symptoms in many
patients, particularly young people.[4] [20]
Myocardial ischemia is common and likely multifactorial in origin. It may be due to increased myocardial
oxygen demand and reduced myocardial capillary density relative to the LV hypertrophy, small vessel
disease, compression of septal perforating arteries, myocardial bridging (characterized by a segment
of a major epicardial coronary artery tunneling through the myocardium), obstruction to LV outflow, and
increased coronary vascular resistance due to abnormal LV relaxation and impaired filling.[4] The presence
of symptoms may be due to the degree of subaortic stenosis at rest and with exercise, impaired diastolic
relaxation, arrhythmias, impaired systolic contraction in the absence of obstruction, and ischemia.[4]
Classification
Obstructive versus nonobstructive
Disease is classified as obstructive or nonobstructive based on the presence or absence of left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction on echocardiography at rest.[1][2] A resting pressure gradient between the left
ventricle and the aorta is present in 37% of patients. An additional 33% will have provocable obstruction
(e.g., obstruction with exercise), such that the majority of patients have some degree of obstruction.[3] There
is not a strong correlation between symptoms and the degree of obstruction and, in fact, patients with severe
obstruction may be asymptomatic.[4]
Site of obstruction
Patients may be classified based on the site of maximal left ventricular obstruction:[4]
• Subaortic obstruction (classic)
• Midventricular obstructive HCM
• Apical HCM
• Complex obstructive HCM
Some patients may also have coexisting right ventricular (RV) obstruction. The incidence of RV systolic
obstruction in HCM has been reported as 15% to 92% by catheterization studies.[5]
Case history
Case history #1
A 21-year-old active college student with no past medical history has sudden loss of consciousness
1 hour into a game of basketball. CPR is administered by bystanders. On the arrival of an emergency
medical professional, he regains consciousness. The family history is significant for a murmur in his father
and paternal grandmother. Physical examination reveals a systolic ejection murmur that increases in
intensity when going from a supine to a standing position and disappears with squatting.
Case history #2
A 60-year-old woman presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion over the last 2 months. She is
otherwise well with no risk factors for ischemic heart disease. Family history is significant for a cousin

who died suddenly in his youth, but is otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination reveals a prominent
jugular a-wave and a double apical impulse. There are no murmurs audible. An S4 is present. The
remainder of the examination is normal.
Other presentations
Other common symptoms include: chest pain, palpitations, postural lightheadedness, resuscitated sudden
death, and fatigue.[4] Patients may remain asymptomatic and be diagnosed solely on the basis of family
screening. Diagnosis may also occur as a consequence of incidental findings (e.g., an abnormal ECG
in the context of community or work-related medical checkups or sports preparticipation screening; the
incidental detection of a murmur; or increasingly, genotype-first identification as a result of secondary
findings during research or clinical sequencing for other indications). 
In secondary and tertiary care, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may present to the heart failure
clinic with symptoms of heart failure; the arrhythmia clinic with early-onset conduction disease, atrial
arrhythmia, or ventricular arrhythmia; or the emergency department with suspected myocarditis.[1]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diagnosis
Approach
In suspected cases, an evaluation with history (including family history), physical examination, ECG, and
echocardiography should be performed. The latter establishes the diagnosis. Asymptomatic patients are
usually diagnosed at the time of routine heart examination or family screening.[1][4] Patients are most
commonly diagnosed after the onset of clinical manifestations, however, with only 32% of patients diagnosed
on routine medical evaluation.[21] Laboratory DNA analysis for mutant genes is the most definitive method
for establishing the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but is usually only used for screening
purposes.
History
Family history
A family history of syncope, heart failure, or sudden or premature death should be taken. Sudden cardiac
deaths may sometimes have been reported as accidental deaths, for example, drowning or unexplained
traffic accidents.[1] Other points to note in the family history include cardiac transplantation, pacemaker
and defibrillator implants, and features suggestive of systemic disease (e.g., stroke at a young age,
skeletal muscle weakness, or renal disease). A three- to four-generation family pedigree should be
created to aid in diagnosis, provide clues to etiology, determine inheritance pattern, and identify at-risk
relatives.[1] Sarcomeric HCM is autosomal dominant and is therefore characterized by the presence of
affected individuals across generations, with transmission from parents of either sex and a 50% risk of
allele transmission to offspring. Family history may be negative, however, as the disease has incomplete
penetrance.[1]
Symptoms
Patients may be symptom-free. However, it is important to note any symptoms of presyncope or syncope,
particularly when occurring with exercise, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, or chest pain. Patients over
50 years of age may present with atrial fibrillation or symptoms of a stroke.[22]
Physical examination
Examination may be remarkable for a left ventricular (LV) lift; a double apical impulse; a brisk carotid
upstroke; a systolic ejection murmur at the lower left edge that is accentuated by exercise and standing
and lessened by lying supine or squatting; and a fourth heart sound.[4]
Diagnostic testing
ECG
A resting 12-lead ECG is recommended at the first clinic visit in all individuals with known or suspected
HCM and should be repeated whenever there is a change in symptoms in patients with an established
diagnosis.[1] Most patients have ECG abnormalities; these are not specific to HCM, but rather, should
prompt further investigation with echocardiography. An abnormal ECG may predate the finding of
hypertrophy on echocardiography.[23]
• Repolarization abnormalities are common. T-wave inversion commonly involves the inferior and
lateral leads and T waves are deep and often preceded by ST-segment depression.[24] Deeply
inverted T waves in the precordial leads are suggestive of apical HCM.[25]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Prominent abnormal Q waves may be seen in the inferior (II, III, aVF) and/or lateral (I, aVL, V5-6)
leads, reflecting septal hypertrophy.[25]
• Increased QRS voltages indicating left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may be present. These are
nearly always associated with other ECG abnormalities in HCM.[24] The presence of isolated
QRS voltage criteria for LVH in the absence of other ECG markers is present in fewer than 2% of
patients with HCM.[26]
• ECG signs of left and right atrial enlargement and P-wave prolongation (a known predictor of
atrial fibrillation) may be observed. They rarely occur in isolation; other ECG abnormalities such
as repolarization changes or signs of LVH are generally present. Left atrial enlargement reflects
diastolic dysfunction, high filling pressures, outflow obstruction, and functional mitral regurgitation.
Left atrial dilatation and dysfunction are markers of adverse prognosis.[24]
• Left-axis deviation (caused by LVH) and ventricular pre-excitation may also be seen.[24]
• Some patients may present with arrhythmias, for example, atrial fibrillation or supraventricular
tachycardia.[24]
The ECG is normal in only a small proportion (5% to 10%) of patients at presentation.[1] [25]
 These patients have been reported to have a more favorable clinical course than those with ECG
abnormalities.[26]

Laboratory tests
US guidelines do not recommend laboratory tests as part of the initial workup.[2] However, European
guidelines recommend that all patients with suspected or confirmed HCM should have routine laboratory
tests done to establish etiology, assess disease severity, and aid in the detection of extracardiac
manifestations and assessment of secondary organ dysfunction. The following first-line tests are
recommended:[1]
• Creatine kinase (CK): raised levels are a useful clue when trying to establish etiology; metabolic
disorders such as Danon or mitochondrial disease, which can mimic HCM, should be considered.
When CK is persistently raised, a detailed examination by a neurologist should be considered.
• Liver function tests: liver dysfunction is prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure. Abnormal
liver function tests can also be a useful clue when trying to establish etiology; metabolic disorders
such as Danon disease, which can mimic HCM, should be considered.
• Renal function: impaired renal function may be seen with severe LV dysfunction.
• N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP): high levels are associated with cardiovascular
events, heart failure, and death, and may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring
value.
• Troponin: higher levels are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, heart failure, and
death, and may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring value.
• Urinalysis; proteinuria is suggestive of renal impairment.
Following specialist evaluation, additional tests to detect rare metabolic and syndromic causes are often
required in patients with cardiomyopathy and extracardiac features.[1]

Transthoracic echocardiography
At initial assessment of all patients with HCM, transthoracic 2D and Doppler echocardiography are
recommended. The classic finding is LVH, typically asymmetric hypertrophy of the septum.[4] [27]
Echocardiography is also used for family screening of an affected person, and for risk assessment of
sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with a known diagnosis of HCM. 
• Clinical diagnosis of HCM is confirmed when maximal end-diastolic wall thickness ≥15 mm is
imaged anywhere in the left ventricle (LV). More limited hypertrophy (≥13 mm) can be diagnostic

when present in family members of a patient with HCM or in conjunction with a positive genetic
test.[2][27]
• Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve may also be seen, along with mitral insufficiency.[2]
• LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) may be present. By convention, LVOTO is defined as a peak
instantaneous Doppler LV outflow tract gradient of ≥30 mmHg, but the threshold for invasive
treatment is usually considered to be ≥50 mmHg.[1]
• There may be abnormalities of diastolic function.[2] Diastolic dysfunction should be assessed by
Doppler tissue imaging as part of the echocardiographic screening test of first-degree relatives, as
this abnormality may precede the onset of overt LVH.[27] [28]

DIAGNOSIS
Other types of echocardiography
• Stress echocardiography can be helpful in selected patients to evaluate myocardial ischemia.[1]
• Exercise echocardiography is useful to identify provocable LVOTO and exercise-induced mitral
regurgitation in symptomatic patients with HCM.[1]
• Transesophageal echocardiography is limited to select indications, such as the exclusion of atrial
thrombi related to atrial fibrillation, investigating the method of obstruction in patients with LVOTO
where this is not obvious, elucidating the mechanism of mitral regurgitation, or planning invasive
interventions such as septal myectomy.[1]
Exercise ECG
Exercise testing is performed to aid in risk stratification. Abnormalities associated with an increased risk
of SCD include abnormal blunted systolic BP response of <20 mmHg to exercise, ventricular arrhythmias,
progressive ST depression, and symptoms.[29] [30]
Holter monitoring
This may be normal or demonstrate ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias
are associated with an increased risk of sudden death.[25]
Nuclear medicine techniques
Patients with exertional chest pain or ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring should undergo nuclear
testing with either single-photon-emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography.[27]
 Myocardial perfusion imaging may demonstrate perfusion defects even in the absence of obstructive
lesions. Patients may have fixed or reversible defects. Patients with reversible defects should undergo
cardiac catheterization to identify possible causes of ischemia.
Nuclear medicine can also play a role in diagnosis; it is particularly helpful in the etiological diagnosis of
cardiac amyloidosis.[1]
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
Contrast-enhanced CMR can be a useful adjunct in patients with HCM at initial evaluation.[1] [2] It can aid
diagnosis and contribute to risk stratification and management.
• LV wall thickness can be assessed; the use of CMR may thus increase the diagnostic yield in
patients with suspected HCM who have poor visualization by echocardiogram of the LV walls or
apex.[1] [2] [27]
• Systolic and diastolic function can also be assessed, as well as mitral valve function, LVOTO, and
left atrial dimensions.[1]
• The use of late gadolinium enhancement techniques can identify areas of myocardial fibrosis
that may be a marker for adverse outcomes, or may aid in differentiating HCM from an athletic
heart.[31]
• CMR is also emerging as a means of identifying patients who are at increased risk for arrhythmias.
Several studies have found the presence of myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement to
be associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, as well as an independent risk factor
for death.[2] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]
• Tissue characterization on CMR can provide clues regarding etiology, as characteristic findings
are associated with certain diseases, for example, in sarcomeric HCM, a patchy mid-wall

in hypertrophied areas is typical, while in amyloidosis-related cardiac hypertrophy, diffuse
subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement is seen. These findings should be assessed
collectively with genetic results and other clinical features by operators expert in cardiac imaging
and the evaluation of heart muscle disease.[1]
Serial follow-up CMR, every 2-5 years depending on initial severity and clinical course, can assist in
evaluating disease progression as well as the benefits of therapy.[1]
Cardiac computed tomography (CT)
Although not used commonly, CT can provide important insights when echocardiography is technically
limited and CMR imaging is contraindicated or unavailable.[2] Cardiac CT provides clear definition of LV
structure (including hypertrophy pattern, wall thickness measurement, detection of subaortic membrane,
and intracardiac thrombus) and function. Disadvantages of CT are the use of radiation and radioiodine
contrast and inferior temporal resolution compared with echocardiography.[2]
CT coronary angiography
Indicated in patients with exertional chest pain or ischemia on nuclear testing to check for the presence
of concomitant coronary artery disease or myocardial bridging, comorbidities which can affect the clinical
manifestations and course of HCM.[1] [2] [27]
Cardiac catheterization
In symptomatic patients with HCM and inconclusive noninvasive cardiac imaging, left and right heart
catheterization may be considered to assess the severity of LVOTO and to measure LV filling pressures.[1]
[2] It can also be used to check for the presence of concomitant coronary disease or myocardial bridging,
and is recommended for patients who are candidates for septal reduction therapy.[2]
Endomyocardial biopsy
Endomyocardial biopsy is not usually recommended for diagnosis of HCM but may be considered on
rare occasions, especially when the pattern of hypertrophy is diffuse and there is suspicion for other
cardiomyopathies presenting with hypertrophy.[1]
Risk stratification
Risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD)
After diagnosis, patients should undergo risk stratification including Holter monitoring and exercise ECG,
unless contraindicated, to further define their risk of sudden death.[2]
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has developed a risk prediction calculator for SCD at 5 years
in patients ≥16 years with HCM.[38] Risk calculation is based on age, maximal LV wall thickness, left
atrial diameter, LV outflow tract gradient, family history of SCD, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia,
and unexplained syncope. Risk of SCD should be reevaluated at 1-2 year intervals or whenever there
is a change in clinical status.[1] These models should not be used in elite athletes or in individuals
with metabolic/infiltrative diseases (e.g., Anderson-Fabry disease) and syndromes (e.g., Noonan
syndrome).[1]
It should be noted that current risk-stratification models may be unreliable in the prediction of future
sudden death, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement may still be warranted in patients
with low-risk scores.[39] US guidelines reflect this uncertainty, recommending that the tool be used as

DIAGNOSIS
an aid to the shared decision-making process for ICD placement in patients with clinical risk markers,
whereas European guidelines recommend that it should be used as the basis of decision-making for all
patients with HCM.[1] [2]
ESC guidelines recommend that implantation of an ICD should be considered in patients with an
estimated 5-year risk of sudden death of ≥6%, following detailed clinical assessment that considers: (i)
the lifelong risk of complications; (ii) competing mortality risk from the disease and comorbidities; AND
(iii) the impact of an ICD on lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and psychological health. It may also be
considered in patients with a risk between ≥4% and <6% on an individual basis. For patients who are in
the low-risk category (<4% estimated 5-year risk of SCD), ICD is generally not recommended. However,
the guidelines acknowledge that ICD may be considered in low-risk patients who have extensive late
gadolinium enhancement (≥15%) on CMR or LV ejection fraction <50%; these factors do not form part of
the HCM risk-SCD, but evidence suggests that they increase the risk of SCD. Shared decision-making is
recommended.[1]
Risk factors for SCD are as follows:[1] [2] [40]
• Younger age: some studies have reported a significantly increased risk of SCD in younger patients.
• Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (defined as ≥3 consecutive ventricular beats at ≥120 beats
per minute lasting <30 seconds) on Holter monitor: occurs in 20% to 30% of patients.
• Abnormal blood pressure (BP) response to exercise: defined as a rise in systolic BP of <20 mmHg,
no rise, or a fall in BP of >20 mmHg during exercise. Drugs may affect the BP response and should
be considered in the interpretation of exercise test results.
• Massive hypertrophy (LV wall thickness ≥30 mm).
• Severe LVOTO by echocardiogram (LVOTO >30 to 50 mmHg): while severe obstruction is
considered a minor risk factor for sudden death, the degree of outflow tract obstruction generally
does not correlate with the risk of sudden death. Medical therapy or surgery to decrease outflow
tract obstruction does not decrease the risk of sudden death.
• Family history of sudden death: while definitions vary, a family history of SCD is usually considered
clinically significant when one or more first-degree relatives have died suddenly ages <40 years
with or without a diagnosis of HCM, or when SCD has occurred in a first-degree relative at any age
with an established diagnosis of HCM.
• Personal history of unexplained syncope.
• Prior cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular tachycardia.
• LV systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <50%.
• Left atrial enlargement.
• Presence of LV apical aneurysm.
• Diffuse and extensive late gadolinium enhancement by cardiac MRI: cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging is emerging as a means of identifying patients who are at increased risk for arrhythmias.
Several studies have found the presence of myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement to
be associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.[33] [34] [35] [36] [37] The presence of
fibrosis has also been found to be an independent risk for death.[32]
Considerations for comorbidities
Ischemia
Ischemia may be related to myocardial bridging, LVOTO, or massive hypertrophy with reduced myocardial
perfusion. The presence of ischemia is a weak risk factor for SCD. Patients with angina or ST depression
on exercise ECG should be evaluated for ischemia with nuclear imaging or CT angiography if the

likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) is relatively low. CT angiography or cardiac catheterization
are indicated if there is a higher likelihood of CAD given other patient factors.[2][41] Myocardial bridging
(tunneling of coronary arteries into the heart muscle) should also be considered in the setting of angina
or ischemia. Cardiac catheterization or CT angiography can be used to evaluate bridging with specific
attention given by the interpreter to this possible diagnosis.[42] 
Heart failure
Patients with HCM may present with symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea; persistent cough; ankle edema,
fatigue).[1] Transthoracic echocardiography (which is done at initial assessment of all patients with HCM)
allows for the accurate determination of biventricular systolic and diastolic function. Measurement of NT-
proBNP is also recommended; high levels are associated with cardiovascular events, heart failure, and
death, and may have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring value.[1]
Atrial fibrillation (AF)
In patients at high risk of AF, extended ambulatory ECG monitoring should be considered at initial
evaluation and as part of annual follow-up.[1] [2]
Genetic mutation analysis
Genetic testing in an individual with cardiomyopathy (known as confirmatory testing or diagnostic testing)
is recommended for their direct benefit: (i) to confirm the diagnosis; (ii) where it may inform prognosis;
(iii) where it may inform treatment selection; or (iv) where it may inform their reproductive management.
Genetic testing of an affected individual may also be indicated if there are relatives who may benefit
from testing, particularly those who will be enrolled in long-term surveillance if the genetic etiology is not
established (and who may be spared this burden if a genetic diagnosis is made in the family).[1]
The clinical utility of genetic testing has limitations. Currently identified disease-causing genes are thought
to account for only 80% of cases. Moreover, the sensitivity of commercially available genetic testing
depends on the number of genes screened for by the particular laboratory and may be <80%. When
the 8 most common sarcomeric mutations are screened, the clinical sensitivity approaches 60%.[17] 
In up to 40% of patients with HCM, no sarcomere variant is identified, and there is no family history of
disease.[43] The absence of a monogenic disease-causing variant on conventional genetic testing leaves
three possibilities: (i) either there is a monogenic cause that has not been identified (i.e., not detected or
recognized as causative by current testing); (ii) the cardiomyopathy does not have a genetic etiology; or
(iii) the cardiomyopathy is attributable to the effects of multiple variants of individually smaller effect.[1]
Despite its limitations, genetic testing is of value in screening family members of an affected patient
with an identified mutation. Genetic testing in this situation will determine who requires ongoing clinical
evaluation (known as cascade testing):[1] [2] [43][44]
• Relatives with the identified mutation should continue to be screened for the clinical development
of HCM. The development of clinically apparent disease may occur late in adulthood, so screening
should be lifelong.
• Gene-negative relatives can be reassured that they do not have the disease-causing mutation and
do not require further screening.
While identification of a gene mutation during cascade testing indicates that the development of HCM is
very likely, genotype-phenotype variability exists. Despite identical gene mutations, the gene mutation
may manifest as HCM, restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, or no clinically apparent

abnormality in different patients. For those without apparent disease, late-onset penetrance must be
considered.[45] The risk of sudden death may be low or high for the same mutation.[46]
Genetic counseling should be available for all patients who are offered genetic testing, to inform
decision-making and ensure so that results can be reviewed and their clinical significance appropriately
determined.[1] The importance of potential psychologic, social, legal, ethical, and professional
implications of having a genetic disease should also be discussed, and appropriate support provided.[2]
Prenatal genetic counseling should be offered to parents who have had a previous affected child with an
inherited HCM due to a single or multiple pathogenic variant(s), or to couples where one or both partners
carries a known pathogenic variant.[1] [47] The risk of disease transmission should be discussed, as well
as potential reproductive options (e.g., in-vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal
genetic screening, and postpartum genetic testing).[2] [43]
Advances in genetic sequencing technology and increased accessibility to testing have led to an
increasing number of incidentally identified genetic variants associated with HCM. Interpreting the clinical
relevance of such findings can be challenging; the American Heart Association has produced guidance
on how to manage them, with emphasis on a multidisciplinary team approach.[48] The American College
of Medical Genetics and Genomics has recommended that cardiomyopathy-associated genes be
evaluated for secondary findings whenever broad clinical sequencing is undertaken, regardless of the
initial indication for testing.[49] There is currently no international consensus around this recommendation,
however.[1] 
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
family history of HCM (common)
• Autosomal dominant pattern but variable penetrance.
history of presyncope or syncope (common)
• Syncope with exertion or without a prodrome is particularly concerning and may be due to either
outflow tract obstruction or a ventricular arrhythmia.
systolic ejection murmur (common)
• Audible at the lower left edge, accentuated by exercise and standing and lessened by lying supine or
squatting.[4]
left ventricular lift (heave) (common)
• Best palpated at the left ventricular apex.
double apical impulse or double carotid pulsation (common)
• An initial upstroke of the apical impulse or pulse may be felt, followed by a brief collapse and a second
impulse. This transient interruption in cardiac output occurs when the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve
is pulled into the left ventricular outflow tract during systole (systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diagnosis
family history of sudden death (uncommon)
• Affected family members may have presented with sudden death, thereby eluding a definitive
diagnosis.[4]
Other diagnostic factors
younger male (<50 years) (common)
• Males are typically diagnosed at a younger age (<50 years) and are often asymptomatic at time of
diagnosis (detected on routine clinical evaluation).
• HCM is most commonly diagnosed in patients ages 30 to 50 years.[10] [12]
dyspnea (common)
• Some patients may experience dyspnea.[1][4]
• Dyspnea on exertion may be due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, or
end-stage heart failure related to HCM.
angina (common)
• Some patients may experience angina.[1]
• Chest pain with exertion is particularly concerning and may be due to massive hypertrophy with
impaired coronary perfusion, outflow tract obstruction, or myocardial bridging (tunneling of coronary
arteries into heart muscle). Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease should also be considered in the
adult with exertional chest pain.
palpitations (common)
• May represent either ventricular arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation.
irregularly irregular pulse (common)
• A sign of atrial fibrillation.
• Atrial fibrillation predisposes to thrombus formation and warrants anticoagulation as well as
antiarrhythmic therapies.
older female (>50 years) (uncommon)
• Females are much more likely to be diagnosed at a later age and be symptomatic at the time of
diagnosis.[12]
collapse (uncommon)
• Patients may present with resuscitated sudden death or syncope with extreme exertion. This may be
the only symptom.[4] [29]
fourth heart sound (uncommon)
• A fourth heart sound (S4) occurs late in diastole and suggests a stiff ventricle or impaired diastolic
filling related to hypertrophy.

ECG
• A resting 12-lead ECG is recommended at the first clinic visit in all
individuals with known or suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM) and should be repeated whenever there is a change in
symptoms in patients with an established diagnosis.[1] Most
patients have ECG abnormalities; these are not specific to HCM, but
rather, should prompt further investigation with echocardiography.
An abnormal ECG may predate the finding of hypertrophy on
echocardiography.[23]
• Repolarization abnormalities are common. T-wave inversion
commonly involves the inferior and lateral leads and T waves are
deep and often preceded by ST-segment depression.[24] Deeply
inverted T waves in the precordial leads are suggestive of apical
HCM.[25]
• Prominent abnormal Q waves may be seen in the inferior (II, III, aVF)
and/or lateral (I, aVL, V5-6) leads, reflecting septal hypertrophy.[25]
• Increased QRS voltages indicating left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
may be present. These are nearly always associated with other ECG
abnormalities in HCM.[24] The presence of isolated QRS voltage
criteria for LVH in the absence of other ECG markers is present in
fewer than 2% of patients with HCM.[26]
• ECG signs of left and right atrial enlargement and P-wave
prolongation (a known predictor of atrial fibrillation) may be observed.
They rarely occur in isolation; other ECG abnormalities such as
repolarization changes or signs of LVH are generally present. Left
atrial enlargement reflects diastolic dysfunction, high filling pressures,
ST-T wave abnormalities;
prominent Q waves; LVH;
P-wave abnormalities;

• Echocardiography is also used for family screening of an affected
person, and for risk assessment of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in
patients with a known diagnosis of HCM.
• Clinical diagnosis of HCM is confirmed when maximal end-diastolic
wall thickness ≥15 mm is imaged anywhere in the left ventricle (LV).

• Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve may also be seen, along
with mitral insufficiency.
• LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) may be present.[2] By
convention, LVOTO is defined as a peak instantaneous Doppler
LV outflow tract gradient of ≥30 mmHg, but the threshold for
invasive treatment is usually considered to be ≥50 mmHg.[1] [2]
Transthoracic echocardiography allows for the accurate determination
of biventricular systolic and diastolic function. Diastolic dysfunction
should be assessed by Doppler tissue imaging as part of the
echocardiographic screening test of first-degree relatives, as this
abnormality may precede the onset of overt LVH.[27] [28]

exercise ECG
• Exercise testing is performed to aid in risk stratification.
• Abnormalities associated with an increased risk of sudden death
include: abnormal blunted systolic BP response of <20 mmHg to
exercise, ventricular arrhythmias, progressive ST depression, and
symptoms.[29] [30]

demonstrate reduction
in maximal oxygen
consumption, abnormal

Holter monitoring
• Ventricular arrhythmias are associated with an increased risk of

• In patients at high risk of AF, extended ambulatory ECG monitoring
should be considered at initial evaluation and as part of annual
follow-up.[1] [2]

demonstrate ventricular
or supraventricular
arrhythmias
nuclear imaging exercise test
• Patients with exertional chest pain or ventricular tachycardia on Holter
monitoring should undergo nuclear testing with either single-photon-
emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography.[27]
Myocardial perfusion imaging may demonstrate perfusion defects
even in the absence of obstructive lesions. Patients may have fixed
or reversible defects. Patients with reversible defects should undergo
cardiac catheterization to identify possible causes of ischemia.
• Nuclear medicine can also play a role in diagnosis; it is particularly
helpful in the etiological diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.[1]
may be evidence of
ischemia
cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
• Contrast-enhanced CMR can be a useful adjunct in patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at initial evaluation.[1] [2] It can
aid diagnosis and contribute to risk stratification and management.
Left ventricular (LV) wall thickness can be assessed; the use of CMR
may thus increase the diagnostic yield in patients with suspected
HCM who have poor visualization by echocardiogram of the LV walls
or LV apex.[1] [2] [27]
• Systolic and diastolic function can also be assessed, as well as
mitral valve function, LV outflow tract obstruction, and left atrial
dimensions.[1]
• The use of late gadolinium enhancement techniques can identify
areas of myocardial fibrosis that may be a marker for adverse
outcomes, or may aid in differentiating HCM from an athletic
heart.[31]
• CMR is also emerging as a means of identifying patients who are
at increased risk for arrhythmias. Several studies have found the
presence of myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement to
be associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, as well
as an independent risk factor for death.[2] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37]
• Tissue characterization on CMR can provide clues regarding etiology,
as characteristic findings are associated with certain diseases, for
example, in sarcomeric HCM, a patchy mid-wall in hypertrophied
areas is typical, while in amyloidosis-related cardiac hypertrophy,
diffuse subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement is seen. These
findings should be assessed collectively with genetic results and
LVH; may show left
ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, structural
abnormalities of mitral
valve and papillary
muscle, systolic and/or
diastolic dysfunction, and
left atrial enlargement;
later in disease course:

well as the benefits of therapy.[1]
cardiac computed tomography (CT)
• Although not used commonly, CT can provide important insights
when echocardiography is technically limited and imaging is
contraindicated or unavailable.[2] Cardiac CT provides clear definition
of left ventricular structure (including hypertrophy pattern, wall
thickness measurement, detection of subaortic membrane, and
intracardiac thrombus) and function. Disadvantages of CT are
the use of radiation and radioiodine contrast and inferior temporal
resolution compared with echocardiography.[2]

• Currently identified disease-causing genes are thought to account
for 80% of cases of the disease, and the sensitivity of commercially
available genetic testing may be lower depending on the number
of genes screened for by the particular laboratory. When the
eight most common sarcomeric mutations are screened for, the
clinical sensitivity approaches 60%.[17] In up to 40% of patients
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), no sarcomere variant is
identified, and there is no family history of disease.[43] The absence

• When a mutation is identified, genetic testing is useful for screening
other relatives to determine requirement for ongoing cardiology
follow-up. Relatives with the identified mutation should continue to be

clinically apparent disease may occur late in adulthood, so screening
should be lifelong. Gene-negative relatives can be reassured that
they do not have the disease-causing mutation and do not require
further screening.[1] [2] [43][44]

sudden death may be low or high for the same mutation.[46]
• Genetic counseling should be available for patients who are

statement for the diagnosis and management of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy[55]
• LVH, typically asymmetric in distribution, in the absence of another cardiac cause or systemic condition
capable of producing the magnitude of hypertrophy, such as hypertension.
• HCM is usually recognized by a maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 15 mm or greater in
adults; 13 to 14 mm is considered borderline, unless there is a definite family history of HCM. Mild
hypertrophy related to intense athletic conditioning may occur but should normalize after a period of
deconditioning.
• Myocardial biopsy is not needed for the diagnosis but shows characteristic features of myocyte
hypertrophy, fiber disarray, and interstitial fibrosis.
Screening
Screening should be performed in two distinct populations:
• Competitive athletes
• Family members of affected patients.
Screening of competitive athletes
• Screening of competitive athletes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains a controversial
topic.[56] [57] [58] The argument has been made that routine screening should be performed in all
competitive athletes, as HCM is the most common cause of sudden death in this population.[56]
• While only a minority of athletes will have significant repolarization abnormalities suggestive of a
congenital cardiomyopathy or inherited channelopathy, preparticipation screening with ECG has been
routinely performed on all competitive athletes in Italy since 1982. Based on this experience, it has
been suggested that the low incidence of sports-related sudden death in Italy has occurred as a result
of such screening.[58]
• While ECG increases the sensitivity of detecting underlying heart disease above physical examination
alone, a normal ECG may be present in up to 25% of asymptomatic patients with HCM.[59]
• Although in Europe the use of ECG screening in young athletes has been associated with a decline in
the rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in this population, this approach has not been endorsed in the
US.[59] 
• Internationally agreed criteria have been published to help nonexperts interpret the ECG in
athletes.[60] This consensus statement defines the ECG findings that warrant further evaluation for
disorders that predispose to SCD.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Diagnosis
• The significance of T-wave inversions in asymptomatic athletes is largely dependent on age, gender,
ethnicity, and duration and intensity of athletic training. It is important to quantify SCD risk in the
context of other relevant findings, such as family history of SCD and other findings of underlying
structural disease. It is generally accepted that anterior T-wave inversions are a normal variant in black
people and adolescents. In contrast, T-wave inversions seen in the lateral leads in any patient are
usually abnormal, and suggestive of underlying cardiac disease.[61]
Screening of family members
• Routine screening of all first-degree family members should be performed by echocardiography. As
the hypertrophy may not develop until a later age, a negative echocardiogram importantly does not
rule out the diagnosis.[15] [45]
• Guidelines from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommend that
initial screening in children and adolescents from genotype-positive families and families with early-
onset disease should happen at the time HCM is diagnosed in a first-degree family member.[2] For all
other children and adolescents, initial screening is recommended any time after HCM is diagnosed in
a family member, but no later than puberty. Initial screening for adults is also recommended at the time
HCM is diagnosed in a first-degree family member.[2]
• Clinical screening with history, physical exam, ECG, and echocardiogram should be repeated every 12
to 24 months throughout adolescence.
• Due to the possibility of delayed adult-onset left ventricular hypertrophy, family members older than 18
years should continue to undergo clinical screening every 3 to 5 years.[2][62]
• Echocardiograms should not be performed more frequently than 12 months as there is unlikely to have
been interval change within that time period.
• Genetic analysis is an important screening tool for extended family members when a genetic mutation
has been identified within affected family members. Genetic screening of relatives can then be used to
definitively rule out the diagnosis in unaffected individuals, thereby avoiding the need for lifelong serial
echocardiographic screening.[15] [46]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
There is no curative treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Therapies are advocated in select
patient populations in order to reduce symptoms (which may occur secondary to subaortic obstruction,
diastolic dysfunction, or ischemia) and to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Patient care
requires the collaboration of different specialties and coordination between different levels of care; a
shared care approach between cardiomyopathy specialists and general adult cardiology centers is strongly
recommended.[1]
Initial assessment and approach to treatment in all patients
On initial evaluation, patients must be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic. They must also
undergo risk stratification to further define their risk of SCD.[1] [2] Only patients with symptoms related
to outflow tract obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, or systolic dysfunction require medical therapy. Only
certain patients at high risk for SCD warrant implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.
Arrhythmic risk calculators may be useful in predicting the risk of SCD and have been validated in large
populations.[63] [64] One study, however, evaluated the 2014 European Society of Cardiology SCD
risk model for HCM. The prognostic score was applied retrospectively to a large independent cohort of
patients with HCM and was found to be generally unreliable for prediction of future SCD; most patients
who had experienced SCD or undergone appropriate ICD interventions were misclassified as low risk.[39]
Consensus recommendations have previously restricted all athletes with HCM from all competitive sports;
however, US and European guidelines now advise that participation in high-intensity exercise/competitive
sports may be considered for some individuals after comprehensive evaluation and shared discussion.[2]
[65] A large prospective cohort study found that among individuals with HCM, or those who are genotype
positive/phenotype negative, who are treated in experienced centers, those exercising vigorously do not
experience a higher rate of death or life-threatening arrhythmias than those exercising moderately or
those who are sedentary.[66] 
Asymptomatic patients
Asymptomatic patients (genotype-positive/phenotype-negative) are usually identified incidentally at
the time of routine heart exam or family screening.[1][2] These patients require ongoing monitoring for
development of clinical HCM. US guidelines recommend serial clinical assessment, ECG, and cardiac
imaging every 1-2 years in children and adolescents and every 3-5 years in adults.[2] 
Genotype-positive/phenotype-negative patients are not considered at high risk of SCD and ICD
placement is not required.[2]
Participation in competitive sport of any intensity is reasonable in genotype-positive/phenotype-negative
patients; they should be regularly assessed for change in clinical status.[2] [65]
Patients at high risk of sudden death
SCD is the most common mode of death in young people with HCM, occurring with an incidence of 1%
per year.[67] The proposed mechanism of SCD is ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation
(VF) secondary to ischemia.[4] SCD typically occurs in the setting of extreme exertion. No medical or
surgical treatment has been shown to lessen the risk of sudden death in large populations, thus ICD

therapy is first-line therapy in those patients in whom the risk of SCD is considered significant.[1] [2] For
details of risk stratification, see Diagnostic approach .
No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effect of ICD placement have been performed in
patients with HCM, although there is evidence from observational studies.[2] [68]
Guidelines recommend ICD placement for patients with HCM and previous documented cardiac arrest
or sustained ventricular arrhythmia causing syncope or hemodynamic compromise in the absence of
reversible causes.[1] [2] Comprehensive SCD risk stratification is recommended in all patients at initial
presentation, then at 1-2 year intervals or whenever there is a change in clinical status.[1] [2]
A single marker of high risk for sudden cardiac arrest may be sufficient to consider prophylactic ICD
placement in selected patients.[1] [2][68] Patients in whom this would apply include those with one or
more first-degree or close relatives 50 years or less with sudden death presumably caused by HCM,
patients with a maximum LV wall thickness greater than or equal to 30 mm, patients with one or more
recent episodes of syncope suspected to be arrhythmic, LV apical aneurysm, LV systolic dysfunction with
ejection fraction <50%, and extensive late gadolinium enhancements on cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging.[1] [2] Complications following ICD placement have been reported to occur at a rate of 3.4% per
year.[69] Contact sports should be avoided after ICD implant.[70]
Patients and caregivers should be fully informed and participate in decision-making regarding ICD
placement.[2] They should be counseled on the risk of inappropriate shocks, implant complications, and
the social, occupational, and driving implications of the device. Implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator
is only recommended in patients who have an expectation of good-quality survival >1 year.[1]
Symptomatic patients: predominantly left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction (LVOTO) with preserved systolic function
(ejection fraction ≥50%)
In symptomatic patients with LVOTO, the aim is to improve symptoms by using pharmacologic
therapy, surgery, or alcohol septal ablation. A symptomatic patient with resting or provocable LVOTO
is initially treated with negative inotropic or chronotropic therapy; beta-blockers are preferred, with
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) as alternatives.[2] Tachyphylaxis
to drugs is common, and the dosage must be adjusted over time. In the absence of many RCTs,
pharmacologic therapy is mostly administered on an empirical basis to improve functional capacity and
reduce symptoms.[1]
Addition of mavacamten (a cardiac myosin inhibitor) or disopyramide (a type Ia antiarrhythmic) is
considered if symptoms persist despite treatment with a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blocker. Septal reduction therapy is also an option for eligible patients with persistent
symptoms.[1] [2]
Low-dose diuretics may be used with caution in patients who have persistent dyspnea with clinical
evidence of volume overload and high left-sided filling pressures despite other HCM guideline-directed
medical therapy. Aggressive diuresis can worsen LVOTO.[1] [2]
Beta-blockers
• Beta-blockers are beneficial due to their negative inotropic and chronotropic properties.
Nonvasodilating beta-blockers are considered first-line therapy for symptomatic HCM due to

MANAGEMENT
LVOTO. In standard doses, they are usually well tolerated. Reported side effects include fatigue,
impotence, sleep disturbances, and bradycardia.
• Substantial experience suggests that beta-blockers can mitigate symptoms and reduce outflow
tract obstruction in those patients with LVOTO occurring with exercise. There is little evidence to
suggest a beneficial effect on resting outflow tract gradients; however, one small RCT found that
metoprolol reduced LVOTO at rest and during exercise, provided symptom relief, and improved
quality of life in patients with obstructive HCM. Maximum exercise capacity remained unchanged.
This is the first RCT in over 50 years to address the use of beta-blockers in HCM.[71] [72]
• Beta-blocker may be of benefit in patients with HCM and symptoms suggestive of ischemia.
Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
• Used for relief of symptoms, including those with a component of chest pain.[2] Verapamil and
diltiazem have vasodilating properties as well as negative inotropic and chronotropic effects.[2]
 Short-term oral administration may increase exercise capacity, improve symptoms, and normalize
or improve LV diastolic filling without altering systolic function.[1]
• Verapamil can be used when beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, but it is potentially
harmful in patients with obstructive HCM and severe dyspnea at rest, hypotension, and very high
resting gradients (e.g., >100 mmHg), and infants <6 weeks.[2] Verapamil has been reported
to cause death in a few patients with HCM and severe LVOTO or elevated pulmonary arterial
pressure as it may provoke pulmonary edema.[1] It should therefore be used with caution in these
patients.[1]
• Diltiazem should be considered in patients who are intolerant or have contraindications to beta-
blockers and verapamil.[1]
Disopyramide
• Negative inotrope and a type Ia antiarrhythmic agent. Consider addition of disopyramide for
patients with LVOTO and persistent severe symptoms despite therapy with beta-blockers or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers.[1] [2]
• US guidelines recommend that disopyramide is used in combination with an agent that has
atrioventricular nodal blocking properties (i.e., beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel
blocker), as it may enhance conduction through the atrioventricular node, which could lead to rapid
conduction with the onset of atrial fibrillation.[2]
• European guidelines also advise that disopyramide may be considered as monotherapy in patients
who are intolerant of or have contraindications to beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers.[1]
• Disopyramide decreases resting LVOTO. In one multicenter study it was shown that 75% of patients
with obstructive HCM who were managed with disopyramide had amelioration of symptoms in
association with a 50% reduction in LV outflow gradient. This beneficial effect was sustained for the
study period of 3 years.[73]
• Dose-limiting anticholinergic side effects include dry eyes and mouth, urinary hesitancy or
retention, and constipation. The ECG QT interval should be monitored for prolongation.[1]
Mavacamten
• A cardiac myosin inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York
Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive HCM to improve functional capacity and
symptoms.[1] [74] [75] It works by inhibiting cardiac myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase),
thus reducing actin-myosin cross-bridge formation; this reduces contractility and improves
myocardial dynamics.[1]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Management
• Consider addition of mavacamten for patients with LVOTO and persistent severe symptoms
despite therapy with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers.[1] [2] In
the US, mavacamten is currently available in the US through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy (REMS) program, designed to monitor patients periodically with echocardiograms for early
detection of systolic dysfunction and to screen for drug interactions prior to each prescription.[76]
• European guidelines stipulate that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, mavacamten
should not be used with disopyramide, but may be coadministered with beta-blockers or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers.[1] UK guidelines differ, stating that it can be a d d e d ‑ o n 
 to individually optimized standard care that includes b e t a ‑ b l o c k e r s ,  nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers, or disopyramide, unless these are contraindicated.[75]
• In patients with contraindications or known sensitivity to beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers, and disopyramide, mavacamten may be considered as monotherapy.[1]
• Up-titration of drug treatment to a maximum tolerated dose should be monitored in accordance with
licensed recommendations using echocardiographic surveillance of LV ejection fraction.[1]
• In the EXPLORER-HCM phase 3 trial, treatment with mavacamten improved exercise capacity,
LVOTO, NYHA functional class, and health status (symptoms, physical and social function, and
quality of life) compared with placebo in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM.[77] [78]
[79] The drug was well tolerated and has a good safety profile; only a small subset of patients
developed transient LV systolic dysfunction, which resolved after temporary discontinuation of the
drug.
• A secondary analysis found favorable changes in cardiac structure and function through 30
weeks of therapy, including improvement in echocardiographic markers of LV filling pressures,
LVOT gradients, and systolic anterior motion. Reductions in NT-proBNP were also seen, further
supporting the benefit of mavacamten on functional improvement and favorable remodeling.[80]
• Interim data from a long-term extension study, analyzed at a median follow-up of 62.3 weeks,
showed that mavacamten was associated with clinically important and sustained improvements of
LVOT gradients, NYHA class, and NT-proBNP levels that were consistent with those observed in
the parent trial. Treatment was generally well tolerated over 315 patient-years of exposure.[76]
• In the VALOR-HCM phase 3 trial, patients who were assigned to mavacamten, as well as
those who initially received placebo for 16 weeks and then crossed over to mavacamten, had a
significantly reduced need for septal reduction therapy after 56 weeks compared with placebo.[81]
• In another randomized trial (EXPLORER-CN), Chinese patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM
who received treatment with mavacamten had a significant reduction in Valsalva LV outflow tract
peak gradient, compared with those treated with placebo[82]
• Open-label, follow-up studies evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of mavacamten in
these trials, as well as real-world experience, will provide more information on the durability of
improvements and the safety profile of the drug.
Surgical myectomy (septal reduction therapy)
• If severe symptoms persist despite optimal medical therapyg, consideration should be given to
surgical myectomy, which reduces septal mass, thereby relieving obstruction.[2] Patients are
generally considered to be eligible for septal reduction therapy when they have severe dyspnea or
chest pain (New York Heart Association class III or IV) or exertional recurrent syncope, resting or
provocable outflow tract gradient of ≥50 mmHg, and appropriate anatomy.[1] [2]
• Myectomy abolishes or substantially reduces LV outflow tract gradients in over 90% of cases,
reduces systolic anterior motion-related mitral regurgitation, and improves exercise capacity and
symptoms.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Management
MANAGEMENT
• Long-term symptomatic benefit is achieved in >80% of patients, with a long-term survival
comparable to that of the general population.
• Preoperative determinants of a good long-term outcome are: age <50 years; left atrial size <46
mm; absence of AF; and male sex.[1] Older age and increased severity of comorbidities are
predictive of poor surgical outcomes.[83] 
• Surgical myectomy has not been conclusively shown to affect the incidence of sudden death.
• The rate of postoperative complications is estimated at 5.9% in most experienced centers. The
most common complications are complete heart block in patients without previous conduction
abnormality (3% to 10%), left bundle branch block (40% to 56%), and ventricular septal defect
(1%).[83] [84]
Alcohol septal ablation (ASA)
• May be performed as an alternative to surgical myectomy.
• Involves the delivery of alcohol into a target septal perforator branch of the left anterior descending
coronary artery, for the purpose of producing a myocardial infarction and reducing septal
thickness.[1]
• Septal remodeling and relief of obstruction after ASA occurs over several months, resulting in a
smaller reduction in resting gradient compared with surgical myectomy, but a similar reduction in
patient symptoms.[85] [86]
• Complications include ventricular arrhythmias (2.2%), coronary dissection (1.8%), and complete
heart block (>10%) necessitating permanent pacemaker placement.[87] There is an increased
need for permanent pacemaker implantation postprocedure compared with surgical myectomy.[88]
• Mortality from all-cause or sudden cardiac death is low after ASA.[89]
• ASA has not been conclusively shown to affect the incidence of sudden death.
• While data comparing the later outcomes of ASA and surgical myectomy are lacking, a
retrospective, observational study compared long-term mortality of patients with obstructive
HCM following both procedures. It concluded that ASA was associated with increased long-
term all-cause mortality compared with septal myectomy. This finding remained after adjustment
for confounding factors (patients undergoing ASA tend to be older with more comorbidities and
reduced septal thickness, compared with patients undergoing septal myectomy), but may still be
influenced by unmeasured confounders.[90]
Management of complications
Myocardial ischemia
Patients may develop symptoms or signs of ischemia. Ischemia in HCM is multifactorial and thus not
easily treated. Decreasing myocardial oxygen demand with negative inotropic and chronotropic agents
may prove beneficial. Etiology of the ischemia should be identified (i.e., increased LV outflow tract
obstruction, coronary artery disease, or myocardial bridging).
For patients with anomalous coronary artery, surgical unroofing of myocardial bridging (tunneling of
coronary arteries into heart muscle) has been reported to yield symptomatic improvement in select
patients, but data are limited.[30] [91] Moreover, myocardial bridging is frequently identified in HCM
and has not been conclusively linked to SCD.[92] [93] Therefore, the risks of the procedure need to be
considered when advising surgical intervention.
For patients with concomitant epicardial coronary artery disease consider PCI or CABG. See Chronic
coronary disease .

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Management
Ventricular arrhythmias
As described above, implantation of an ICD is recommended for secondary prevention in patients with
HCM who have survived a cardiac arrest due to VT or VF, or who have spontaneous sustained ventricular
arrhythmia causing syncope or hemodynamic compromise in the absence of reversible causes. It
should also be considered in patients presenting with hemodynamically tolerated VT, in the absence
of reversible causes.[1] In patients with HCM and pacing-capable ICDs, programming antitachycardia
pacing is recommended to minimize risk of shocks.[2] Although data are lacking, antiarrhythmics
such as beta-blockers (e.g., sotalol) and amiodarone should be considered for patients with recurrent,
symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia, or recurrent ICD shocks.[1] Catheter ablation in specialized centers
may be considered in select patients with recurrent, symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT (SMVT),
or recurrent ICD shocks for SMVT, in whom antiarrhythmics are ineffective, contraindicated, or not
tolerated.[2] [94]
Atrial arrhythmias
Atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF), are common, particularly in older patients with HCM.
Prevalence of AF among patients with HCM is estimated at 17% to 39%, with an annual incidence of
2.8% to 4.8%.[1] AF is often poorly tolerated in patients with HCM.[2] As a result, an aggressive strategy
for maintaining sinus rhythm may be warranted. Paroxysmal or persistent AF are linked to left atrial
enlargement.[4] AF is independently associated with heart-failure-related death, and occurrence of fatal
and nonfatal stroke, as well as long-term progression of heart failure symptoms. Management of AF is as
per patients without HCM. However, digoxin is not typically used for atrial rate control if the patient has
significant hypertrophy, as there is a theoretical concern that it could exacerbate LVOTO due to a positive
inotropic effect.[2] In addition, traditional stroke risk scoring systems used in the general population,
such as CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, age ≥75
[doubled], diabetes, stroke [doubled]-vascular disease, ages 65-74 years, sex category [female]) are not
predictive in patients with HCM, with evidence suggesting that they may perform suboptimally.[1] [2][95]
 For this reason, although there are no RCTs evaluating the role of anticoagulation in patients with HCM,
given the high incidence of stroke, prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended in all patients with HCM
and AF (if no contraindication).[1] A direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is recommended first-line option,
and a vitamin K antagonist (usually warfarin) second-line option.[1] [2][95] See New-onset atrial fibrillation
and  Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Indications for permanent pacemaker implantation
Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated in patients with symptomatic sinus node dysfunction
and HCM, and in patients with high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block who are symptomatic, or who
have arrhythmias such as AF or ventricular arrhythmias that are worsened by bradycardia or prolonged
pauses.[96] [70]
Symptomatic patients: predominantly nonobstructive with
preserved systolic function (ejection fraction ≥50%)
Patients with nonobstructive HCM commonly have dyspnea and exertional angina.[2] Symptoms are
related to diastolic dysfunction, with impaired filling resulting in reduced output and pulmonary congestion.
Presence of obstructive CAD should be excluded.[2] Patients are more symptomatic when heart rate
is higher, as diastolic filling is further compromised; a negative chronotropic agent may therefore be
beneficial in this setting.[4]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Management
MANAGEMENT
First-line options for patients with nonobstructive HCM and preserved ejection fraction are beta-blockers
or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers.[1] [2] Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are
thought to improve symptoms secondary to their beneficial effect on myocardial relaxation and ventricular
filling. They are also negative inotropes, which may aid in relief of symptoms. Beta-blockers may improve
diastolic filling due to their negative chronotropic effect.
Oral diuretics may be added to treatment in patients who have persistent dyspnea despite beta-blockers
or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers or volume overload; diuretics should be used with caution
to avoid hypotension or hypovolemia.[2] Disopyramide is not recommended, as it may decrease cardiac
output more than the other therapies in this setting. Mavacamten is not approved for use in nonobstructive
HCM; studies are ongoing.
US guidelines note that in addition to pharmacologic therapies, physical activity and control of
comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea can provide optimal
reduction of symptom burden.[2]
Surgery may be considered in highly selected patients with apical HCM and severe dyspnea or angina
despite maximal medical therapy; but this is limited to centers of excellence with the highest volumes,
surgical experience and expertise.[2]
Management of complications
Myocardial ischemia
If the patient develops symptoms or signs of ischemia, decreasing myocardial oxygen demand with
negative inotropic and chronotropic agents may prove beneficial. Etiology of the ischemia should be
identified (i.e., increased LV outflow tract obstruction, coronary artery disease, or myocardial bridging).
Surgical unroofing of myocardial bridging has been reported to yield symptomatic improvement in select
patients, but data are limited.[30] [91]
Oral nitrates can be used cautiously for relief of angina.[1] Ranolazine can be considered to improve
symptoms in patients with angina-like chest pain and no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.[1] See Chronic coronary disease
.
Ventricular arrhythmias
As in patients with LVOTO, implantation of an ICD is recommended for secondary prevention in
patients with nonobstructive HCM who have survived a cardiac arrest due to VT or VF, or who have
spontaneous sustained ventricular arrhythmia causing syncope or hemodynamic compromise in the
absence of reversible causes. It should also be considered in patients presenting with hemodynamically
tolerated VT, in the absence of reversible causes.[1] In patients with HCM and pacing-capable ICDs,
programming antitachycardia pacing is recommended to minimize risk of shocks.[2] Although data are
lacking, antiarrhythmics such as beta-blockers (e.g., sotalol) and amiodarone should be considered
for patients with recurrent, symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia, or recurrent ICD shocks.[1] Catheter
ablation in specialized centers may be considered in select patients with recurrent, symptomatic sustained
monomorphic VT (SMVT), or recurrent ICD shocks for SMVT, in whom antiarrhythmics are ineffective,
contraindicated, or not tolerated.[2] [94]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Management
Treat atrial arrhythmias, including AF, as described above for patients with predominant LVOTO, to
maintain sinus rhythm. The risk of systemic thromboembolism in patients with HCM and AF is thought
to be significant, and thus the threshold for initiation of anticoagulant therapy should be low.[1] [2] 
Anticoagulation is recommended for all patients with HCM and AF, with a DOAC first-line, and a vitamin K
antagonist (usually warfarin) second-line.[1] [2]
Indications for permanent pacemaker implantation
Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated in patients with symptomatic sinus node dysfunction and
HCM, and in patients with high-grade AV block who are symptomatic, or who have arrhythmias such as
AF or ventricular arrhythmias that are worsened by bradycardia or prolonged pauses.[96] [70]
Symptomatic patients: with systolic dysfunction (ejection
fraction <50%)
The average duration from onset of symptoms to end-stage disease is 14 years.[97] Systolic function
deteriorates, and the left ventricle remodels and becomes dilated. The mechanism of end-stage HCM is
likely diffuse ischemic injury. Risk factors for end-stage disease include younger age at diagnosis, more
severe symptoms, larger LV cavity size, and family history of end-stage disease. Mortality is high once
this complication develops, with mean time to death or cardiac transplantation of 2.7 ± 2.1 years.[97]
Medical therapy
Patients with systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <50% are treated with guideline-directed medical
therapy (GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.[2] [98] See Heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction .
Diuretics should be used cautiously in these patients compared with patients with other causes of heart
failure, due to possible impairment in preload.
US guidelines note that reduced ejection fraction is uncommon in patients with HCM, and therefore the
patient should be evaluated for other causes of systolic dysfunction.[2] Mavacamten should be interrupted
or discontinued in patients who develop LVEF <50%. Previously indicated negative inotropic agents
(verapamil, diltiazem, or disopyramide) should also be discontinued.[2]
Evaluation for mechanical circulatory support and/or heart transplantation
If patients remain refractory to medical therapy, they should be referred for consideration for heart
transplant.[2] [98] Heart transplants have been shown to improve survival and quality of life for patients
with end-stage heart failure secondary to HCM.[98] Presence of comorbidities, caretaker status, and
goals of care should all be taken into account when considering patient eligibility for transplant.[98] Left
ventricular assist device therapy may be considered as a bridge to transplantation.[2]
ICD
As described above, patients with HCM and systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <50% are
considered for ICD placement.[2]
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)
US guidelines note that in patients with NYHA functional class II to class IV symptoms despite GDMT, and
left bundle branch block, CRT can be beneficial to improve symptoms, reduce HF hospitalizations, and

considered in select patients.[2]
Considerations for additional common chronic comorbid
conditions
Lifestyle and cardiovascular disease risk modification
• Comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and sleep-disordered
breathing, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and inactivity, may increase symptom burden and
risk of heart failure and/or atrial fibrillation.[99] [100] Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease
(as per published guidelines) and management of risk factors is recommended in all (symptomatic
and asymptomatic) patients.[1] [99] [101]
• Obesity and hypertension have both been associated with increased risk of developing HCM in
genotype-negative individuals. US guidelines suggest that weight loss interventions in patients with
HCM and obesity have the potential to reduce symptoms and adverse outcomes.[99]
• When treating patients with hypertension and obstructive HCM, beta-blockers or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are preferred. Low-dose diuretics may also be
considered. Vasodilating agents may exacerbate LVOTO and symptoms.[99]
• Assessment for sleep-disordered breathing is recommended by US guidelines, with referral to
specialist if symptoms are present.[99] The guidelines suggest that management of obstructive
sleep apnea could reduce symptoms and arrhythmic complications in patients with HCM, but
evidence is needed.
• Patients should refrain from high-intensity athletics.

Treatment recommended for SOME patients in

» Patients should be considered for an ICD
if at any stage during therapy they are found
to be at a higher risk level, or develop new
symptomatic or important asymptomatic
ventricular arrhythmias.
» Guidelines recommend ICD placement for
patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM) and previous documented cardiac
arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia.[1]
[2] Comprehensive sudden cardiac death risk
stratification is recommended in all patients at
initial presentation, then at 1-2 year intervals or
whenever there is a change in clinical status.[1]
[2]
» A single marker of high risk for sudden cardiac
arrest may also be sufficient to consider ICD
placement in selected patients.[1][2] [68]
 Patients in whom this would apply include those
with one or more first-degree or close relatives
50 years or less with sudden death presumably
caused by HCM, patients with a maximum LV
wall thickness greater than or equal to 30 mm,
patients with one or more recent, unexplained
episodes of syncope suspected to be arrhythmic,
LV apical aneurysm, LV systolic dysfunction
with ejection fraction <50%, and late gadolinium
enhancement >15% on cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging.[1] [2]
» No randomized controlled trials studying the
effect of ICD placement have been performed in
patients with HCM, although there is evidence
from observational studies.[2][68]
» Complications following ICD placement have
been reported to occur at a rate of 3.4% per
year.[69] Contact sports should be avoided after
ICD implant.[70] Patients and caregivers should
be fully informed and participate in decision-
making regarding ICD placement.[2] They
should be counseled on the risk of inappropriate
shocks, implant complications, and the social,
occupational, and driving implications of the
device. Implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator
is only recommended in patients who have an
expectation of good-quality survival >1 year.[1]

» Consider addition of mavacamten (a cardiac
myosin inhibitor) for patients with LVOTO and
persistent severe symptoms despite therapy with
beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-

» In the US, mavacamten is available through
a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
(REMS) program, designed to monitor patients
periodically with echocardiograms for early
detection of systolic dysfunction and to
screen for drug interactions prior to each
prescription.[76]
» European guidelines stipulate that in
the absence of evidence to the contrary,
mavacamten should not be used with
disopyramide, but may be coadministered with
beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium-

» US guidelines recommend that disopyramide

beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blocker), as it may enhance conduction
through the atrioventricular node, which could

» If severe symptoms persist despite optimal
medical therapy, consideration should be
given to surgical myectomy, which reduces
septal mass, thereby relieving obstruction.[2]
Patients are generally considered to be eligible
for septal reduction therapy when they have
severe dyspnea or chest pain (New York
Heart Association class III or IV) or exertional
recurrent syncope, resting or provocable outflow
tract gradient of ≥50 mm Hg, and appropriate
anatomy.[1] [2] Myectomy abolishes or
substantially reduces LV outflow tract gradients
in over 90% of cases, reduces systolic anterior
motion-related mitral regurgitation, and improves
exercise capacity and symptoms. Long-term
symptomatic benefit is achieved in >80% of
patients, with a long-term survival comparable to
that of the general population.
» Preoperative determinants of a good long-
term outcome are: age <50 years; left atrial size
<46 mm; absence of AF; and male sex.[1] Older
age and increased severity of comorbidities are
predictive of poor surgical outcomes.[83]
» The rate of postoperative complications
is estimated at 5.9% in most experienced
centers. The most common complications are
complete heart block in patients without previous
conduction abnormality (3% to 10%), left bundle
branch block (40% to 56%), and ventricular
septal defect (1%).[83] [84]
» Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) may be
performed as an alternative to surgical
myectomy. ASA involves the delivery of alcohol
into a target septal perforator branch of the
left anterior descending coronary artery,
for the purpose of producing a myocardial
infarction and reducing septal thickness.[1]
Septal remodeling and relief of obstruction after
ASA occurs over several months, resulting
in a smaller reduction in resting gradient
compared with surgical myectomy, but a
similar reduction in patient symptoms.[85] [86]
 Complications include ventricular arrhythmias
(2.2%), coronary dissection (1.8%), and
complete heart block (>10%) necessitating
permanent pacemaker placement.[87]  There
is an increased need for permanent pacemaker
implantation postprocedure compared with
surgical myectomy.[88] Mortality from all-cause
or sudden cardiac death is low after ASA.[89]

of ASA and surgical myectomy are lacking, a

associated with increased long-term all-cause

This finding remained after adjustment for
confounding factors (patients undergoing
ASA tend to be older with more comorbidities

with patients undergoing septal myectomy),
but may still be influenced by unmeasured
confounders.[90]

with ischemia adjunct surgery or percutaneous coronary
intervention
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients may develop symptoms or signs
of ischemia. Ischemia in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) is multifactorial and
thus not easily treated. Decreasing myocardial
oxygen demand with negative inotropic and
chronotropic agents may prove beneficial.
» Etiology of the ischemia should be identified
(i.e., increased LV outflow tract obstruction,
coronary artery disease, or myocardial bridging).
» For patients with anomalous coronary
artery, surgical unroofing of myocardial bridge
(tunneling of coronary arteries into heart
muscle) has been reported to yield symptomatic
improvement in select patients, but data are
limited.[30] [91] Moreover, myocardial bridging
is frequently identified in HCM and has not been
conclusively linked to sudden cardiac death.[92]
[93] Therefore, the risks of the procedure
need to be considered when advising surgical
intervention.

coronary artery disease consider PCI or CABG.

also be considered in patients presenting
with hemodynamically tolerated VT, in the
absence of reversible causes.[1] In patients with
HCM and pacing-capable ICDs, programming
antitachycardia pacing is recommended to
minimize risk of shocks.[2]
» Although data are lacking, antiarrhythmics
such as beta-blockers (e.g., sotalol) and
amiodarone should be considered for patients
with recurrent, symptomatic ventricular

» Catheter ablation in specialized centers may

Treatment recommended for ALL patients in

» Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often poorly tolerated
in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM).[2] As a result, an aggressive strategy
for maintaining sinus rhythm may be warranted.
Paroxysmal or persistent AF are linked to left
atrial enlargement.[4] AF is independently
associated with heart-failure-related death,
and occurrence of fatal and nonfatal stroke, as
well as long-term progression of heart failure
symptoms. Management of AF is as per patients
without HCM. However, digoxin is not typically
used for atrial rate control if the patient has
significant hypertrophy, as there is a theoretical
concern that it could exacerbate LVOTO due
to a positive inotropic effect.[2] In addition,
traditional stroke risk scoring systems used in
the general population, such as CHA2DS2-
VASc (congestive heart failure or left ventricular

» Patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM) commonly have dyspnea
and exertional angina.[2] Symptoms are related
to diastolic dysfunction, with impaired filling
resulting in reduced output and pulmonary
congestion. Presence of obstructive coronary
artery disease should be excluded.[2] Patients
are more symptomatic when heart rate is higher,
as diastolic filling is further compromised; a
negative chronotropic agent may therefore be
beneficial in this setting.[4]
» First-line options for patients with
nonobstructive HCM and preserved ejection
fraction are beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers (diltiazem,
verapamil).[1] [2]
» Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
are thought to improve symptoms, secondary
to the beneficial effect on myocardial relaxation
and ventricular filling. They are also negative
inotropes, which may aid in relief of symptoms.
» Beta-blockers may be used, as they may
improve diastolic filling due to their negative
chronotropic effect.

with atrial fibrillation plus anticoagulation plus management of
arrhythmia
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often poorly tolerated
in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM).[2] As a result, an aggressive strategy
for maintaining sinus rhythm may be warranted.
Paroxysmal or persistent AF are linked to left
atrial enlargement.[4] AF is independently
associated with heart-failure-related death,
and occurrence of fatal and nonfatal stroke, as
well as long-term progression of heart failure
symptoms. Management of AF is as per patients
without HCM. However, digoxin is not typically
used for atrial rate control if the patient has
significant hypertrophy, as there is a theoretical
concern that it could exacerbate LVOTO due
to a positive inotropic effect.[2] In addition,
traditional stroke risk scoring systems used in
the general population, such as CHA2DS2-
VASc (congestive heart failure or left ventricular
dysfunction, hypertension, age ≥75 [doubled],
diabetes, stroke [doubled]-vascular disease,
ages 65-74 years, sex category [female])
are not predictive in patients with HCM, with
evidence suggesting that they may perform
suboptimally.[1] [2] [95]  For this reason,
although there are no randomized controlled
trials evaluating the role of anticoagulation in
patients with HCM, given the high incidence
of stroke, prophylactic anticoagulation is
recommended in all patients with HCM and
AF (if no contraindication).[1] A direct oral
anticoagulant (DOAC) is recommended first-
line option, and a vitamin K antagonist (usually
warfarin) second-line option.[1] [2] [95] See
New-onset atrial fibrillation  and Chronic atrial
fibrillation .

» The average duration from onset of symptoms
to end-stage disease is 14 years.[97] Systolic
function deteriorates, and the left ventricle
remodels and becomes dilated. The mechanism
of end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM) is likely diffuse ischemic injury. Risk
factors for end-stage disease include younger
age at diagnosis, more severe symptoms, larger
left ventricular cavity size, and family history of
end-stage disease. Mortality is high once this
complication develops, with mean time to death
or cardiac transplantation of 2.7 ± 2.1 years.[97]
» Patients with systolic dysfunction with ejection
fraction <50% are treated with guideline-directed
medical therapy for heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction.[2] [98]
» Diuretics should be used cautiously in
these patients compared with patients with
other causes of heart failure, due to possible
impairment in preload.
» Reduced ejection fraction is uncommon in
patients with HCM, and the patient should
therefore be evaluated for other causes of
systolic dysfunction.[2]
» If the patient is receiving mavacamten and
develops left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, it
should be interrupted or discontinued. Previously
indicated negative inotropic agents (verapamil,
diltiazem, or disopyramide) should also be
discontinued.[2] See Heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction .

Emerging
Research into genotype-phenotype correlation
Studies are ongoing to identify other disease-causing mutations and disease-modifying factors for HCM. This
research may serve by improving genotype-phenotype correlations and prognosis or may aid in the discovery
of therapies that can prevent or alter disease progression in gene-positive individuals. A small study found
that preclinical sarcomere mutations were associated with more prominently abnormal left ventricular
relaxation, ECG changes, mitral leaflet length, and serum pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations
in people who went on to develop HCM.[102] Another study found that patients with diagnosed HCM and
mutations in the MYBPC3 gene, which encodes cardiac myosin binding protein C, were more likely to have
impaired ventricular function and were possibly more prone to arrhythmic events than those without MYBPC3
mutations.[103]
Aficamten
Aficamten is a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor with a shorter half-life than mavacamten.[104] In a
phase 2 clinical trial, high‐dose aficamten was generally well tolerated and was associated with a 93%
response rate (defined as a final resting left ventricular outflow tract [LVOT] gradient ≤30 mmHg and Valsalva
LVOT gradient ≤50 mmHg) compared to 8% with placebo.[105] In a phase 3 trial, aficamten significantly
improved peak oxygen uptake and secondary endpoints related to symptom relief and functional status
compared with placebo, with a similar incidence of adverse events in both groups.[106] Additional trials
investigating the long-term safety and tolerability of aficamten, as well as its efficacy in patients with
obstructive HCM, are ongoing. The Food and Drug Administration has granted breakthrough therapy and
orphan drug designation to aficamten for patients with obstructive HCM.
Secondary prevention
Screening of all first-degree family members with echocardiography, ECG, and clinical follow-up is required.
All patients with HCM should:
• Be counseled about exercise (see Patient discussions ).
• Undergo serial testing with echocardiogram, Holter monitor, exercise testing, and clinical evaluation to
determine their risk level for sudden cardiac death (SCD); implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are
indicated for prevention of SCD in selected individuals at higher risk.
• Be considered for anticoagulation for stroke prevention if they develop atrial fibrillation.
• Be referred for consideration of surgical coronary unroofing if they develop ischemia due to myocardial
bridging.
Patient discussions
Patients should return for routine lifelong follow-up and seek medical attention for symptoms of exertional
chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope.
Advice should be given about exercise; whereas historical guidelines have focused predominantly on
elite young athletes and provided prohibitive recommendations, it is now well recognized that exercise
is beneficial to cardiovascular health, and light and moderate exercise should be encouraged in all able
individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). All patients with HCM, if able, should adhere to
the current minimal physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week
divided over five sessions; those who are not able to achieve this should perform symptom-limited
physical activity. Moderate exercise appears to be safe.[114] US and European guidelines now advise
that participation in high-intensity exercise/competitive sports may be considered for some individuals
after comprehensive evaluation and shared discussion with an expert.[2][65] This evaluation should
consider symptomatic status, family history, functional capacity, cardiac morphology, and risk profile. A full

complement of cardiac investigations is recommended, including an echocardiogram, exercise stress test,
cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and prolonged ECG monitor.[114]
Screening of family members should be discussed. All first-degree relatives of patients with
cardiomyopathy should be offered clinical screening with ECG and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram
and/or cardiac MRI). In families in whom a disease-causing genetic variant has been identified, cascade
genetic testing should be offered. Those relatives who have the familial genetic variant(s) should
undergo regular clinical evaluation (every 1-3 years before the age of 60 years, and then every 3-5
years thereafter) with ECG, multimodality cardiac imaging, and additional investigations (e.g., Holter
monitoring) as required. Those relatives without a phenotype who do not have the same disease-causing
variant as the proband are discharged from further follow-up but advised to seek reassessment if they
develop symptoms or if new clinically relevant data emerge in the family. When no pathogenic variant
is identified in the proband or genetic testing is not performed, regular, long-term clinical evaluation
using a multiparametric approach that includes ECG and cardiac imaging should be considered in first-
degree relatives. During cascade screening, where a first-degree relative has died, clinical evaluation of
close relatives of the deceased individual (i.e., second-degree relatives of the index patient) should be
considered.[1]
Clinical psychological support for patients and their families affected by inherited cardiomyopathies is an
important aspect of the multidisciplinary team’s care approach and should be available as required.[1]

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
In general, patients with cardiomyopathy require lifelong follow-up to evaluate changes in symptoms,
risk of adverse events, ventricular function, and cardiac rhythm.[1] A shared approach between
cardiomyopathy units and general cardiologists is strongly recommended.[1]
All patients should undergo clinical assessment and risk stratification at the time of diagnosis and at 1-2
year intervals, or whenever there is a change in clinical status.[1] [2] Such evaluation should include:
a detailed family history, with particular emphasis on whether other family members with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy experienced premature death; a detailed history with inquiry into symptoms of chest
pain, palpitations, or loss of consciousness; echocardiography; ambulatory monitoring; ECG; and
exercise testing.[2] Cardiac magnetic resonance evaluation should be considered every 2-5 years or more
frequently in patients with progressive disease.[1]
Patients with risk factors for sudden death, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on sequential
Holter monitorings, previous cardiac arrest, extreme hypertrophy, and unexplained syncope, should be
closely monitored; implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement should be considered. See Diagnostic
approach  for more information on risk stratification.
Frequent follow-up at 6-month intervals is recommended for those with high-risk features for sudden
cardiac death (SCD) and focused on mitigation of risk. It is important to note that the European
Society of Cardiology risk score was developed from cohort studies of nonathletes and it is difficult
to ascertain whether the risk of SCD is further exacerbated by the stressors associated with high-
intensity activities.[38] Therefore, further or more frequent screening strategies may be indicated in those
participating in high-intensity athletic activities, especially those that are highly dynamic start-stop type
exercises. Patients over 65 years of age may have additional prevalent cardiac comorbidities such as
hypertension and diabetes that may increase their risk.[113]

who are asymptomatic without significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).
Expert maternal/fetal medical specialist care is recommended for women on medical therapy as the drugs
may have adverse effects in the fetus.
Expert maternal/fetal medical specialist care is also recommended for women who are symptomatic or
have LVOTO >50 mmHg as symptoms may worsen due to changes in contractility, heart rate, and vascular
resistance or venous capacitance that occur with pregnancy, labor, and/or delivery.[111] [112]
sudden death short term low
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most common mode of death in young people with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM), occurring with an incidence of 1% per year.[67] The proposed mechanism of SCD
is ventricular tachycardia secondary to ischemia.[4] SCD typically occurs in the setting of extreme exertion.
Risk factors for HCM sudden death include: younger age; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on
ambulatory monitor; abnormal BP response to exercise; massive hypertrophy (left ventricular wall
thickness ≥30 mm); severe outflow obstruction on echocardiogram; family history of sudden death;
personal history of unexplained syncope; prior cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia; left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction <50%; left atrial enlargement; presence of left
ventricular apical aneurysm; diffuse and extensive late gadolinium enhancement by cardiac MRI.[1] [2] [40]
 Patients with HCM who survived a cardiac arrest and were treated with conventional medical therapy or
surgery have been shown to have a 7-year mortality rate of 33%.[29]
infective endocarditis (IE) short term low
The site of the vegetation is usually the thickened anterior mitral valve leaflet.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy no longer mandates antibiotic IE prophylaxis unless there is a history of prior
endocarditis or prosthetic valve.
ischemic stroke short term low
Atrial fibrillation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) significantly increases the risk of stroke caused by
systemic emboli.[4]
Anticoagulation is recommended for patients with HCM and atrial fibrillation, with a direct oral
anticoagulant (DOAC) first-line and a vitamin K antagonists (ususlly warfarin) second-line.[2]
Prognosis
In the majority of cases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) carries a benign prognosis. At presentation
90% of patients will be asymptomatic, and the majority of those will remain asymptomatic on long-term
follow-up. In one prospective study, the onset of any symptom was delayed until the patient was 70 years or

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Follow up

older in 18% of patients.[10] Patients presenting with mild to moderate symptoms typically experience slow
progression of symptoms with advancing age. 
In patients who are asymptomatic at presentation, the annual mortality rate is lower than in those patients
with symptoms (0.9% vs. 1.9%). Similarly, the annual rate of sudden death is lower in patients without
symptoms at presentation (0.1% vs. 1.4%).[108] See Diagnostic approach  for information about risk factors
for sudden death.
The annual mortality rate for those patients diagnosed in childhood is substantially greater than that of the
general population (1.3% vs. 0.08%). In contrast, the annual mortality rate for those diagnosed in adulthood
is not significantly increased above the general population (2.2% vs. 1.9%).[109]
End-stage heart failure develops in around 2% to 15% of people with HCM and carries a poor
prognosis.[110] Systolic function deteriorates, and the left ventricle remodels and becomes dilated. The
mechanism of end-stage HCM is likely diffuse ischemic injury. Risk factors for end-stage disease include
younger age at diagnosis, more severe symptoms, larger LV cavity size, and family history of end-stage
disease. Mortality is high once symptomatic heart failure develops, with mean time to death or cardiac
transplantation of 2.7 ± 2.1 years.[97]

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
