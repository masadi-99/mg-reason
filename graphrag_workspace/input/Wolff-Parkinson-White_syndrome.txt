Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Overview
Summary
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome occurs when myocardial fibers connect the atrium to the ipsilateral
ventricle across the mitral or tricuspid annulus (accessory pathway), pre-exciting the ventricle.
Patients often present with atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, less commonly atrial fibrillation, and, rarely,
sudden cardiac death.
Asymptomatic patients can either be monitored or screened to determine whether they have a “high-risk”
accessory pathway, in which case catheter ablation is typically performed. Screening to determine whether
a patient has a high-risk accessory pathway is recommended for patients who have high-risk occupations,
such as school bus drivers or pilots, and also for competitive athletes. In patients with asymptomatic pre-
excitation who have an accessory pathway demonstrating low risk features on invasive or noninvasive
screening, an electrophysiology study and ablation can be considered.
Symptomatic patients usually undergo catheter ablation as first-line therapy. Pharmacologic therapy can
be considered for patients in whom catheter ablation fails and also for patients who prefer a noninvasive
approach.
Catheter ablation is highly effective with low risk and can be used either as initial therapy or for patients
experiencing side effects or arrhythmia recurrences despite medical treatment.
Definition
Occurs when one or more strands of myocardial fibers capable of conducting electrical impulses (known
as accessory pathways [APs] or bypass tracts) connect the atrium to the ipsilateral ventricle across the
mitral or tricuspid annulus.[1] Conduction from the atrium reaches the adjacent ventricle earlier via the AP,
and a part of the ventricle is pre-excited. The term "Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome" is restricted
to symptomatic patients with a typical ECG abnormality, whereas the term "WPW pattern" signifies an
asymptomatic patient with typical ECG abnormalities.[2]

THEORY
Epidemiology
The exact prevalence of ventricular pre-excitation is difficult to estimate because most patients are
asymptomatic. Intermittent pre-excitation and loss of pre-excitation over time also add to the challenge. The
prevalence of WPW-pattern ECG in the general population is 0.1% to 0.3% increasing to 0.55% among
first-degree relatives of affected patients.[3] [5] [6] The yearly incidence is 0.004% to 0.1% (50% of these
are asymptomatic). The male-to-female ratio is 2:1.[7] [8] Signs of pre-excitation were absent in the initial
ECG in 22% of subjects with WPW-pattern ECG and 40% of these lost pre-excitation on subsequent ECG
recordings.[7] The prevalence of WPW syndrome varies with the population studied. In a review of 22,500
healthy aviation personnel, the WPW pattern was seen in 0.25%; however, only 1.8% of these patients had
documented arrhythmias. It can be encountered at any age, but the highest incidence is in the third and
fourth decades of life.[9] In a report of 228 subjects with WPW syndrome, the overall incidence of arrhythmia
was 1% per year during a 22-year follow-up.
Etiology
WPW pattern on ECG arises from a developmental cardiac defect in the atrioventricular (AV) electrical
insulation at the AV groove due to the presence of an accessory pathway (AP). These APs are usually
single epicardial strands of tissues that travel across the AV groove to connect the atrium and the adjacent
ventricular myocardium. Less commonly, they are multiple hair-like strands or a broad band of tissues.
Rarely, these muscle bands extend over coronary sinus diverticula or may connect right atrial appendage
to the anterior right ventricle. The anatomic distribution of APs is: 40% to 60% left lateral; 20% right or left
posteroseptal area; 13% to 21% right free wall; and 2% to 10% anteroseptal area. Unlike the AV node, where
conduction slows at faster rates of stimulation (decremental conduction) approximately 90% of APs are
rapidly conducting, resulting in circus movement tachycardia involving the atrium and ipsilateral ventricle with
the AP as one limb and AV node as another limb of the circuit (AV re-entrant tachycardias). Approximately
10% of the APs in WPW syndrome are slowly conducting (decremental).
The presence of APs can be associated with various disorders. Ebstein anomaly is a malformation of the
tricuspid valve and right ventricle characterized by adherence of the septal and posterior tricuspid leaflets
to the underlying myocardium, apical displacement of the tricuspid annulus, and dilation of the atrialized
portion of the right ventricle. Other rare associations include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve
prolapse, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, transposition of the great vessels, coarctation of
the aorta, dextrocardia, coronary sinus diverticula, right and left atrial aneurysms, cardiac rhabdomyomas
(as seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis), Marfan syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Pompe disease, Danon
disease, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Most cases of WPW are not due to a genetic cause and genetic
testing is only relevant if there is pre-excitation in combination with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and/or
progressive cardiac conduction disease. In these patients, the underlying gene PRKAG2 has been identified
as a potential cause, resulting in cardiac glycogen storage abnormalities.[10]
The incidence of multiple APs (2 to 5) in patients with WPW syndrome is 5% to 13%.[11] Multiple APs are
more commonly observed in patients with a family history of WPW syndrome, Ebstein anomaly, or other
congenital heart diseases (10% to 20%).[10] [12] Multiple APs are associated with a higher incidence of
antidromic reciprocating tachycardia and a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death.

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Theory
Pathophysiology
Normal conduction from the atria to the ventricles occurs via the atrioventricular (AV) node (where minor
physiologic delay occurs) and His-Purkinje system, resulting in a normal PR interval and a narrow QRS
complex. In WPW syndrome, because of the physiologic delay of conduction in the AV node, conduction from
the atrium reaches the adjacent ventricle initially via the accessory pathway (AP), which normally has no
conduction delay, and a part of ventricle is pre-excited, resulting in a slurred upstroke at the initiation of the
QRS complex, known as the delta wave. The terminal portion of the QRS complex is narrow, as conduction
via the AV node to the His-Purkinje system reaches the remainder of the ventricles.
The degree of pre-excitation depends upon the relative contributions of ventricular activation via the AP
versus the His-Purkinje system. It is typically greater for patients with a right-sided AP as compared with a
left free-wall AP due to the relative time differences for engaging the AP when the electrical impulse leaves
the sinus node. Conduction over the AP results in shortening of the PR interval (<120 ms) and widening of
the QRS complex (>110 ms) with secondary ST-T wave changes. During atrial fibrillation (AF), which occurs
in up to one third of patients with WPW syndrome, rapid anterograde conduction via the AP to the ventricle
may rarely cause ventricular fibrillation (VF) that may result in sudden cardiac death.
When an AP is capable of retrograde conduction only (from the ventricle to the atria), the sinus rhythm
ECG is normal and no delta wave is seen (concealed AP). These APs can serve as the retrograde limb of
orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT).

• AV re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT): AVRT is the most common arrhythmia and occurs in approximately
70% to 80% of patients with WPW syndrome.[3] [4] The common form of AVRT involves impulse
conduction via the AV node, down the His-Purkinje system to the ventricles anterogradely, and the
AP retrogradely, resulting in rapid atrial activation after ventricular depolarization. This is known as
ORT. Less commonly (5% to 10%), AVRT results from impulse conduction in a direction opposite to
ORT: that is, conduction from atrium to ventricle via the AP and then from the ventricle to the atrium via
the His-Purkinje system and the AV node. Therefore, it is a regular wide complex tachycardia (WCT),
because ventricular activation is transmyocardial rather than via the specialized conduction tissue.
This type of AVRT is known as antidromic reciprocating tachycardia (ART). ART is relatively more
frequent in patients with multiple APs as compared with those with a single AP and is also relatively
less common in patients with septal APs.

• ORT: AVRT occurs in 70% to 80% of patients with WPW syndrome.[4] During ORT, the impulses reach
the ventricles via the normal conduction system (AV node and His-Purkinje system) and then return
to the atrium via the AP as soon as ventricular depolarization reaches the valve annuli. Tachycardia
more commonly starts after a premature atrial complex that blocks at the refractory AP but is able to
conduct down the AV node to the ventricles. By this time, the AP recovers and the impulse reaches the
atrium via the AP and then travels to the ventricles via the AV node, to continue as ORT. During ORT
the ventricle is depolarized via the normal conduction system; ORT is a narrow complex tachycardia
with a short RP interval (short RP tachycardia).

complex that blocks in the AP and conducts retrograde via the AV node. The baseline ECG (upper
panel) of a patient with minimum pre-excitation and the WCT (lower panel) is an ART with negative
delta wave in inferior leads and lead V1 suggestive of a right inferoseptal AP as shown here. The
ART is a wide QRS tachycardia and therefore can be confused with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) or
a supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. The baseline ECG is the key in most cases. If there
is positive QRS concordance (QRS polarity positive in all precordial leads due to annular location
of the APs) during ART, then this may mimic a VT. However, if there is negative concordance (QRS
polarity negative in all precordial leads), then an ART is ruled out - except for a rare AVRT involving
an atriofascicular pathway, which has AV node-like property that connects the tricuspid annulus to the
distal right bundle and results in a left bundle branch block configuration WCT.

Classification
Manifest AP versus concealed AP
Accessory pathways (APs) in WPW syndrome are usually capable of conducting bidirectionally (atrium to
ventricle and ventricle to atrium). When an AP is capable of conducting retrogradely only (from the ventricle
to the atria), the sinus rhythm ECG is normal and no delta wave is seen (concealed AP).

These APs serve as a substrate for re-entry and can cause a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) involving
the AV node as the other connection between the atrium and the ventricle. This type of SVT is termed
atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT). An increased risk of sudden cardiac death is observed in
patients with antegradely conducting APs but not in those with concealed APs.[3]
Asymptomatic/symptomatic patients
Symptomatic patients are those with episodes of tachycardia. The severity of symptoms can vary widely
based on the frequency of episodes, whether they self-terminate, and the rate of the tachycardia. In
general, faster tachycardias result in more severe symptoms than slower tachycardias. Tolerance is
related to the rate of SVT as well as the patient's subjective experience. The decision about whether to
advise electrophysiology (EP) testing and catheter ablation should be based largely on the presence of
any symptoms. Because by definition all patients with WPW syndrome are symptomatic (as opposed to

asymptomatic with pre-excitation on ECG) they should all be referred for baseline diagnostic EP testing, and
catheter ablation should be offered if appropriate based on the results.
The management of patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation is comparatively more complex. It is well
established that sudden cardiac death can be the first manifestation of an accessory pathway. Approximately
one fifth of patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation will develop a symptomatic arrhythmia over time.
And very rarely this can be sudden cardiac death. It is for this reason that the 2019 European Society of
Cardiology guidelines have a large set of recommendations for managing patients with asymptomatic pre-
excitation. It is recommended that an electrophysiology study (EPS) with isoproterenol should be considered
to risk stratify individuals with asymptomatic pre-excitation and is recommended in individuals who are
athletes or have a high risk occupation. If high risk electrophysiologic properties are identified, catheter
ablation is recommended. In addition, an EPS and ablation can be considered in patients with asymptomatic
pre-excitation who have an AP demonstrating low risk features on invasive or noninvasive screening.[3]
Atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT)
AVRT is the most common arrhythmia and occurs in approximately 70% to 80% of symptomatic patients with
WPW syndrome.[4]
Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT): during ORT, the ventricle is depolarized via the normal
conduction system; ORT is a narrow complex tachycardia most commonly with a short RP interval (short RP
tachycardia).

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Diagnosis
Approach
It is unusual to have Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern as an incidental finding in healthy people who
get ECG recording done for a routine health checkup. When managing patients with a WPW pattern on an
ECG, the clinician should consider two main points: first, assessment of symptoms that may be due to the
accessory pathway (AP) (e.g., palpitations, periods of fast heart rates, syncope or near-syncope); second,
assessing the risk of sudden cardiac death.
Acute presentations
Patients with an acute arrhythmia due to WPW may present with palpitations, dizziness, shortness
of breath, chest pain, and/or sudden cardiac death. The most common arrhythmias diagnosed are
atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. Sudden cardiac death and
syncope are associated outcomes but rare. ECG should be recorded in any patients with suspected
supraventricular arrhythmia.
Congenital cardiac abnormalities
From 7% to 20% of patients with WPW syndrome have other accompanying congenital abnormalities.
The most common is Ebstein anomaly, which is associated with single or multiple right-sided APs.
Other rare associations include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, atrial septal defect,
ventricular septal defect, transposition of the great vessels, coarctation of the aorta, dextrocardia,
coronary sinus diverticula, right and left atrial aneurysms, cardiac rhabdomyomas (as seen in patients
with tuberous sclerosis), Marfan syndrome, and Friedreich ataxia. Echocardiogram can be used to
diagnose these.

Locating APs
The precise localization of APs helps in assessing the success rate and risks for catheter ablation,
and in planning the ablation strategy. For example, left-sided APs are often ablated via a transseptal
approach, and paraseptal APs, which are close to the His bundle, are associated with a risk for complete
atrioventricular block during catheter ablation (some electrophysiologists now prefer cryoablation for APs
close to the His bundle; see the treatment section).
Several algorithms have been developed, but, as a general rule, a positive delta wave (first 40 ms of QRS
complex) in lead V1 suggests a left-sided AP and a negative delta wave in V1 suggests a right-sided AP.
A positive delta wave in the inferior leads suggests an anterior AP. A left axis (with a negative delta wave
in lead V1) suggests a right lateral AP. If the delta waves in the inferior leads are negative, then it denotes
an inferior AP. A negative delta wave in lead I, aVL, and V6 (rightward QRS axis) with a positive delta
wave in lead V1 suggests a left lateral pathway. It is prudent to recognize that the delta wave vector can
only be determined with precision when the ECG shows maximum pre-excitation.

Risk stratification
Patients with WPW pattern should be risk stratified with noninvasive and invasive tests, and those
who are low risk should be monitored for any future arrhythmia. It is recommended that invasive risk
stratification should be considered for all patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation and is strongly advised
in all patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation who are competitive athletes or who have a high risk
occupation. If a high risk AP is observed at the time of electrophysiology study (EPS), then catheter
ablation is advised.[3] Therefore, asymptomatic patients should be referred to an electrophysiologist or
a cardiologist with expertise in arrhythmia evaluation for risk stratification. While controversy exists, most
experts recommend that all patients with ventricular pre-excitation undergo risk stratification to determine
their risk of sudden cardiac death, regardless of the presence of symptoms.[15] [16]
The risk of sudden cardiac death is determined by the anterograde refractory period of the AP. The
presence of multiple APs and inducible tachycardia have also been identified as risk markers.
• If the refractory period is very short, there are multiple APs, or tachycardia is induced, patients are
at risk for developing symptomatic arrhythmias and also ventricular fibrillation in the setting of atrial
fibrillation conducting rapidly over the AP. Shorter anterograde refractory periods are associated
with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death because the AP can conduct impulses more rapidly
to the ventricles. This is particularly important if the patient develops atrial fibrillation. Normally, the
ventricles are "protected" from rapid depolarization due to the decremental properties of the AV
node. However, in patients with an AP with a short anterograde refractory period, rapid conduction
over the AP can lead to rapid ventricular rates that can deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation.
• If ventricular pre-excitation is intermittent at rest, this suggests the anterograde refractory period is
relatively long, and the AP is low risk for causing sudden cardiac death.
• If ventricular pre-excitation is always present at rest, patients should be referred to an
electrophysiologist to determine whether invasive risk stratification is warranted. If patients do
not want to undergo an electrophysiology study, exercise stress testing can be used as a risk
stratification tool.
• Abrupt loss of pre-excitation during exercise is indicative of an AP incapable of dangerously rapid
conduction from the atrium to the ventricle, and is considered to be a marker of a lower-risk AP.
If pre-excitation does not abruptly disappear with exercise, then invasive risk stratification with an
electrophysiology study should be considered.

History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) (common)
• The most common arrhythmia is AVRT, which occurs in approximately 70% to 80% of patients.[3] [4]
Other diagnostic factors
palpitations (common)
• Presenting feature of an acute arrhythmia due to WPW.
dizziness (common)
• Presenting feature of an acute arrhythmia due to WPW.
shortness of breath (common)
• Presenting feature of an acute arrhythmia due to WPW.
chest pain (common)
• Presenting feature of an acute arrhythmia due to WPW.
atrial fibrillation (common)
• Atrial fibrillation and flutter occur alone in 16% of patients and in 20% of patients with atrioventricular
re-entrant tachycardia. Typically the heart rate varies between 150 and 240 bpm.
atrial flutter (common)
• Atrial fibrillation and flutter occur alone in 16% of patients and in 20% of patients with atrioventricular
re-entrant tachycardia. Typically the heart rate varies between 150 and 240 bpm.
congenital cardiac abnormalities (common)
• From 7% to 20% of patients with WPW syndrome have other accompanying congenital abnormalities.
The most common is Ebstein anomaly, which is associated with single or multiple right-sided
accessory pathways.
sudden cardiac death (uncommon)
• The following factors are considered high risk for sudden cardiac death, especially in patients with
a history of syncope: fastest rate ≥225 bpm during atrial fibrillation; anterograde refractory period
≤270 ms; multiple accessory pathways. The risk of cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation in patients with
untreated WPW syndrome is approximately 0.9-2.4 per 1000 person-years.[4]
syncope and presyncope (uncommon)
• Usually with a history of palpitations and dizziness. Syncope is an uncommon presentation (incidence
<5%) of WPW syndrome. Most of these episodes are believed due to neurocardiogenic syncope. It
could rarely be a manifestation of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or a self-terminating
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which occur secondary to the rapid
ventricular rates due to anterograde conduction via the accessory pathway.

Tests

Test Result
12-lead ECG
• ECG should be recorded in any patients with suspected
supraventricular arrhythmia. Intermittent pre-excitation is defined
by the electrocardiographic presence of QRS complexes with
pre-excitation intermingled with narrow QRS complexes due to
conduction solely via the atrioventricular (AV) node (without pre-
excitation). Sometimes, pre-excited QRS complexes alternate with
the narrow QRS complex because of a long refractory period of the
AP. Intermittent pre-excitation indicates that the AP is incapable of
conduction to the ventricle fast enough to pose a risk for ventricular
fibrillation during rapid atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or
flutter. An algorithm of delta wave polarity in 12-lead ECG or during
antidromic tachycardia has been developed.
• Twelve-lead ECG at baseline shows no delta waves and short RP
tachycardia during the clinical arrhythmia in AV nodal re-entrant
tachycardia.

Criteria
WPW syndrome versus WPW-pattern ECG
WPW syndrome or pre-excitation syndrome occurs when one or more strands of myocardial fibers capable
of conducting electrical impulses (known as accessory pathways or bypass tracts) connect the atrium to the
ipsilateral ventricle across the mitral or tricuspid annulus.[1] A patient who is asymptomatic but with typical
WPW ECG abnormalities is referred to as having WPW pattern.
Asymptomatic/symptomatic patients
Symptomatic patients are those with episodes of tachycardia. The severity of symptoms can vary widely
based on the frequency of episodes, whether they self-terminate, and the rate of the tachycardia. Tolerance
is related to the rate of supraventricular tachycardia as well as the patient's subjective experience.
Screening
Family members are not commonly screened.

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Management
Approach
Treatment of acute presentations is based on the nature of the arrhythmia. Ongoing treatment is decided
according to the symptoms of the patient as well as risk stratification for sudden cardiac death.
Acute management
Acute management follows a path by whether the patient is stable or unstable; and if stable, by whether
they are in orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia (narrow complex with short RP
tachycardia), antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia (wide complex tachycardia), or whether they have
atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia.[3][20]
Patients with an acute tachycardia and who are hemodynamically unstable (BP <90/60 mmHg, with signs
of systemic hypoperfusion) or who have atrial fibrillation with >250 bpm, or in whom the atrial fibrillation
has degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, require immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion.
AV reciprocating tachycardia
Narrow complex (orthodromic AV reciprocating) tachycardia:
Because orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia involves the AV node as one limb of the circus movement
tachycardia, any maneuver or drug that slows or interrupts conduction in the AV node can terminate
the tachycardia. In a hemodynamically stable patient, vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage
should be performed at the bedside, or alternatively, patients can be instructed to perform a Valsalva
maneuver to terminate the arrhythmia. If this fails, pharmacotherapy with intravenous adenosine, AV nodal
blocking drugs, or antiarrhythmic agents is indicated.
Adenosine is preferred because of its ultra-short half-life (<18 seconds). It should be given as a rapid
intravenous injection in a central vein or in the antecubital vein, followed by 10 to 20 mL of rapid normal
saline flush. It can be used a second time if there is no response. Adenosine injection may cause chest
pain, chest tightness, bronchospasm, dizziness, and a short run of atrial fibrillation (1% to 15%). Although
atrial fibrillation is usually transient, it can cause rapid conduction to the ventricle via the accessory
pathway (AP), and if the conduction is rapid then it can potentially result in ventricular fibrillation.
Therefore, resuscitation equipment should be available as a standby. Adenosine should be avoided in
patients with severe asthma and patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug. In addition, adenosine
injection is associated with a higher risk of heart block in patients on carbamazepine therapy.
AV nodal blocking drugs (diltiazem, verapamil, metoprolol) can be used when there is no response or a
recurrence after carotid sinus massage and adenosine. Antiarrhythmic drugs (procainamide, ibutilide,
amiodarone) can be used when there is no response or a recurrence after carotid sinus massage,
adenosine, and AV nodal blocking drugs.
Rapid atrial pacing using a temporary pacemaker for overdrive suppression of the tachycardia can be
used if previous drug treatments fail. DC cardioversion can then be used when symptoms persist in
patients or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.
Wide complex (antidromic AV reciprocating) tachycardia:
If the tachycardia is hemodynamically stable, then management of antidromic reciprocating tachycardia is
with intravenous adenosine or antiarrhythmic drugs.

MANAGEMENT
Adenosine is preferred because of its ultra-short half life (<18 seconds). It can be used a second time if
there is no response.
Antiarrhythmic drugs (procainamide, ibutilide, amiodarone) can also be used when there is no response
or a recurrence after adenosine.
Calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, and beta-blockers are contraindicated in this population, because
these drugs slow the conduction via the AV node but do not have any effect on the AP. This may result in
a rapid conduction via the AP, which may cause ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading
to sudden cardiac death.
Rapid atrial pacing using a temporary pacemaker for overdrive suppression of the tachycardia can be
used if previous drug treatments fail. DC cardioversion can then be used when symptoms persist in
patients or if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.
Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia
Pre-excited tachycardia results in a rapid irregular wide complex tachycardia with varying duration and
amplitude of QRS complexes depending upon the degree of pre-excitation. Intravenous infusions of
antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide or ibutilide, which prevent rapid conduction through the AP,
are used, even though they may not be able to terminate the atrial arrhythmia.[3] [20]
Anticoagulation should be considered in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter depending on the presence of
comorbid cardiologic abnormalities and duration of onset.
Rapid atrial pacing using a temporary pacemaker for overdrive suppression of atrial flutter or atrial
tachycardia can be used if the previous drug treatments fail. Rapid atrial pacing has no role in atrial
fibrillation.
DC cardioversion can be used when symptoms persist in patients or if the patient becomes
hemodynamically unstable. However, the recurrence of atrial arrhythmia after DC cardioversion may be
higher in atrial tachycardia, compared with atrial fibrillation/flutter, depending on the mechanism. If the
atrial tachycardia is related to abnormal automaticity, DC cardioversion may not be effective at all, such as
in multifocal atrial tachycardia.

Atrial fibrillation in a patient with WPW syndrome with rapid
ventricular rate; resulted in aborted sudden cardiac death

Asymptomatic
While controversy exists, most experts recommend that all patients with ventricular pre-excitation
undergo risk stratification to determine their risk of sudden cardiac death, regardless of the presence
of symptoms.[4] [15] [16] [21] The risk of sudden cardiac death is determined by the anterograde
refractory period of the AP during an isoproterenol infusion.[3] The presence of multiple APs and inducible
tachycardia have also been identified as risk markers.

testing looking for abrupt loss of pre-excitation, again indicative of an AP incapable of dangerously

exercise, invasive risk stratification with an electrophysiology study should be considered. APs

considered for catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is generally not performed in pregnant patients
and should be deferred until after delivery.
Symptomatic patients
Symptomatic patients usually undergo catheter ablation as a first-line therapy.[3] [4]
Antiarrhythmic drugs are one of the therapeutic options for the management of symptomatic WPW
syndrome, but they have been increasingly replaced by catheter ablation.
AV nodal blocking drugs are generally avoided in patients with WPW syndrome or WPW pattern because
they theoretically can speed conduction through the AP. If antiarrhythmic drug therapy is chosen, a
class 1C antiarrhythmic medication (flecainide or propafenone) or amiodarone is generally preferred.
Class I antiarrhythmic agents (flecainide or propafenone) are suitable for patients with no additional
cardiac disease but cannot be used in people with coronary artery disease or structural heart disease. In
patients with coronary artery disease or structural heart disease, class III antiarrhythmic agents (sotalol,
amiodarone, or dofetilide) may be used. QT interval must be determined prior to starting therapy with
dofetilide as it is contraindicated if corrective QT interval (QTc) is >440 milliseconds (>500 milliseconds in
patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities).
The incidence of symptomatic tachycardia is reported to be higher during pregnancy, which may be
refractory to drugs that are safe to use in such circumstances. Therefore a radiofrequency ablation
should be considered prior to the next planned pregnancy. Catheter ablation is generally not performed in
pregnant patients and should be deferred until after delivery. In the event a patient with WPW syndrome
becomes pregnant prior to ablation of their AP, and if frequent recurrences of supraventricular tachycardia
are observed during pregnancy, it is reasonable to treat the patients with flecainide or propafenone.[3]

MANAGEMENT
Acute
stable: narrow complex (orthodromic
atrioventricular reciprocating)
tachycardia
1st carotid sinus massage or Valsalva
maneuver
» Because orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia
involves the atrioventricular (AV) node as one
limb of the circus movement tachycardia, any
maneuver or drug that slows or interrupts
conduction in the AV node can terminate the
tachycardia. In a hemodynamically stable
patient, vagal maneuvers such as a carotid sinus
massage should be performed at the bedside,
or, alternatively, patients can be instructed to
perform a Valsalva maneuver to terminate the
arrhythmia.
2nd intravenous adenosine or atrioventricular
(AV) nodal blocking drugs or
antiarrhythmics
Primary options
» adenosine: 6 mg intravenously initially,
followed by 12 mg intravenously in 1-2
minutes if required
Secondary options
» diltiazem: 0.25 mg/kg (average adult dose
20 mg) intravenously initially, followed by
0.35 mg/kg (average adult dose 25 mg)
intravenously in 15 minutes if required
OR
» verapamil: 2.5 to 5 mg intravenously
initially, followed by 5-10 mg (or 0.15 mg/kg)
intravenously in 15-30 minutes if required,
maximum 30 mg/total dose
OR
» metoprolol tartrate: 2.5 to 5 mg
intravenously every 2-5 minutes as needed,
maximum 15 mg/total dose
Tertiary options

as a rapid intravenous injection in a central vein
or in the antecubital vein, followed by 10-20 mL
of rapid normal saline flush. It can be used a
second time if there is no response.
» Adenosine injection may cause chest pain,
chest tightness, bronchospasm, dizziness,
and a short run of atrial fibrillation (1% to
15%). Although atrial fibrillation is usually
transient, it can cause rapid conduction to the
ventricle via the accessory pathway, and if
the conduction is rapid then it can potentially
result in ventricular fibrillation. Therefore,
resuscitation equipment should be available
as a standby. Adenosine should be avoided in
patients with severe asthma and patients with a
known hypersensitivity to the drug. In addition,
adenosine injection is associated with a higher
risk of heart block in patients on carbamazepine
therapy.
» AV nodal blocking drugs (diltiazem, verapamil,
metoprolol) can be used when there is no
response or a recurrence after carotid sinus
massage and adenosine.
» Antiarrhythmic drugs (procainamide, ibutilide,
amiodarone) can be used when there is no
response or a recurrence after carotid sinus
massage, adenosine, and AV nodal blocking
drugs.
3rd rapid atrial pacing
» Rapid atrial pacing using a temporary
pacemaker for overdrive suppression of the
tachycardia can be used if previous drug
treatments fail.
4th direct-current (DC) cardioversion
» In patients whose symptoms persist
despite pharmacotherapy or atrial pacing, DC
cardioconversion should be used.

1st risk stratification and monitoring
» While controversy exists, most experts
recommend that all patients with ventricular pre-
excitation undergo risk stratification to determine
their risk of sudden cardiac death, regardless of
the presence of symptoms.[15] [16] [21]
adjunct catheter ablation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Asymptomatic patients in specialized jobs
with particular safety issues (e.g., airline pilot,
school bus driver) can be considered for catheter
ablation. Catheter ablation is also performed in
asymptomatic patients who are found to have
a “high-risk” accessory pathway at the time of
electrophysiology testing, showing high-risk
antegrade conduction characteristics.[3] [20]
» Catheter ablation is generally not performed in
pregnant patients and should be deferred until
after delivery.
following acute treatment:
symptomatic
1st catheter ablation
» All patients should be offered catheter ablation.
» The incidence of symptomatic tachycardia is
reported to be higher during pregnancy, which
may be refractory to drugs that are safe to use in
such circumstances. Therefore a radiofrequency
ablation should be considered prior to the
next planned pregnancy. Catheter ablation is
generally not performed in pregnant patients and
should be deferred until after delivery.

weeks, followed by maintenance dose of
200-400 mg/day
OR
» dofetilide: 125-500 micrograms orally twice
daily
» Used in patients who refuse ablation or in
whom ablation is unsuitable.
» Class I antiarrhythmic agents (flecainide or
propafenone) are suitable for patients with no
additional cardiac disease but cannot be used in
people with coronary artery disease or structural
heart disease.
» In patients with coronary artery disease or
structural heart disease, class III antiarrhythmic
agents (sotalol, amiodarone, or dofetilide) may
be used.
» In the event a patient with WPW syndrome
becomes pregnant prior to ablation of their
accessory pathway, and if frequent recurrences
of SVT are observed during pregnancy, it is
reasonable to treat the patients with flecainide or
propafenone.[3]
» QT interval must be determined prior
to starting therapy with dofetilide as it is
contraindicated if QTc is >440 msec (>500
msec in patients with ventricular conduction
abnormalities).
Patient discussions
Patients should visit their physician every 2 to 3 years for monitoring.
Patients should call the emergency services if they have any recurrence of symptoms.

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients should visit their physician every 2 to 3 years for monitoring.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
sudden cardiac death (SCD) variable low
Usually with a history of palpitations and dizziness. SCD due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a rare
manifestation with an incidence of 0.025% to 0.38%. The risk of cardiac arrest/VF in patients with
untreated WPW syndrome is approximately 0.9-2.4 per 1000 person-years.[4] High-risk patients include
those with a rapidly conducting accessory pathway (AP) (1:1 AV conduction at >250 bpm) and multiple
APs. WPW syndrome accounts for 10% of SCD in the young population.[25] The mode of death is
thought to be due to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response via an AP that induces polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia and VF resulting in syncope or SCD. Although syncope in patients with WPW
syndrome is considered an ominous prognostic sign, in one study of patients with WPW syndrome
referred for electrophysiology study, the incidence of aborted SCD was 28% and 16% in patients with and
without a history of syncope, respectively. However, this did not reach statistical significance.
catheter ablation complications variable low
Catheter ablation is generally a safe procedure with an overall complication rate of 4.4% and a major
complication rate of less than 1%.
The common minor complications are related to the vascular access, catheter manipulation, transseptal
atrial puncture for left-sided accessory pathway ablation, application of radiofrequency energy, and left-
sided ablation: bleeding from vascular sites, hematomas, deep venous thrombosis, arteriovenous fistula,
pseudoaneurysm at the arterial access sites, pneumothorax, infection.
The risk of major complications is 1.8%: death, related to catheter manipulation, due to valvular damage,
perforation of the coronary sinus or myocardial wall, coronary artery dissection, and thrombosis
(0.08% to 0.2%), or related to the delivery of radiofrequency energy (atrioventricular block, 0.17% to
1.0%), myocardial perforation, coronary artery spasm or occlusion, transient ischemic attacks and
cerebrovascular accidents, or pericardial tamponade (0.13% and 1.1%), mostly occurs during transseptal
puncture, but can occur during the application of radiofrequency energy.
Prognosis
Symptomatic patients with WPW syndrome should undergo catheter ablation as a first-line
therapy.[17] Catheter ablation has a high efficacy and low risk, and can be used either as initial therapy or for
patients experiencing side effects or arrhythmia recurrence during drug therapy. Patient preference is always
an important consideration in these scenarios. Subjects with WPW pattern (asymptomatic patients), except
for those with specialized jobs, should not be treated but can be monitored for symptoms.

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
