Patent ductus arteriosus Overview
Summary
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus arteriosus, a vascular fetal structure that usually
closes in the first 48 hours after birth, fails to close.
Persistence of the ductus arteriosus can result in heart failure, increased pulmonary pressures, and
endarteritis.
The incidence and sequelae of a PDA are more significant in premature infants than infants born at full-term.
Clinical history and presentation can vary significantly depending on age of the child and the size of
the ductus. Patients may be entirely asymptomatic or have signs and symptoms of heart failure and
hemodynamic instability.
Treatment options vary depending on the age of the patient and the size of the ductus. Practice may vary
significantly between institutions.
Definition
PDA describes the persistence of a fetal vascular structure, known as the ductus arteriosus, after birth. The
ductus arteriosus connects the main pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing blood to bypass the lungs in
utero. It usually closes in the first 48 hours of life.[1]

Patent ductus arteriosus Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The persistence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is much more common in preterm than full-term
infants.[2] This is secondary to the immaturity of the ductus.[3] Since the advent of echocardiography, the
incidence of PDA in children born at full-term has been reported as approximately 1 to 2 per 1000.[4] This
estimate is higher than previously thought because it includes clinically silent PDAs.[5] There is globally a
higher incidence in females as well as in children born at higher altitudes.[6] [7] In the US, incidence is higher
in black children compared with white children.[4]
In premature infants, the incidence is substantially greater. Studies in the US have shown an incidence
as high as 20% in premature infants weighing <1750 g and 64% in those weighing <1000 g.[8] [9] In the
Republic of Korea, the prevalence of PDA in infants is 81 per 10,000 live births, with the annual prevalence
increasing from 70 per 10,000 in 2015 to 94 per 10,000 in 2018, especially in term infants. Very-low-birth-
weight infants in the Republic of Korea also had a reported PDA prevalence of 47.25% in 2018 (an increase
of 5.6% from 2015).[10] Research indicates that socioeconomic disparities can delay the diagnosis of
PDA and access to care, which, in turn, affects neurodevelopment outcomes, underscoring the need for
addressing these disparities to improve long-term outcomes for affected children.[11]
Etiology
In the fetus, the ductus arteriosus diverts cardiac output away from the lungs towards the placenta to support
systemic oxygenation.[12] The fetal ductus has intrinsic tone and its patency is maintained by a low-oxygen
environment and dilating factors (circulating prostaglandins produced by the placenta [PGE2 and PG12],
nitric oxide, adenosine, atrial natriuretic peptide, carbon monoxide, and potassium channels).[12] [13] After
birth, systemic oxygen saturation increases with the onset of breathing, contributing to the constriction of the
ductus through potassium-mediated channels.[14] [15] Postnatally, the level of circulating prostaglandins
falls as the placenta is removed from the circulation. In addition, pulmonary blood flow increases, resulting
in increased metabolism of prostaglandins. There may be several other unknown factors that contribute to
ductal closure.[13] [16] Hemodynamic constriction is later followed by complete structural closure mediated
by histologic changes that obliterate the ductal lumen.[17]
While the process of ductal closure is fairly well understood, the factors that result in persistence of the
ductus are less clear. Emerging research reveals that genetic predisposition and intrauterine inflammation
play critical roles in affecting the neurodevelopment of children with congenital heart disease, indicating a
significant interplay between genetic and environmental factors in brain development.[11] The incidence of
patent ductus arteriosus (i.e., an open ductus beyond the first 3 postpartum days) exceeds 50% in preterm
infants ≤28 weeks’ gestational age.[12] In preterm infants, there may be a decreased response to oxygen
and a continued sensitivity to prostaglandins compared with full-term infants, in addition to generalized
immaturity of the smooth muscle.[12] [18] [19] On histologic exam, differences between the tissue of
a persistent ductus versus a physiologic ductus have been noted and suggest an anatomic reason for
persistence.[17]
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology occurs as a result of shunting of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery across
this persistent vascular connection. After birth, pulmonary vascular resistance falls, while systemic resistance
remains unchanged, leading to left to right shunting through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The degree

Patent ductus arteriosus Theory
of shunting, and thus the clinical presentation, depends on both the systemic to pulmonary artery pressure
ratio and the size of the ductus.[20] A small ductus in the setting of near systemic pulmonary pressures will
have limited flow. However, a larger ductus will have less resistance to flow and will initially be associated
with a greater degree of shunting as pulmonary resistance falls in the newborn period. This will result in
an increase in left ventricular volume, increased left ventricular output, and pulmonary overcirculation.[21]
Increased blood flow to the lungs leads to decreased pulmonary compliance and increased work of
breathing. With the increased preload, the left ventricle dilates and left ventricular end diastolic pressures and
left atrial pressures increase. The increase in left-sided cardiac pressure inhibits pulmonary venous return,
furthering pulmonary congestion.
The effects of pulmonary overcirculation and systemic steal are most pronounced in preterm infants.
Increased pulmonary blood flow not only leads to pulmonary edema, but also to pulmonary hemorrhage,
respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[22] [23] [24] [25] Decreased systemic
perfusion may be responsible for the increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular
hemorrhage seen in preterm infants with PDA.[26][27] Additionally, a large PDA can impact myocardial
perfusion by decreasing diastolic blood pressure. This, along with the shorter diastolic time caused by
compensatory tachycardia, can reduce coronary artery blood flow.[28]
Classification
Small, moderate, or large
• If the ductus is widely patent, such that the vessel itself provides no resistance to flow, then it is
considered large. The amount of shunting across a large patent ductus arteriosus will be dependent
upon the relative pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. A large ductus is usually of equal or
greater diameter than one of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries.
• A moderate-sized ductus will provide some resistance to flow. However, the amount of shunting will be
great enough to result in some degree of left atrial dilation.
• A small ductus will significantly restrict flow such that there will be no dilation of the left atrium or left
ventricle.
Overt or silent
While some patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may present with overt clinical features, others
may present with no signs or symptoms; this is referred to as a silent PDA. A murmur is absent. The ductus
becomes evident as an incidental finding when an echocardiogram is performed for another purpose. There
has been some controversy over the treatment of a silent PDA.
Case history
Case history #1
A 6 week-old infant girl is brought to her pediatrician with poor feeding. Since she was last seen at 2
weeks she has had poor weight gain. She sweats with feeds and seems to tire out easily. There is no
significant family history. On physical exam she is noted to be tachypneic and uninterested in her bottle
after a few minutes of feeding. She has increased work of breathing. On cardiac exam, she has a grade 4
continuous murmur that is heard in the left infraclavicular region and back. She also has an early diastolic

rumble best heard at the apex. Her liver is 3 cm below her costal margin. Her pulses are bounding.
Her chest x-ray (CXR) reveals an enlarged heart with a prominent main pulmonary artery segment and
increased pulmonary markings.
Case history #2
A 28 week premature boy is treated with appropriate doses of surfactant. However, on his second day of
life he has worsening symptoms of respiratory distress syndrome with increasing ventilatory requirements.
He has also started demonstrating apneic episodes. He is noted to have a widened pulse pressure (30
mmHg) on his arterial line and he is starting to have some bloody stools. On physical exam, he is noted
to have bounding pulses and a prominent precordial impulse. On auscultation a grade 3 systolic ejection
murmur can be heard in the left infraclavicular area. His abdomen also appears distended. On CXR, his
lung fields are almost completely opacified.
Other presentations
Clinical presentation depends on the age of the patient and the size of the shunt. Patients can be
completely asymptomatic, have significant heart failure, or, if they present much later in life, may have
signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. Premature infants with a hemodynamically significant
patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) usually develop clinical signs in the first week of life. Full-term infants with
a PDA may present in early infancy with a murmur, or signs of heart failure if they have a large shunt
across the ductus. Conversely, they may not present until late childhood with mild exercise intolerance if
the shunt is smaller. Hemodynamically insignificant shunts will not be associated with symptoms but may
be picked up by the presence of a murmur on exam. Atypically, if a hemodynamically significant PDA is
missed in childhood, it may present in adulthood with heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, endarteritis, or, most
seriously, with irreversible pulmonary vascular disease characterized by desaturation and evidence of
right heart failure.

Patent ductus arteriosus Diagnosis
Approach
Clinical history and presentation can vary significantly depending on the age of the child and the size
of the ductus. Patients may be entirely asymptomatic or have signs and symptoms of heart failure and
hemodynamic instability.
History
The clinical history varies depending on the age of the patient and the size of the shunt.
In premature babies the clinical history can be somewhat nonspecific. They can have worsening
respiratory status with tachypnea and/or apnea and increased ventilation requirements. They can also
have circulatory instability associated with low diastolic blood pressure (BP), which may mimic sepsis.
In full-term infants and children with a small patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) there may be no significant
clinical history.
With a moderate or large PDA, infants may present with nonspecific symptoms such as tachypnea,
irritability, poor feeding, diaphoresis, and failure to gain weight. They may be prone to increased
respiratory symptoms with upper respiratory infections. An older child or adult may present with shortness
of breath and exercise intolerance.[40] [41]
Physical examination
Irrespective of size, PDA in the newborn is associated with a murmur heard only during systole. However,
the murmur later becomes more continuous in nature.
• Small ductus: on cardiac exam, there is usually normal precordial activity with a normal S1 and
S2. A continuous murmur is best heard in the second left intercostal space. It may radiate to the
back. The murmur is accentuated late in systole and continues into diastole.[42] The lung exam
and respiratory rate are usually normal.
• Moderate or large ductus: these children usually have a hyperdynamic precordium. A systolic thrill
may sometimes be palpable in the upper left sternal border. The first and second heart sounds
are sometimes masked by the murmur. A third heart sound is often heard at the apex. There may
also be a mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apex. The peripheral pulses are often bounding. On
respiratory exam, these children may be tachypneic. If they are in heart failure they may have
pulmonary rales.
On BP measurement there may be a widened pulse pressure if the ductus is large.
Diagnostic testing
If there is concern for a PDA based on clinical findings, a chest x-ray (CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG)
may be helpful in providing information with regard to the presence or absence of a clinically significant
shunt. The definitive diagnostic test is an echocardiogram.[33][41]
CXR
A CXR in a patient with a moderate or large, hemodynamically significant ductus will demonstrate an
enlarged heart and increased pulmonary vascular markings. The main pulmonary artery segment will be
prominent. Left atrial dilation, best seen on the lateral film, will be present. In patients with smaller shunts,
the CXR can be completely normal.

DIAGNOSIS
ECG
During early infancy, the ECG is often normal. However, in older infants and children, it may demonstrate
left ventricular enlargement, with a deep Q wave and tall R waves in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6. Left
atrial enlargement with widened P waves may also be seen. Findings are nonspecific, as they can be
seen with other left-sided shunts such as ventricular septal defects. In patients with smaller shunts, the
ECG can be completely normal.
Echocardiogram
The definitive test to confirm diagnosis is an echocardiogram.[33] [43] In children, this should be
performed by a sonographer trained in congenital heart disease (CHD) in conjunction with a pediatric
cardiologist; alternatively, a referral to a pediatric cardiologist should be made.[44] Echocardiography
can confirm the presence and size of the ductus as well as the direction of shunting. It is important to
determine the direction and velocity of the shunt in order to understand the degree of ductal resistance
and relative systemic to pulmonary pressure. Left heart chamber dimensions can be evaluated to
determine the significance of the duct. In the early days of echo, sensitivity was 96% and specificity was
100% compared with angiography.[45] However, in the present era, with echo’s improved capabilities, it is
accepted as 100% sensitive, with angiography and catheterization reserved for treatment purposes only.

Early prenatal detection of CHD through echocardiography enables timely planning for neuroprotective
strategies during neonatal care, which may alleviate some neurodevelopment impacts associated with
CHD.[11]

Cardiac catheterization and angiography
Cardiac catheterization with angiography is usually not necessary for the diagnosis of an uncomplicated
PDA. The role of this procedure in most cases is the facilitation of closure via transcatheter occlusion. If
used diagnostically, it provides evidence of the presence and severity of shunt and allows assessment of
any associated pulmonary hypertension.

Emerging tests
One Cochrane review found that a simple blood assay for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or amino-
terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) had moderate accuracy in the diagnosis of
hemodynamically significant PDA. However, the studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of these
assays varied considerably by assay characteristics and patient characteristics; hence, generalizability
between centers is not possible and further studies are needed.[46]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
presentation in infancy (common)
• A large patent ductus arteriosus most often presents as pulmonary resistance falls, usually before 2-3
months of age. Diagnosis in adolescence or adulthood is much more unusual but does occur.
Other diagnostic factors
tachypnea/shortness of breath (SOB) (common)
• In moderate or large patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary overcirculation often results in increased
work of breathing and SOB. In older children, this SOB can sometimes be mistaken for reactive
airways disease.

DIAGNOSIS
faltering growth (common)
• In moderate or larger patent ductus arteriosus, faltering growth is a common presenting symptom for
infants.
exercise intolerance (common)
• In moderate or larger patent ductus arteriosus, exercise intolerance is a common presenting symptom
for older children.
widened pulse pressure (common)
• With a hemodynamically significant shunt, a widened pulse pressure can be detected by blood
pressure measurement or by palpation of bounding pulses. In preterm infants, bounding pulses are a
poor independent predictor for the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus.[47]
machine-like continuous murmur/Gibson murmur in children born at full-
term (common)
• This classic murmur, known as a Gibson murmur or machinery murmur, is best heard in the left
infraclavicular area, peaks in late systole, and continues through into diastole.[42] However, some
patients with a higher pulmonary pressure in diastole may have a murmur that is confined to systole.
The lack of a continuous murmur does not rule out a patent ductus arteriosus.[2] A murmur is a less
reliable sign in preterm infants, with high specificity but poor sensitivity.[47]
apnea (common)
• May be a symptom in premature infants.
low diastolic blood pressure (BP) (common)
• Low diastolic BP with circulatory instability may mimic sepsis in preterm infants.
irritability (common)
• This is a nonspecific symptom in full-term infants and children.
diaphoresis (common)
• This is a nonspecific symptom in full-term infants and children.
increased respiratory symptoms with upper respiratory infection (common)
• Full-term infants and children are prone to these infections.
murmur heard only during systole (common)
• This is a sign in newborns, irrespective of the size of the ductus.
hyperdynamic precordium (common)
• This is a sign in children with a moderate to large ductus.
systolic thrill (common)
• A systolic thrill may be palpable in the upper left sternal border. This is a sign in children with a
moderate to large ductus.

• Can be heard as a result of pulmonary edema or venous congestion secondary to higher left atrial
pressures.
Risk factors
Strong
prematurity
• The relationship between delayed closure of the ductus arteriosus and prematurity has long been
recognized.[29] The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in all preterm infants is about 8 per
1000 births, which is almost 10 times that seen in full-term infants.[2] This increases with decreasing
gestational age and birth weight, with an incidence as high as 20% in preterm infants weighing <1750
g and 64% in preterm infants <1000 g.[8] [9] Gestational age is related to ductal sensitivity to oxygen
and prostaglandins, with a decreased reaction to oxygen and an increased sensitivity to prostaglandins
seen in more premature infants.[19] Prematurity is also associated with generalized immaturity of
the smooth muscle.[12] There is some evidence that the use of prophylactic protein-free synthetic
surfactant in preterm infants may increase the risk of PDA.[30]
maternal rubella
• Maternal rubella infection in the first trimester is associated with an increased incidence of patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA).[31] While maternal rubella is associated with several congenital heart
lesions, PDA is the most common, seen in up to 50% of cases in some early series.[32] The persistent
ductus in these patients is histologically akin to an immature ductus.[33] The mechanism of this
relationship is not well understood.
female#sex
• Seen predominantly in females. In one series, 64% of patent ductus arteriosus occurred in females (a
ratio of almost 2:1).[6]
Weak
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
• There appears to be an association between severe RDS and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), as a
much higher incidence of PDA is seen in premature infants ill with RDS.[25] PDA is also associated
with a 4.5-fold increase in the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and prolonged exposure
to PDA is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary vascular disease in preterm infants.[23][34]

Patent ductus arteriosus Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
 While the direction of this relationship would seem to implicate PDA as a causal factor, the decreased
oxygenation occurring as a result of RDS and lung pathology may result in decreased metabolism of
prostaglandins, thereby contributing to the continued persistence of the duct. This raises the possibility
that PDA could instead be a consequence of RDS.[35]
high altitude
• Children living at higher altitudes have a higher prevalence.[7] In addition, the effect of altitude is
progressive, with lower ambient oxygen levels likely contributing to persistence of the ductus.
family history
• Development is multifactorial with evidence for a genetic contribution in certain cases. Siblings of
patients are at increased risk (3%) of the defect.[36] There is an increased occurrence with certain
syndromes such as trisomy 21, 4p, and Holt-Oram syndrome.[33] In addition, Char syndrome,
autosomal dominant inheritance of patent ductus arteriosus, is sometimes seen.[37] Other
investigators have found a recessive gene locus that may be associated.[38]
black race
• In the US, there is a racial differential, with a higher incidence found in black children compared with
white children.[4]

and hypertrophy will result in deep Q waves and tall R waves in leads
II, III, aVF, and the left precordial leads (V5 and V6). Significant left
atrial enlargement may manifest as widened P waves.[2] These ECG

Differentiating tests
Venous hum • A venous hum can be
heard usually more on
the right side. In addition,
it diminishes with supine
positioning and with local
compression.
• Physical exam will
distinguish a venous hum as
described previously. If there
is still sufficient concern,
echo can be performed. In
the case of a venous hum,
the echo will be normal.
Coronary artery fistula • This murmur is also
continuous. However, it is
usually heard lower in the
precordium.[2]
• Can be distinguished by
echo. On echo evaluation, a
coronary fistula will appear
as a small continuous jet of
flow into the right ventricle
or main pulmonary artery.
It can be distinguished by
location.
Left-sided shunts
(ventricular septal defect,
atrioventricular septal
defect)
• These lesions can present
similarly with regard to
clinical history, ECG, and
CXR findings. However, the
murmur of most left to right
shunts will only be heard
in systole. The exception
is an aortopulmonary
window, which is a large
connection between aorta
and pulmonary artery, and
will present with clinical
findings identical to that
of a large patent ductus
arteriosus.
• Echo can definitively
distinguish these lesions
by their characteristic
appearance and location.
Left heart enlargement, if
present, will look similar in all
these lesions.
Aortic regurgitation • These patients often present
at an older age. They can

Patent ductus arteriosus Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Screening
Premature infants
Screening is usually reserved for preterm infants. As early as 1989, it was found that early screening
and treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDAs) in this population might be advantageous.[48] Centers
differ in practice, with some centers routinely screening for PDA by echo for infants less than a certain
gestational age and weight (<28 weeks or <1000 g) at 2 to 3 days of life. This is due to concerns about the
limited value of clinical exam in diagnosis, and the perceived benefits of early treatment.[47] Some centers
prefer to prophylactically treat without any screening to confirm the diagnosis, although evidence for this is
controversial.[49] [50]

Patent ductus arteriosus Management
Approach
The main goal of treatment in premature infants is to prevent morbidity and mortality secondary to
hemodynamic instability and comorbidities such as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular
hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis.[24] [26][27] As a result, there are different treatment strategies for
premature infants, full-term infants/children, and adults. Integrating family-centered care into the treatment
plan for children with PDA is crucial, promoting parental involvement in care routines and development
support to foster a neurodevelopmentally stimulating environment. Perioperative care for children undergoing
surgical correction of PDA should focus on maintaining hemodynamic stability and adequate cerebral
oxygenation, with anesthesia protocols designed to minimize potential brain injury.[11]
Premature infants
A great deal of controversy remains over how, when, and if to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in
premature infants.[53] Four main management approaches can be differentiated:[54]
1. Early targeted prophylaxis (<24 hours)
2. Targeted therapy of asymptomatic infants (<6 days after birth)
3. Symptomatic treatment when the PDA becomes hemodynamically relevant (≥6 days after birth)
4. Late symptomatic treatment after watchful waiting OR rescue treatment after previously failed
treatment.
Treatment options include medical therapy, conservative management, surgical intervention, or
percutaneous catheter device closure. The cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin, given
intravenously, has been the mainstay of medical treatment since pharmacotherapy for PDA was
introduced to clinical practice.[54] COX inhibitors work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. New
formulations; however, such as oral and intravenous ibuprofen, and oral and intravenous acetaminophen,
have now increased the range of treatment options. Furthermore, use of COX inhibitors is declining in
favor of watchful waiting (conservative management).[54] Surgical ligation or percutaneous catheter
device closure may be considered if initial medical treatment fails.
Early targeted prophylaxis - indomethacin
Prophylactic indomethacin involves treatment with indomethacin at 0 days of life before a PDA becomes
clinically evident. The first dose is usually started within the first 12 hours of life. It is usually reserved
for very low birth weight infants (the cut-off varies between centers, but is normally <1300 g or <1000
g). Cochrane reviews have found that it decreases the rate of PDA, the need for surgical ligation for
PDA, and the rate of intraventricular hemorrhage in this population.[50] [55] [56] [57]  However, no
difference has been reported in mortality rate, incidence of morbidities such as necrotizing enterocolitis
and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or long-term neurosensory outcome.[55] [57] Infants being treated with
indomethacin must have electrolytes, creatinine, urine output, and platelets monitored regularly during
administration. Feeds are withheld. Complications can include necrotizing enterocolitis, bleeding, or renal
dysfunction.[58] [59]
Medical treatment - ibuprofen or indomethacin
Medical treatment is first-line for preterm infants in whom ductus has become clinically evident or has
been diagnosed by echo and should be initiated within the first few days of life.
• Ibuprofen: while indomethacin was previously the standard of care, ibuprofen is now largely
considered the pharmacotherapy of choice due to its similar efficacy but significantly better safety

profile.[60] [61] [62] [63] One Cochrane review comparing both oral and intravenous ibuprofen
with indomethacin found a decreased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and transient kidney injury in
patients treated with ibuprofen, with similar effectiveness between interventions.[60]  Both ibuprofen
and indomethacin have been shown to reduce the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage,
although indomethacin appears to be more effective, hence why it is used in preference to
ibuprofen as a prophylactic treatment in very low birth weight babies.[57] Studies suggest that
high-dose ibuprofen may increase the likelihood of PDA closure compared to standard-dose
ibuprofen.[57] [60] [64] [65] High-dose ibuprofen may therefore be considered the preferred dosage;
however, significant caution should be exercised in preterm infants younger than 26 weeks due
to a lack of data in this age group.[61] Studies have reported that oral ibuprofen is as effective as
intravenous (IV) ibuprofen, with no significant difference in morbidity demonstrated.[60] [66] [67]
 More recently, an overview paper, which summarized the evidence from 16 Cochrane Reviews of
randomized controlled trials, found that oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure
than IV ibuprofen in preterm infants.[57]
• Indomethacin: treatment with indomethacin has shown to be successful in closing symptomatic
PDAs compared with placebo.[8] [68] While some centers practice a prolonged course of
indomethacin (>4 and usually 7 doses), no significant difference has been shown in successful
PDA closure, need for retreatment, need for surgical ligation, or such outcomes as mortality and
the incidence of comorbidities such as chronic lung disease or necrotizing enterocolitis with this
longer regimen.[69] B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)-guided treatment has been shown to reduce
the number of primary indomethacin doses in infants with PDA.[70] In one small study, subsequent
indomethacin doses were withheld if a 12-hour or 24-hour BNP level after the first dose was <100,
with no difference in PDA persistence found between the groups.[70]
If the first course of ibuprofen or indomethacin is unsuccessful, a second course is usually given prior to
consideration of procedural closure.[61]
Conservative management
Conservative management may be considered as an alternative to medical treatment in certain
circumstances. The Canadian Paediatric Society makes a conditional recommendation for conservative
management of symptomatic PDA in the first 1-2 weeks post-birth.[61] One systematic review and meta-
analysis found no significant differences in morbidity or mortality in clinical trials assessing conservative
management compared to pharmacologic or surgical treatment in preterm infants.[71] One Cochrane
review had similar findings, with early (<7 days old) or very early (<72 hours old) empiric treatment of
PDA no more effective than conservative management in mortality or morbidity outcomes (including
development of chronic lung disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, or
neurodevelopmental abnormalities).[72] One subsequent multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial
reported that the risk of morbidity or mortality was similar in patients treated with ibuprofen, compared
with placebo.[73] Another multicenter randomized controlled trial found that expectant management
for PDA in extremely premature infants was noninferior to early ibuprofen treatment with respect to
necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or death at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age.[74]
Conservative management in preterm infants may involve diuretic therapy, increasing positive airway
pressures, and fluid restriction, although these approaches have not been systematically assessed
in clinical trials.[61] [63] [75] [76] Significant caution should be exercised if considering conservative
management in high-risk preterm infants (e.g., those younger than 26 weeks).[61]

Patent ductus arteriosus Management
Surgical ligation is usually reserved as a second-line treatment when medical treatment has failed
or is contraindicated.[61] [77] It can be performed on premature infants as small as 600 g. Surgical
ligation of the duct generally has very high success rates, with low associated morbidity.[58] [78]
 Complications are rare and include recanalization of the duct, pneumothorax, effusion, hemorrhage,
and wound infection.[79] While one study did show a relatively high late mortality in preterm infants,
this was felt to be related to the high risk inherent in this population, rather than to the surgery itself.[80]
There has been some inquiry into the favorability of surgical ligation as first-line management in this
population.[81] [82] However, there are currently limited data to allow for adequate comparison of the
two treatment approaches.[81]  One review suggested that there may be little benefit to prophylactic
surgical ligation compared with no therapy or medical therapy, with no significant decrease in mortality or
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.[83] Another review refuted earlier postulations that primary surgical ligation
may decrease the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.[84] Videothorascopic surgical ligation is being
used with increasing frequency in selected cases with good results.[85]
Percutaneous catheter device closure
Transcatheter closure of PDA in preterm and extremely low birth weight infants is becoming more feasible
and less complicated with the advent of smaller devices and smaller delivery sheaths. In practice, this is
becoming a more common second-line therapy for ductal closure than surgical ligation in most academic
centers.[61] [63] Catheter devices include coils, the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder, the Rashkind umbrella
device, and the Gianturco-Grifka occlusion device.[86] Choice of device depends on ductal morphology
and operator choice during the procedure.[87] Patients are given subacute bacterial endocarditis
prophylaxis for 6 months after the procedure, or longer if turbulent flow persists around the device.[88]
Full-term infants and children
The goal of treatment in this group is to alleviate or prevent heart failure and to prevent increased
pulmonary pressures with a significant shunt. With smaller shunts or silent PDAs, the goal of treatment is
the prevention of endarteritis through routine closure. However, this remains controversial. Any infant or
child who is symptomatic usually has closure as soon as possible.
Percutaneous catheter device closure
First-line treatment in this group of patients is catheter device closure if patients are of sufficient size, as it
avoids surgery and can usually be done with just a day admission or overnight hospital stay. Safe device
closure has been reported in patients as young as 6 months and as small as 5 kg.[89] Transcatheter
closure is also usually reserved for small or moderate size ducts, although with newer devices, larger
ducts have been able to be treated with increasing efficacy.[90] If infants are asymptomatic, the procedure
is often delayed until they are close to 1 year of age. In children >1 year, the procedure can be scheduled
at the time of diagnosis, either electively or as needed, depending on their symptoms and left heart
overload. The procedure has an extremely high success rate of >95% with no mortality and few
complications.[91] [92] Complications can include coil embolization, persistent turbulent flow around
the device, and residual leak.[92] [93] Complications are more likely to occur in smaller children.[93]
There are several types of device that can be employed for catheter closure and choice of device usually
depends on the morphology of the duct.[87]
Diuretics
Patients who present with symptoms outside of the neonatal period may not be large enough to undergo
percutaneous device closure at the time of presentation. Provided that the child is gaining weight

adequately, diuretic therapy with furosemide may be used on a temporary basis to improve symptoms and
allow the patient to reach a suitable size for percutaneous intervention.
Surgical ligation
Surgical ligation in full-term infants and children is usually reserved for ducts that are too large for closure
with a transcatheter device, or for symptomatic infants whose physical size and anatomy are thought to
be too small for transcatheter device closure. However, the exact size below which transcatheter device
closure is felt to be unsuitable may vary with clinician and institution.[89] [94] If the patient is symptomatic,
surgical ligation is undertaken as soon as possible. If asymptomatic, ligation can be scheduled electively.
Success is high with few complications that can include operative pneumothorax, hemorrhage, effusion,
or long-term recanalization.[78] [80] With increased percutaneous device closure experience, smaller
and younger children are being taken to the catheterization imaging, so referral for surgical ligation is
decreasing in infants younger than 6 months, although this is dependent on institution.[89] [94]
Adults
Percutaneous catheter device closure or surgical ligation
In certain adults with PDA, closure may be necessary if there is significant left to right shunt and/or
pulmonary hypertension. Surgical or catheter-based closure is recommended, provided that pulmonary
vascular resistance is not prohibitively high.[41] [95] [96] Currently, most advocate closure via a
transcatheter device in adults with a small to moderate patent ductus; this method has been shown
to be safe and effective in this population.[97] [98] Concerns regarding ductal tissue friability in adults
with larger PDAs have led some centers to pursue video-assisted thoracic surgery ligation, with good
results.[99]

Patent ductus arteriosus Management
MANAGEMENT
Acute
pneumothorax, hemorrhage, effusion, or long-
term recanalization.[78] [80]
» With increased percutaneous device closure
experience, smaller and younger children are
being taken to the catheterization laboratory,
so referral for surgical ligation is decreasing in
infants younger than 6 months, although this is
dependent on institution.[89] [94]
adults
1st percutaneous catheter device closure
» In certain adults with patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA), closure may be necessary if there is
significant left to right shunt and/or pulmonary
hypertension. Surgical or catheter-based closure
is recommended, provided that pulmonary
vascular resistance is not prohibitively high.[95]
[96] Currently, most advocate closure via a
transcatheter device in adults with a small to
moderate patent ductus; this has been shown to
be safe and effective in this population.[97] [98]
» Catheter devices include coils, the Amplatzer
Piccolo Occluder, the Rashkind umbrella
device, and the Gianturco-Grifka occlusion
device.[86] Choice of device depends on ductal
morphology and operator choice during the
procedure.[87] Patients are given subacute
bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for 6 months
after the procedure, or longer if turbulent flow
persists around the device.[88]
2nd surgical ligation
» In certain adults with PDA, closure may be
necessary if there is significant left to right shunt
and/or pulmonary hypertension. Concerns
regarding ductal tissue friability in adults with
larger patent ductus have led some centers to
pursue video-assisted thoracic surgery ligation,
with good results.[99]

Patent ductus arteriosus Management
Emerging
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen has been investigated as an alternative pharmacologic treatment to indomethacin or
ibuprofen in preterm infants. One systematic review found no significant difference in PDA closure
rates between acetaminophen and ibuprofen or indomethacin; however, acetaminophen caused fewer
adverse effects, with a significantly reduced risk of oliguria and a tendency towards less gastrointestinal
bleeding.[101] Another systematic review found a lack of high quality evidence to recommend
acetaminophen as a primary treatment for PDA.[102]  An overview of 16 Cochrane Reviews found that all
available drug therapies, that is, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen (specifically when given early),
were effective in closing a PDA in preterm infants. The evidence on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen
on severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was very uncertain (whereas indomethacin and ibuprofen were
both found to reduce severe IVH).[57] Further study is warranted before acetaminophen can be adopted as
the standard of care.[61] [63]
Primary prevention
There are currently no recognized strategies for primary prevention. There is some literature that suggests
that the use of antenatal corticosteroids may decrease the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus in premature
infants, though there are other risks to the infant associated with this intervention that may outweigh this
benefit.[39]
Patient discussions
Patients previously required infective endocarditis prophylaxis for dental procedures. However, US and
European guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
because of the small number of cases of infective endocarditis felt to be prevented by antibiotic use.[88]
[128] In contrast, after catheter closure with a device, patients should observe infective endocarditis
prophylaxis for 6 months until the device is endothelialized. Additionally, patients will need to continue to
observe infective endocarditis prophylaxis if there is a residual shunt near the device.[88]
Patients with an untreated small PDA with normal left chamber size can participate in all levels of
competitive sports. Those with a more significant shunt and left heart enlargement should undergo
definitive closure prior to partaking in competitive athletics. They may return to full participation 3 months
after closure if they have a normal cardiac exam without evidence of left ventricular enlargement or
elevated pulmonary pressures. If patients demonstrate elevated pulmonary resistance (pulmonary
pressures greater than 30 mmHg), individual recommendations for levels of physical activity must be
undertaken.[129]
As patients transition from adolescent to adult care, it is important to provide education on self-
management and to help them build their medical knowledge. It is important, for example, to ensure
that they are equipped with the skills needed to make medical appointments and refill prescriptions,
and that they understand the importance of lifestyle interventions such as weight management and
nonsmoking.[130]

Patent ductus arteriosus Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
With the increased use of echocardiography, incidental detection of asymptomatic patent ductus
arteriosus (PDA) is increasing, leading towards a wide variation in the timing of follow-up and
recommended testing in patients with PDA. Generally, patients with a PDA are followed by a pediatric
cardiologist with serial echocardiograms. In infants this is often done fairly regularly at 3-month intervals.
In older children, follow-up is less frequent (and often closure is scheduled before a follow-up visit). After
closure, most patients are seen for follow-up at 1 month, and again between 6 months to 1 year. Most
institutions will then discharge patients unless there is a residual lesion. Because long-term experience
with catheter closure is more limited than with surgical ligation, some practitioners will continue to follow
up these patients every 2 years. In patients with isolated PDA without extracardiac comorbidities, a
less conservative approach has been suggested. The American College of Cardiology recommends
that patients with trivial or “silent” isolated PDA be discharged from cardiology care without requiring
proof of closure. Patients with small PDAs may be monitored infrequently in clinic (every 2-3 years) for
development of left heart dilation. Patients who have had surgical closure of PDA, and have no clinical
concerns, can be discharged from cardiology follow-up after a suitable interval.[127]
The management of developmental delays in children with PDA should include early referrals to
developmental specialists and targeted interventions, such as physical, occupational, and speech
therapies, alongside early educational support to address specific developmental needs.[11]
Premature infants will need to be observed for a longer period as the ductus may reopen in some
patients. However, they are often followed clinically by their primary physician or neonatal specialist.

Patent ductus arteriosus Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) short term high
There also appears to be an association with severe RDS, with a much higher incidence of PDA seen in
premature infants ill with RDS.[25]
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants short term medium
This complication is usually limited to premature infants with increased hemodynamic instability. Left to
right shunting at the level of the ductus can lead to systemic steal. This can result in hypoperfusion of end
organs including the gut. The presence of a ductus has been found to be independently associated with an
increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.[27] Treatment varies from medical therapy with gut rest to
surgical intervention. Prevention is attempted by not feeding premature infants who have suspected patent
ductus arteriosus, and by attempting medical or surgical closure of significant ducts.
pulmonary hemorrhage in premature infants short term low
Isolated to premature infants, pulmonary hemorrhage can result from increased pulmonary blood flow.
This was directly related to the size of the duct in one study.[22]
pulmonary hypertension (HTN) long term low
A large nonrestrictive patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can lead to the eventual development of pulmonary
hypertensive disease in patients if left untreated. This occurs because of chronic volume and pressure
overload on the pulmonary circulation that can lead to irreversible vascular changes. Symptoms of
pulmonary HTN in children are frequently subtle, which can result in delayed diagnosis. In infants, poor
feeding, tachypnea, tachycardia, and poor growth are common. Physical signs may include a loud split
second heart sound, right ventricular heave, gallop, and holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation.[52]
 Elevated pulmonary pressures may eventually lead to right to left shunting through the duct, resulting
in cyanosis, shortness of breath, and clubbing (Eisenmenger syndrome). Edema of the face, hands,
and ankles, and hepatomegaly, are later signs of right-sided heart failure.[52] Chest radiography may
provide clues as to the degree of shunting; congested vasculature is often seen in large left-to-right
intracardiac shunts. Oligemia may be present in patients with restricted blood flow, such as those with
Eisenmenger syndrome. However, radiographic findings do not always correlate with disease severity.[52]
 Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line cardiovascular imaging modality for the diagnosis and
monitoring of pulmonary HTN. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance
imaging) are also used in diagnosis and management. Cardiac catheterization is considered the gold
standard for measuring hemodynamics in patients with congenital heart disease and pulmonary HTN,
especially to assess operability; duct occlusion to determine the feasibility of closure of patent ductus
arteriosus can be performed during the procedure.[52] For patients with pulmonary HTN and PDA, early
repair and elimination of the shunt is paramount to reduce the overall burden of cardiovascular disease;
the pulmonary HTN may be reversible with timely treatment of the PDA.[52] [121] In those patients with
irreversible pulmonary HTN, treatment options are limited to medical therapy, including oxygen and
pulmonary vasodilators.
congestive heart failure (CHF) variable medium
An untreated patent ductus with a significant shunt can result in symptoms of CHF. When and if CHF
occurs depends on the size of the shunt and the degree of volume overload on the heart. While larger
shunts may present in infancy, more moderate shunts may not present until later in childhood or into
adulthood.[32] Once symptoms of heart failure are noted, patients can initially be managed medically with
digoxin and diuretic therapy until the ductus can be dealt with definitively, either by catheter closure or
surgical ligation.

Patent ductus arteriosus Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
depression variable medium
The challenges associated with living with congenital heart disease can lead to depression and anxiety
in as many as one half of patients. Early-life stressors such as time in intensive care units and other
traumatic healthcare experiences can also have a significant impact.[126]
Psychological care should be a routine part of congenital heart disease treatment, with access given to
psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy where needed.[126]
endarteritis variable low
Prior to surgical and catheter closure, the incidence of infective arteritis associated with the lesion was as
high as 1% per year.[32] However, in the current era this has decreased dramatically to almost negligible
numbers of case reports.[116] When they occur, vegetations usually form on the pulmonary end of the
duct as a result of turbulent flow, and can result in pulmonary emboli. If suspected, endarteritis can be
diagnosed by transthoracic or transesophageal echo. Treatment usually consists of long-term antibiotics
followed by definitive closure of the duct.
aneurysm of the duct variable low
A ductal aneurysm is an enlargement of the ductal tissue near the point of attachment to the aorta. It is
thought to be related to abnormal elastin/ductal tissue. The reported incidence varies significantly from
1.5% to 8%.[122] [123] It usually presents in infancy but has been reported in adults.[124] While some of
the aneurysms resolve on their own, complications such as thromboses or rupture can occur.[123] [125]
The presence of a ductal aneurysm often points to an underlying connective tissue disorder. Spontaneous
resolution of ductal aneurysms in infancy has been reported. If persistent or discovered at a later age,
surgery is recommended.
Prognosis
The prognosis of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) depends largely on the size and magnitude of the
shunt and the status of the pulmonary vasculature. Many patients with small ductus arteriosus never
have signs of significant hemodynamic impairment and, other than the risk of endarteritis, have a normal
prognosis. Those patients with significant left heart volume overload; however, are at risk of congestive heart
failure or irreversible pulmonary vascular disease, even if asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during
childhood.[33]
Premature infants
Premature infants with a clinically significant persistent PDA are at risk of increased mortality compared
with infants of a similar gestational age and birth weight without PDA.[104] [105] One study found that those
with a persistent significant PDA (despite attempted closure) had four times the risk of death compared
to premature infants without a significant PDA.[106] These infants also suffer from increased morbidity
related to the effects of increased pulmonary blood flow (pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD], and pulmonary hypertension) and systemic undercirculation
(hypotension, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and acute kidney injury) due to left-to-
right shunting.[22] [23][24] [27][54][107] [108] [109] [110] The risk of mortality and morbidity appear to be
similar regardless of whether the infant is managed expectantly or with early pharmacologic therapy.[74]
[111] [112] [113] Emerging data suggest that the duration of exposure to a clinically significant PDA, rather
than simply the presence or absence of a shunt, is the more important risk factor for development of
BPD.[63] Infants who require surgical ligation generally have a worse outcome; this may be due to the fact
that this is a more severely compromised patient population.[114] [115] [116][117]

Patent ductus arteriosus Follow up
Full-term infants and children
Prior to the era of antibiotics, surgery, and catheter closure, natural history studies demonstrated risk of
death as 0.42% per year (ages 2 to 19 years), 1% per year (20 to 29 years), and 1.8% per year (30 to 39
years).[32] The estimated risk of endarteritis has been estimated at 0.45% per year for an untreated duct.[32]
With current treatment strategies, mortality and endarteritis occur rarely.[118] Spontaneous closure of a
patent ductus after 3 months of age is relatively rare. If a significant shunt is left untreated, it can result in
the development of pulmonary obstructive disease that can manifest as early as 15 months of life. A more
moderate untreated shunt may not present with such symptoms until later in life. In patients with smaller
ducts, the risk of morbidity is very low and is mainly related to the risk of endarteritis. Clinically silent PDAs
appear to carry a relatively low risk for endarteritis with only a few case reports in the literature.[119] [120]
 However, most patients, regardless of shunt size, are now referred for either catheter or surgical closure.
Overall prognosis of these patients is very good after closure; typically patients are well and the procedure
is considered curative. However, there are rare instances where increased pulmonary resistance may
remain, even after closure of the duct. This is thought to be related to a primary abnormality of the pulmonary
vasculature.[33]

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
