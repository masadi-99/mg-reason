Atrial flutter Overview
Summary
Atrial flutter, in the typical form, is characterized electrocardiographically by flutter waves, which are a saw-
tooth pattern of atrial activation, most prominent in leads II, III, aVF, and V1.
Atrial rates are typically above 250 bpm and up to 320 bpm.
Ventricular rates range from 120 to 160 bpm, and most characteristically 150 bpm, because an associated
2:1 atrioventricular block is common.
This rhythm is commonly associated with atrial fibrillation, into which it may degenerate. Atrial fibrillation may
also convert to atrial flutter.
If the rhythm persists despite treatment of the underlying cause or in the absence of a reversible cause,
electrical cardioversion is used to terminate the arrhythmia.
If electrical cardioversion is unavailable or not acceptable to the patient, pharmacologic cardioversion may be
attempted.
Because of alterations in atrial activation, the ECG often fluctuates between both rhythms in the same
patient.
Definition
Typical atrial flutter (counterclockwise cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter) is a macroreentrant atrial
tachycardia with atrial rates usually above 250 bpm up to 320 bpm. It results from organized electrical activity
in which large areas of the atrium take part in the reentrant circuit. The typical form depends on the so-
called cavotricuspid isthmus for part of the circuit: tricuspid annulus as the anterior boundary and the crista
terminalis/eustachian ridge as the posterior boundary, as well as the endocardial cavity of the right atrium.
The term counterclockwise refers to the direction of activation when the tricuspid annulus is viewed en
face, whereby activation occurs up the septum, down the right atrial free wall in a counterclockwise fashion.
Characteristic features on ECG are negatively directed saw-tooth atrial deflections (f waves) seen in leads II,
III, and aVF, with positively directed deflections in lead V1.[1] This rhythm is closely related to atrial fibrillation.

Atrial flutter Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The overall incidence has been reported as 88/100,000 person-years, with increasing rates with older age.
The incidence is 5/100,000 in people <50 years of age and 587/100,000 in those >80 years of age.[5] It
occurs 2.5 times more frequently in men than in women, and increases exponentially with age.[6] Atrial
fibrillation often coexists with atrial flutter, occurring in 24% to 62% of individuals before flutter ablation and
in 30% to 70% after flutter ablation.[6] Most cases of atrial flutter (>98%) are associated with an identifiable
predisposing event or a preexisting comorbidity.[5]
Etiology
Atrial flutter generally results from structural or functional conduction abnormalities of the atria. Structural
abnormalities include atrial dilation due to a number of processes (see Risk Factors); incisional scars from
prior atrial surgery, particularly for congenital heart disease; prior atrial ablation sites; and idiopathic fibrosis
within the atrium. In addition, it can be precipitated by toxic and metabolic conditions such as thyrotoxicosis,
alcoholism, or pericarditis. Patients taking antiarrhythmics for chronic suppression of atrial fibrillation
may convert to atrial flutter, noted most commonly with Vaughan Williams class Ic drugs (flecainide and
propafenone) and with class Ia (disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine) and amiodarone.[7] [8]
Other medications that can cause or exacerbate atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation include sympathomimetics,
stimulants, immune modulators, and antineoplastic agents.[9]
Occasionally, atrial flutter can be congenital.[10]
Pathophysiology
The typical form of atrial flutter is a prototypic macroreentrant arrhythmia, in which the reentrant wavefront
travels up the interatrial septum and down the right atrial free wall ("typical" form) or vice versa ("reverse
typical" form). The lateral anatomic boundaries are critical to the development and maintenance of the
circuit. One of these boundaries is the tricuspid valve annulus and is fixed or anatomic. The other is
generally a functional line of block between the venae cavae.[11] Atypical flutters are seen when the
cavotricuspid isthmus is not part of the circuit, and are characterized by a continuously undulating pattern
by ECG that does not fit strict criteria for the typical and reverse typical forms of atrial flutter. This is a
limitation in the mechanistic/anatomic classification scheme, as the exact mechanism can be determined
only by electrophysiologic mapping studies and not from the ECG alone. Clinical presentations and
electrophysiologic features of atypical atrial flutter and other types of atrial tachycardias can overlap.[2]

Classification
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart
Rhythm Society classification of atrial flutter/atrial tachycardias[4]
Atrial flutter is a macroreentrant atrial tachycardia with constant P wave/flutter morphology with a rate usually
>250 bpm. It is distinguishable from focal atrial tachycardia, which has discrete P waves with an intervening
isoelectric segment. Focal atrial tachycardia is caused mechanistically by micro-reentry or increased
automaticity and generally has atrial rates in the range of 100-250 bpm.
Cavotricuspid isthmus dependent (typical atrial flutter):
• Counterclockwise atrial flutter with ECG flutter waves characterized by:
• Negative deflection in leads II, III, aVF
• Positive deflection in lead V1.
• Clockwise atrial flutter (reverse typical atrial flutter) with ECG flutter waves characterized by:
• Positive deflection in leads II, III, aVF
• Negative deflection in lead V1.
Non cavotricuspid isthmus dependent (atypical atrial flutter):

THEORY
• Re-entry that does not depend upon conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus
• Circuit is typically defined by atrial scars due to prior heart surgery, ablations, or idiopathic causes
• Location determines ablation approach and risks
• Multiple sites of re-entry may be present
• Can occur in both the left and right atria.
Case history
Case history #1
A 77-year-old man presents with palpitations and new shortness of breath, especially with exertion. He
has a history of rheumatic fever in childhood. He has been told he has a murmur but does not recall
having had an echocardiogram. He is otherwise healthy.
Case history #2
A 76-year-old man presents with progressive symptoms of dyspnea and increasing peripheral edema.
He denies palpitations. He has a history of congestive heart failure from hypertensive heart disease.

Atrial flutter Diagnosis
Approach
Patients with recent-onset atrial flutter generally present with palpitations, fatigue, light-headedness, chest
pain, and/or dyspnea. In addition, exercise intolerance, worsening heart failure symptoms, and pulmonary
complaints can also occur. Less commonly, hypotension, syncope, or embolic events can be the presenting
symptoms.[4] The history should be directed at identifying the onset, frequency, and duration, and the
presence of structural heart disease or precipitating cause.
History
In approximately 60% of patients, atrial flutter occurs as part of an acute disease process, and resolves
with that process.[5] Identifying that underlying cause or trigger is therefore central to management. The
history should establish whether there are any concurrent symptoms of an acute disease process, such
as fever and cough in the case of pneumonia. A thorough past medical history should identify whether
there is a history of any risk factors:
• Hypertensive heart disease
• Heart failure
• Asthma
• COPD
• Hyperthyroidism
• Mitral or tricuspid valve disease
• Atrial fibrillation
• Structural heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease
• Recent cardiac or thoracic procedures, including ablation
• Prior myocardial infarction (MI) or pulmonary embolism or other pathology that can cause atrial
dilation
• Diabetes.
A drug history will reveal whether the patient is taking antiarrhythmics for chronic suppression of atrial
fibrillation such as class Ic drugs (flecainide and propafenone) or class Ia (disopyramide, procainamide,
quinidine) and amiodarone.[7] [8] [20] Digitalis drugs (e.g., digoxin) are also known to be a risk factor for
atrial flutter.
Physical examination
The pulse in a patient with atrial flutter may be regular or irregularly irregular. On examining the jugular
venous pressure, jugular venous pulsations with rapid flutter waves may be seen. Manifestations
of the underlying cause should be sought through a thorough physical exam. Wheezing, rales, and
hyperinflation suggest lung disease. Murmurs or rubs on auscultation suggest valvular disease,
pericarditis, or congenital heart disease. Signs of hyperthyroidism may be present, such as tachycardia,
fine tremor, goitre with or without nodules, palmar erythema, and hair thinning. Blood pressure should
be taken and scars from recent cardiac or thoracic surgery looked for. These may suggest underlying
conditions that may complicate therapy.
Investigations
The ECG pattern may fluctuate between atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. The ECG is diagnostic:
• In the typical form (counterclockwise atrial flutter): negatively directed saw-tooth atrial deflections (f
waves) in leads II, III, and aVF, and positive deflections in V1 with atrial rates of 240 to 320 bpm.

DIAGNOSIS
• Typically there is 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block and the characteristic ventricular rate is 150 bpm.
• Variable block may occur leading to an irregular rate.
• In the reverse typical form (clockwise isthmus-dependent flutter): positive flutter waves in leads II, III,
and aVF, and negative flutter waves in lead V1.
• Atypical flutter has an ECG pattern of continuous undulation of the atrial complex, not meeting criteria
for typical or reverse typical flutter, with atrial rates >240 bpm.[3] [4]

Electrolyte abnormalities are generally not the sole cause of atrial flutter, but imbalances should be checked
and corrected. Thyroid function tests should be checked to rule out thyroid disease as an underlying cause.
Cardiac enzymes should be checked if acute MI is suspected, and digitalis levels taken if a patient is taking
digitalis drugs (e.g., digoxin).
A chest x-ray should be performed and pulmonary function tests should be considered, as atrial flutter is
often associated with a known history of, or suggestive presentation for, lung disease. Spiral computed
tomography with pulmonary embolism protocol may be considered if pulmonary embolism is suspected.
The transthoracic echocardiogram should be used to detect structural heart disease. Specifically, atrial
sizes can be measured and valvular disease, ventricular function, and pericardial disease assessed. Right
ventricular systolic pressures can also be measured and indicate the presence or absence of pulmonary
hypertension, which can be seen in pulmonary processes.
Electrophysiologic studies are usually performed on patients with recurrent atrial flutter, particularly if
antiarrhythmic drug therapy has been ineffective or not tolerated because of adverse effects, if the ventricular

rate is difficult to control with drugs, or if atrial flutter persists despite resolution of acute underlying illness.
Electrophysiology studies require the input of electrophysiologists and may assist in diagnosis, mapping for
the critical isthmus (i.e., the cavotricuspid isthmus), and therapeutic ablation.
An atrial electrogram recording can help visualize flutter waves when diagnosis is not clear. They are
recorded by postsurgical epicardial leads, dual chamber pacemaker, or esophageal lead.
Do not use imaging stress tests or coronary CT angiography routinely in the diagnosis of atrial flutter if there
are no symptoms or signs of cardiovascular disease.[21]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
worsening heart failure or pulmonary symptoms (common)
• These are common underlying conditions, and worsening of symptoms may indicate other
decompensation or new-onset atrial flutter.
jugular venous pulsations with rapid flutter waves (common)
• Rapid flutter waves can be noted in the jugular venous wave form.
Other diagnostic factors
palpitations (common)
• Classic symptom, but because atrioventricular block usually results in normal ventricular rate, patients
may not have this symptom.
fatigue or lightheadedness (common)
• Nonspecific but can be the main presenting symptom.
chest pain (uncommon)
• Can be symptom of atrial flutter, underlying myocardial ischemia, or a pulmonary embolic event.
dyspnea (uncommon)
• Can be a symptom of atrial flutter, underlying myocardial ischemia or a pulmonary embolic event.
syncope (uncommon)
• Rare presentation of atrial flutter.
hypotension (uncommon)
• Rare presentation of atrial flutter. Atrioventricular block typically results in normal ventricular rate and
preservation of blood pressure.
embolic events (uncommon)
• Such as stroke. Rare presentation of atrial flutter.

Risk factors
Strong
increasing age
• The incidence is 5/100,000 in people <50 years of age and 587/100,000 in those >80 years of age. It
is especially uncommon in children or young adults unless associated with structural heart disease.[5]
[12]
valvular dysfunction
• Mitral or tricuspid valve stenosis or regurgitation can lead to atrial dilation. Dilation promotes the
development and maintenance of reentrant circuits.
atrial septal defects
• Can lead to atrial dilation. Dilation promotes the development and maintenance of reentrant circuits.
atrial dilation
• Some pathologic conditions can lead to atrial dilation; or, rarely, this occurs in the absence of structural
heart disease. Dilation promotes the development and maintenance of reentrant circuits.
recent cardiac or thoracic procedures
• Although atrial fibrillation is the most common postcardiac surgery arrhythmia, atrial flutter can occur
and is due to pericarditis, alterations in autonomic tone, or atrial ischemia.[4] [13]
• Transient atrial flutter in the first 2 months after pulmonary vein isolation procedures is common and
may not necessitate long-term treatment. Can occur in up to 55% of such patients.[14]
surgical or postablation scarring of atria
• Any surgical incision involving the atria can result in atrial flutter with the flutter circuit involving atypical
isthmuses between anatomic barriers, prior atrial incision sites, and scarred regions, as well as the
cavotricuspid isthmus.[4] [12] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]
• Scarring from prior atrial ablation lesions can lead to development of a reentrant circuit.[14]
• Approximately 10% to 30% incidence at 5- to 10-year follow-up after congenital heart disease
operative corrections.[19] May also be associated with procedures such as valve surgery, in which
atrial incisions or maze procedures were performed.
heart failure
• The risk of developing atrial flutter is increased 3.5 times in the presence of heart failure. In 16%
of patients with atrial flutter, the arrhythmia was attributable to heart failure in a population-based
epidemiologic study.[5]
hyperthyroidism
• May precipitate atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.
COPD
• In 12% of patients with atrial flutter, the arrhythmia was attributable to COPD in a population-based
epidemiologic study.[5] May precipitate atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

positive deflections in V1 with atrial rates of 240 to 320 bpm are seen.
• 2:1 atrioventricular block is usually present in the typical form,
resulting in the characteristic ventricular rate of 150 bpm. However,
variable block may occur, leading to an irregular rate.
• In the reverse typical form (clockwise isthmus-dependent flutter),
positive flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF, and negative flutter

with atrial rates >240 bpm.
• Carotid massage or giving adenosine during ECG recording generally
slows the ventricular rate to allow better visualization of the flutter

Atrial flutter Diagnosis
Differentials
Condition Differentiating signs /
symptoms
Differentiating tests
Atrial fibrillation • No differentiating signs/
symptoms
• ECG shows uncoordinated
atrial activation with rapidly
oscillating, fibrillatory waves
that vary in amplitude,
shape, and timing.[20]
Atrial tachycardia • No differentiating signs/
symptoms
• Generally, by ECG, atrial
tachycardia has isoelectric
intervals between the P
waves in all leads. At very
high atrial rates, it may
be extremely difficult to
distinguish the two.[20]
Criteria
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart
Rhythm Society classification of atrial flutter/atrial tachycardias[4]
Atrial flutter is a macroreentrant atrial tachycardia with constant P wave/flutter morphology with a rate usually
>250 bpm. It is distinguishable from focal atrial tachycardia, which has discrete P waves with an intervening
isoelectric segment. Focal atrial tachycardia is caused mechanistically by micro-reentry or increased
automaticity and generally has atrial rates in the range of 100-250 bpm.
Cavotricuspid isthmus dependent (typical atrial flutter):
• Counterclockwise atrial flutter with ECG flutter waves characterized by:
• Negative deflection in leads II, III, aVF
• Positive deflection in lead V1.
• Clockwise atrial flutter (reverse typical atrial flutter) with ECG flutter waves characterized by:
• Positive deflection in leads II, III, aVF
• Negative deflection in lead V1.
Non cavotricuspid isthmus dependent (atypical atrial flutter):
• Re-entry that does not depend upon conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus
• Circuit is typically defined by atrial scars due to prior heart surgery, ablations, or idiopathic causes
• Location determines ablation approach and risks
• Multiple sites of re-entry may be present
• Can occur in both the left and right atria.

Atrial flutter Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Hemodynamically unstable patients require urgent synchronized cardioversion. Hemodynamically
stable patients can be treated with pharmacologic therapy; however, cardioversion (either electrical or
pharmacologic) is an option in patients who do not respond to rate-control drugs. Patients with recurrent
atrial flutter, or those who do not respond to elective cardioversion, may require catheter ablation of the
cavotricuspid isthmus. Anticoagulation and treatment of any coexisting disease processes are important
adjunctive therapies in all patients.
Hemodynamically unstable
If atrial flutter is associated with acute hemodynamic collapse involving symptomatic hypotension,
congestive heart failure evidenced by pulmonary edema and/or elevated serum brain natriuretic
peptide, or myocardial ischemia (acute ischemic ECG changes, angina), emergent direct current (DC)-
synchronized cardioversion is indicated.[6] [23] This rhythm is generally successfully cardioverted with
monophasic shocks using <50 J of energy, although the higher-energy initial shocks are indicated for
emergent therapy and may be needed for elective cardioversions.[4] In patients with hemodynamic
instability, initiation of anticoagulation should not delay DC cardioversion.[20]
Hemodynamically stable: rate control
Most commonly, patients in atrial flutter present with 2:1 or higher grades of atrioventricular (AV)
conduction block and are thus stable hemodynamically. In approximately 60% of patients, atrial flutter
occurs as part of an acute disease process.[5] When the underlying process resolves, sinus rhythm is
generally restored and chronic therapy is not needed.
AV-nodal blocking agents (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and amiodarone) are
considered a first-line therapy for rate control in the immediate acute setting.[6] [8] Beta-blockers are
indicated for rate control in patients with atrial flutter complicating acute coronary syndromes to reduce
myocardial oxygen demands.[6] Beta-blockers should be used with caution in patients with COPD or
asthma, because they might provoke bronchospasm; calcium-channel blockers are preferred if chronic
lung disease is also present. Calcium-channel blockers are generally contraindicated or used with
extreme caution in patients with heart failure.[8] Intravenous amiodarone is useful for acute control of the
ventricular rate (in the absence of pre-excitation) in patients with atrial flutter and systolic heart failure
when beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective.[8]
Adequate rate control is more difficult with atrial flutter than with atrial fibrillation. However, most
randomized controlled trials of AV nodal-blocking agents generally do not report data for atrial flutter
alone, but rather combined groups of patients with atrial fibrillation and/or flutter.[4] In addition, slowing of
the atrial rate can cause rapid one-to-one AV conduction, particularly with class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs in
the absence of AV nodal-blocking agents.[4] [7] [8] For example, atrial flutter with a rate of 300 bpm that
conducts 2:1 will result in a ventricular rate of 150 bpm. An antiarrhythmic drug that slows the flutter rate
to 200 bpm might allow 1:1 AV nodal conduction in the absence of AV nodal blockers, thus resulting in a
potentially clinically dangerous ventricular rate of 200 bpm.
Hemodynamically stable: cardioversion or pacing
If the rhythm persists despite pharmacologic therapy and treatment of the underlying cause (or in the
absence of a reversible cause), elective synchronized cardioversion is generally preferred, both because

Atrial flutter Management
atrial flutter is extremely responsive to electrical cardioversion and because it is relatively difficult to rate
control chronically.[4][8] [20] The success rate for external DC cardioversion, using 5 to 50 J of energy,
is 95% to 100%.[34] [35] [36] Lower amounts are most successful with biphasic rather than monophasic
waveforms. However, higher energies may be needed.[23] [34] [35] [36] 
Rate-control agents are continued before cardioversion and discontinued when sinus rhythm is restored.
However, they can be continued afterward to prevent rapid ventricular rate in case of recurrence. Dosage
may need to be decreased after cardioversion if there is bradycardia or hypotension.
Rapid atrial pacing is useful for acute conversion of atrial flutter in patients who have pacing wires in
place as part of a permanent pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or for temporary atrial
pacing after cardiac surgery.[4]
The decision to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram prior to cardioversion (both electrical and
chemical) to assess for left atrial or appendage thrombus should follow the recommendations for atrial
fibrillation.[20]
Hemodynamically stable: pharmacologic cardioversion
If atrial flutter persists despite resolution of acute provocation, and electrical cardioversion is unavailable
or not acceptable to the patient, pharmacologic cardioversion may be attempted if the patient has a
normal QT interval and no structural heart disease. It is also an option when sedation is not tolerated or
available.
Intravenous ibutilide is the preferred agent for pharmacologic cardioversion; however, oral dofetilide may
also be used.[4] Dofetilide is contraindicated in patients with long QT syndrome, QT prolongation, renal
failure, and torsade de pointes. It requires specialist inpatient monitoring and should only be initiated by a
physician experienced with its use.
Pharmacologic cardioversion is less effective than synchronized cardioversion, with potential for being
proarrhythmic. The success rate is 38% to 76% for conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm, with the
mean time to conversion reported to be 30 minutes in those who respond. Ventricular proarrhythmia,
specifically sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, occurs at a rate of 1.2% to 1.7%.[37] [38] [39]
[40] For this reason, these drugs should not be given to those with severe structural heart disease and
prolonged QT interval.
The major risk associated with pharmacologic cardioversion is torsade de pointes. Patients with reduced
left ventricular ejection fraction are at the highest risk. Pretreatment with magnesium may reduce the risk
of torsade de pointes. Continuous ECG monitoring is required during administration of these agents and
for at least 4 hours after completion of therapy (ibutilide), or at least 3 days (or 12 hours after conversion
to normal sinus rhythm, whichever is greater) after completion of therapy (dofetilide).
Intravenous class Ic agents and oral sotalol have relatively poor efficacy in acute conversion, are
associated with significant adverse effects, and are not recommended.[4]
The decision to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram prior to cardioversion (both electrical and
chemical) to assess for left atrial or appendage thrombus should follow the recommendations for atrial
fibrillation.[20]

Atrial flutter Management
MANAGEMENT
Recurrent or refractory atrial flutter: catheter ablation
Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is
symptomatic or refractory to pharmacologic rate control, patients in whom at least one antiarrhythmic drug
has failed, patients who develop atrial flutter as a result of antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation, and
patients with recurrent atrial flutter.
Catheter ablation has a class I indication in the following clinical scenarios:[4] [6] [41]
• Symptomatic or refractory to pharmacologic rate control
• Recurrent symptomatic CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least one antiarrhythmic agent
• Symptomatic recurrent episodes of non-CTI-dependent flutter at experienced catheter ablation
centers
• Persistent atrial flutter or atrial flutter associated with tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy with
depressed left ventricular function.
Reasonable (class II) indications include:
• CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone
used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation
• Patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation who also have a history of documented
clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter
• Primary therapy of recurrent symptomatic non-CTI-dependent flutter before therapeutic trials of
antiarrhythmic drugs after carefully weighing the potential risks and benefits of treatment options
• Asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter
• First episode of symptomatic typical atrial flutter.
Catheter ablation is effective at maintaining sinus rhythm in typical atrial flutter in which the CTI is a
necessary part of the arrhythmic circuit. This invasive technique involves a femoral venous approach. An
ablation catheter is placed at the isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus using
either fluoroscopic guidance or a 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system. Radiofrequency energy
is then applied to create a line of ablation from the tricuspid annulus to the inferior vena cava.
The success rate for treatment of typical atrial flutter is high and has been reported at 92% for the first
procedure and 97% for multiple procedures.[8] [41] [42] [43] Atypical flutter is more difficult to ablate,
particularly when associated with congenital heart disease. In such situations, referral to an experienced
center ought to be considered.
Recurrent or refractory atrial flutter: long-term antiarrhythmic
therapy
Chronic pharmacologic therapy is generally not required. In approximately 60% of cases, atrial flutter
arises in the setting of a precipitating cause and, once that acute process resolves, sinus rhythm is
restored.[5]
Most studies evaluating long-term antiarrhythmic therapy have grouped atrial flutter patients with atrial
fibrillation patients. Therefore, exact efficacy rates are difficult to determine, but are probably around 50%
for class I antiarrhythmics.[4]
Antiarrhythmic drug choice depends on the presence or absence of underlying heart disease and any
comorbidities. Options include amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone.

Atrial flutter Management
AV nodal agents such as beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers should be used in conjunction with
class Ic drugs (e.g., flecainide, propafenone) because of the concern for slowing of the atrial flutter rate
with resultant 1:1 AV conduction at high rates. However, class Ic drugs are contraindicated in patients with
structural heart disease.
Class III agents such as oral dofetilide, sotalol, and amiodarone resulted in maintenance of sinus rhythm
in 73% of atrial flutter patients.[4] Amiodarone is generally less effective than dofetilide; however, it is less
proarrhythmic than other antiarrhythmics and is relatively safe in patients with structural heart disease.[44]
Dofetilide is contraindicated in patients with long QT syndrome, QT prolongation, renal failure, and
torsade de pointes. Continuous ECG monitoring is required during administration and for at least 3 days
(or 12 hours after conversion to normal sinus rhythm, whichever is greater) after completion of therapy. It
should only be initiated by a physician experienced in its use. Sotalol has both class II beta-blocking and
class III properties, and thus provides rate control.
Anticoagulant therapy
The guidelines for thromboembolic prophylaxis in atrial flutter are the same as those for atrial fibrillation.
[8][20] [22][45][46]
Selection of stroke risk reduction therapy should be guided by the patient’s risk of stroke, risks of bleeding
with therapy, and their individual preferences.[20] The American Heart Association (AHA) and European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines emphasize a risk factor-based approach using a validated
clinical risk score such as the CHA2DS2-VASc score system.[8] [20] The CHA2DS2-VASc score is
considered the most validated score; however, newer online calculators for risk scores, such as ATRIA
(Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) and GARFIELD (Global Anticoagulant Registry
in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation), in comparison to CHA2DS2-VASc, may modestly improve discrimination
between high versus low risk and may offer potential advantages in specific populations.[20] The HAS-
BLED score can be used to assess bleeding risk.[20] 
Observational studies have demonstrated a 1.7% to 7% risk of embolization during cardioversion from
atrial flutter.[47] Anticoagulation management prior to ablation should be handled similarly to that before
cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation after catheter ablation for atrial flutter should follow the
same approach for that after atrial fibrillation ablation. The incidence of thrombus or echo-dense material
in the atria in patients with atrial flutter who are not anticoagulated ranges from 0% to 34% and increases
with atrial flutter duration more than 48 hours.[48] Atrial mechanical stunning has also been documented
to persist for several weeks after cardioversion.[49]
The key options for anticoagulation are a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, or a direct oral
anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor), rivaroxaban, apixaban, or
edoxaban (direct factor Xa inhibitors). Both vitamin K antagonists and DOACs are approved as
efficacious agents for stroke prevention in this patient population.[20] In patients who are candidates
for anticoagulation and do not have either moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical
heart valves, DOACs are recommended over warfarin to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, systemic
embolism and intracranial hemorrhage.[20] While it is reasonable to use DOACs as first-line agents or as
a subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients with atrial flutter, warfarin remains the first-line therapy
in patients with AF and moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves.[20]
DOACs are recommended over warfarin in eligible patients (i.e., patients who do not have moderate-
to-severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve).[20] Bridging with a parenteral anticoagulant
is not necessary when initiating DOACs for this indication. DOACs do not require monitoring of

anticoagulant activity; however, they must be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and
a dose adjustment may be necessary. In the event of major bleeding, the effects of dabigatran can be
reversed with idarucizumab, for reversal of apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban andexanet alfa can be
used (recombinant coagulation factor Xa).[20]
Edoxaban should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance >95 mL/minute because of an
increased risk of ischemic stroke.[20] Initial anticoagulation with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight
heparin (LMWH) or intravenous unfractionated heparin may be necessary for patients presenting
acutely with atrial flutter, pending full evaluation and selection of ongoing antithrombotic therapy;
recommendations vary according to duration of symptoms and timing of cardioversion.
Warfarin is an alternative to DOAC therapy indicated for selected patients (e.g., patients with mechanical
heart valves, clinically significant rheumatic mitral stenosis. Intravenous unfractionated heparin or
subcutaneous LMWH should be continued until an INR of 2-3 is achieved with warfarin therapy (bridging
therapy).[20]
If there are no risk factors for stroke, aspirin either alone or in combination with clopidogrel is not
recommended to reduce the risk of stroke or to prevent thromboembolic events.[20]
Anticoagulation should be established before cardioversion and is continued for at least 4 weeks after
cardioversion, and may be required for longer in some patients.[20]

(direct factor Xa inhibitors). Both vitamin K
antagonists and DOACs are approved as
efficacious agents for stroke prevention in
this patient population.[20] In patients who
are candidates for anticoagulation and do not
have either moderate-severe rheumatic mitral
stenosis or mechanical heart valves, DOACs
are recommended over warfarin to reduce the
risk of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism
and intracranial hemorrhage.[20] While it is
reasonable to use DOACs as first-line agents
or as a subsequent replacement for warfarin
in patients with atrial flutter, warfarin remains
the first-line therapy in patients with AF and

anticoagulant is not necessary when initiating
DOACs for this indication. DOACs do not
require monitoring of anticoagulant activity;
however, they must be used with caution in
patients with renal impairment and a dose

major bleeding, the effects of dabigatran can
be reversed with idarucizumab; for reversal of

1st catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid
isthmus (CTI)
» Useful in patients with atrial flutter that is
symptomatic or refractory to pharmacologic
rate control, patients in whom at least one
antiarrhythmic drug has failed, patients who
develop atrial flutter as a result of antiarrhythmic
therapy for atrial fibrillation, and patients with
recurrent atrial flutter.
» Catheter ablation is effective at maintaining
sinus rhythm in typical atrial flutter in which
the CTI is a necessary part of the arrhythmic
circuit. This invasive technique involves
a femoral venous approach. An ablation
catheter is placed at the isthmus between the
inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus
using either fluoroscopic guidance or a 3-
dimensional electroanatomic mapping system.
Radiofrequency energy is then applied to create
a line of ablation from the tricuspid annulus to
the inferior vena cava.
» The success rate for treatment of typical atrial
flutter is high and has been reported at 92%
for the first procedure and 97% for multiple
procedures.[8] [41] [42] [43]
» Atypical flutter is more difficult to ablate,
particularly when associated with congenital
heart disease. In such situations, consider
referral to an experienced center.

guidelines, as not many of the studies looked at
atrial flutter separately.[4]
Secondary prevention
Anticoagulation is recommended for persistent or paroxysmal atrial flutter, as it is for atrial fibrillation, for the
prevention of thromboembolic events including acute stroke.
Patient discussions
Recurrent palpitations should be reported to the cardiologist. Associated symptoms of chest pain,
shortness of breath, and hypotension warrant a call to activate emergency medical services.

Atrial flutter Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients presenting with acute atrial flutter who have paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial flutter
need long-term follow-up.
• Depending on the nature of the underlying cause (i.e., coronary artery disease, valvular heart
disease, or heart failure), patients should have regular follow-up at a minimum of every 3 to 6
months.
• Patients who are taking antiarrhythmic agents need follow-up ECG monitoring. Exercise stress
testing is recommended to assess for drug-related ventricular tachycardia due to proarrhythmic
effects of flecainide and propafenone.
• A regular follow-up to check and monitor the international normalized ratio is mandatory for patients
who are taking warfarin for anticoagulation.
For patients with persistent atrial flutter that is felt to be secondary to a reversible cause, long-term follow-
up may not be necessary after the initial treatment and evaluation of the atrial flutter, if the cause has
been removed. For patients requiring continued therapy due to high risk of recurrence, follow-up should
generally include the following general categories:
• Adequate treatment of the associated medical/cardiac diagnosis
• Periodic assessments of efficacy of therapy
• Periodic evaluation for the adverse effects or complications of the therapy
• Maintenance and monitoring of adequate anticoagulation
• Reevaluation of the current therapy if the underlying cardiovascular problem changes or progresses
or the atrial flutter becomes permanent.
In the few patients with atrial flutter who have asymptomatic recurrences irrespective of the therapy
(antiarrhythmic drug or ablation), chronic anticoagulation should be considered long term. If the patient
is symptomatic, evaluation with Holter monitor, event monitor, or pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator interrogations can be considered, largely to assure that ventricular rates are controlled, and to
measure the number and duration of atrial flutter episodes. Clearly any change in the clinical status of a
patient with a history of atrial flutter should prompt the physician to look for a recurrence as the cause of
the clinical change.

Atrial flutter Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
beta-blocker-associated exacerbation of reactive airway
disease
short term medium
Beta-blockers may cause bronchospasm.They should be avoided in patients with known asthma or history
of lung disease with prominent history of wheezing.
myocardial ischemia short term low
Demand ischemia can result from poor rate control.
acute stroke short term low
Patients usually have paroxysmal to persistent atrial flutter with risk factors to thromboembolic events,
such as left atrial dilation, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and advanced
age.
Controversy exists as regards treatment of established embolic acute stroke in the presence of acute
atrial flutter. Anticoagulation in this setting may cause hemorrhagic stroke. Consultation with specialist
(neurologist) is highly recommended. Novel approaches to interrupt thrombus propagation by intravascular
devices are being studied.
medication-related bradycardia variable high
Secondary to atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers.
Can occur due to profound effects on the AV node while in atrial flutter or to the effects on the sinus node
when in sinus rhythm, particularly in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction.
Can occur with antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., flecainide or amiodarone) as well.
May require changing drug, or adding permanent pacing.
medication-related hypotension variable medium
Secondary to the vasodilatory effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, as well as the
atrioventricular (AV) nodal effects slowing the heart rate.
If this occurs, may resolve with lowering the dosage.
Other causes of hypotension should also be explored.
If the strategy was rate control only, consider AV nodal ablation for rate control; can also reconsider rhythm
control in some patients.
medication-related heart failure variable medium
Due to the negative inotropic effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, as well as some
antiarrhythmic drugs.

Atrial flutter Follow up
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
These drugs should be used cautiously in patients with poor left ventricular function and not at all in
patients with overt clinical heart failure until the heart failure is treated and compensated.
If heart rate control or rhythm control is the goal, amiodarone can be used to afford rate control or rhythm
control with little depression of contractility.
Optimization of heart failure regimen is also helpful.
medication-related proarrhythmia variable medium
May take many forms depending on the type and drug used. The most dangerous is ventricular
arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. Occurs with antiarrhythmic drugs that
prolong the QT or with drugs that prolong conduction in patients with underlying coronary disease.
medication-related thyroid dysfunction variable medium
Amiodarone contains iodine.
Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone and hypothyroidism more common than hyperthyroidism unless the
patient has a predilection to hyperthyroidism or a previous goiter.
Can replace thyroid hormone orally for hypothyroidism but usually need to discontinue the drug if
hyperthyroid and treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
complications of catheter ablation variable medium
Complications vary with the technique and experience, and some have decreased with modification of
ablation strategies. However, ablation for atrial flutter is generally quite safe.[41] [42]
May include pneumothorax (0.2%), atrioventricular (AV) fistulae, hematomas (<0.3%), congestive
heart failure exacerbation (<0.1%), cerebrovascular events (0% to 4%), pericardial effusion usually
uncomplicated (25%), pericardial tamponade (1%), organized atrial tachyarrhythmias (13%), AV block
(<1%), need for a pacemaker (<0.2%), and pulmonary embolus (<1%). Procedure-related death is
extremely rare (estimated at 0.03%).[41]
Most complications are handled acutely.
tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy variable low
From poor rate control and loss of active atrial contraction, a cardiomyopathy can result and support the
need for rhythm conversion.
medication-related pulmonary toxicity variable low
Acute toxicity presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome within hours of giving amiodarone.
The long-term toxicity causes inflammation and/or fibrosis.
Symptoms of an unexplained cough or dyspnea should trigger investigation with a chest x-ray and
pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with a diffusion capacity.
PFTs should be considered as routine follow-up every 6 to 12 months while using the drug.

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
Will require discontinuation of the drug in most cases.
Prognosis
In approximately 60% of cases, atrial flutter occurs in the setting of an acute process.[5] Once that process
has been treated, sinus rhythm is usually restored and chronic therapy is not required. The thromboembolic
risk is similar to that of atrial fibrillation, and guidelines for prophylaxis should follow the atrial fibrillation
guidelines. If all acute treatments and attempts at cardioversion and ablation fail, chronic atrial flutter is very
difficult to rate control and is not as responsive to antiarrhythmic agents as atrial fibrillation.

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
