Evaluation of tachycardia Overview
Summary
Tachycardia, generally defined as a heart rate ≥100 bpm, can be a normal physiologic response to a
systemic process or a manifestation of underlying pathology.[1] [2] The normal heart rate varies with age.
The normal sinus rate in infants is 110 to 150 bpm, which gradually slows with age.[3]
Classification of tachyarrhythmia
Several methods of classification of tachyarrhythmia are helpful in organizing and evaluating tachycardias.
These include: sinus versus non-sinus causes; atrial versus ventricular arrhythmias; narrow- versus wide-
complex tachycardias; regular versus irregular arrhythmias; and classification based on the site of origin of
the arrhythmia.[1]
Sinus versus non-sinus causes
Sinus tachycardia is a common cause of tachycardia that can often be mistaken for an arrhythmia. Diagnosis
depends on the P-wave morphology and the setting in which it occurs. Because each impulse originates in
the sinoatrial node, the ECG shows a P wave preceding each QRS interval with a normal P-wave axis. In
most cases, a secondary cause of sinus tachycardia can be identified. A careful assessment is important,
to evaluate whether the sinus rate is appropriate for the clinical situation. Sinus tachycardia can be mistaken
for other supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial flutter, particularly with rapid tachyarrhythmias (when
P waves are difficult to distinguish or when ectopic atrial foci originate near the sinoatrial node, such as near
the superior vena cava or upper crista terminalis).
Atrial versus ventricular arrhythmia
Whether the arrhythmia originates from the atrium or the ventricle is usually dependent on whether the QRS
complex is wide or narrow, and on the atrial:ventricular relationship. Atrial arrhythmias usually conduct to
the ventricle through the His-Purkinje system and result in a narrow QRS complex. Some overlap may occur
when conduction occurs with aberrancy (left or right bundle branch block), if there is pre-excitation, and
in the presence of antiarrhythmic agents that may slow conduction (sodium channel blockers). If P waves
are discernible, an atrial:ventricular relationship of <1 is highly suggestive of a ventricular origin, whereas a
relationship >1 is highly suggestive of an atrial origin. A 1:1 atrial:ventricular relationship can occur with both
atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
Narrow versus wide QRS complex
Classification can also be based on whether there is a narrow- (QRS interval <120 ms) or wide- (QRS
interval >120 ms) complex tachycardia. Narrow-QRS-complex tachycardia suggests that anterograde
conduction and thus depolarization of the ventricle occurs through the atrioventricular (AV) node and His-
Purkinje system. A wide-complex tachycardia suggests that conduction through the ventricle occurs through
the slower myocyte-to-myocyte connections (because of either AV conduction via an accessory pathway or
a ventricular origin) and can be seen even with sinus rhythm. However, atrial tachyarrhythmias that conduct
aberrantly may present as a wide-complex tachycardia.

Evaluation of tachycardia Overview
general, irregular narrow-complex arrhythmias include: atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter with variable conduction,
and multifocal atrial tachycardia. An irregular wide-complex tachycardia may be due to pre-excited atrial
fibrillation (due to a rapidly anterograde-conducting bypass tract), polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and
atrial fibrillation, or multifocal atrial tachycardia conducting with aberrancy.
Site of origin
Tachyarrhythmias can be classified according to the site of origin: atrial, junctional, or ventricular:
• Atrial impulses are characterized by initial depolarization of the atrium, from a single focus, such as
sinus tachycardia or atrial tachycardia; macro reentry around an anatomic obstacle, such as in typical
atrial flutter; or from multiple wavelets of reentry, such as atrial fibrillation.
• Arrhythmias that originate at the level of the junction of the atrium and ventricle (AV node and/or
proximal His bundle), such as AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or junctional ectopic tachycardia, are
characterized by depolarization of the ventricle and retrograde atrial activation (if present), manifested
by a retrograde P wave.
• Arrhythmias that originate from the ventricle may originate from the distal His-Purkinje system or
ventricular myocardium. The site of origin within the ventricle further defines some arrhythmias within
the ventricle. Examples include right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia and bundle branch
reentry ventricular tachycardia. Hemodynamic stability is not a helpful factor in differentiating atrial
and ventricular arrhythmias. Some cases of ventricular tachycardia may be initially well tolerated
hemodynamically. Misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment (i.e., calcium channel blockers) may have
catastrophic consequences.
When a patient with a wide-complex tachycardia is being evaluated and the diagnosis is not certain, the
arrhythmia must be initially regarded as ventricular tachycardia until it is proved to be otherwise.
Epidemiology
Sinus tachycardia is the most common cause of sustained tachycardia, as it is usually a normal physiologic
response to emotional or physical stimulation.[4]
Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, with an estimated global prevalence of
50 million in 2020.[5] [6][7] Up to 9% of patients aged 80 years or older have atrial fibrillation.[8] [9] As the
proportion of older people in the population increases, the number with atrial fibrillation is likely to increase
significantly.
In the US, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is estimated to increase from approximately 5.2 million in 2010
to 12.1 million in 2030.[10] [11] In the European Union, prevalence of atrial fibrillation (in adults ages >55
years) is projected to increase from 8.8 million in 2010 to 17.9 million by 2060.[12]
The incidence of atrial flutter has been reported as 88 cases per 100,000 person-years; it is more common in
men, with increasing age, and in those with heart failure or COPD.[13] [14]
PSVT, defined as intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (AV node reentry tachycardia, AV reciprocating
tachycardia, or atrial tachycardia) has an incidence of 57.8 cases per 100,000 person-years and a
prevalence of 1.26 million people in the US.[15] Females are twice as likely to develop PSVT, and the
incidence is five times greater in people older than 65 years compared with younger people.[16] Most cases
of supraventricular tachycardia are due to AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (60% of cases); the remainder are
due to AV reciprocating tachycardia (30%) and atrial tachycardia (10%).[17]

Evaluation of tachycardia Overview
OVERVIEW
The prevalence of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is not well known and the underlying mechanisms are
likely to be multifactorial, but patients are often young (age 15 to 50 years) and female.[1] [2] [18]
The prevalence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia is highly dependent on its type and duration. In patients with a
history of previous MI, the incidence of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia depends on the
size of the infarction and the overall left ventricular function.

Evaluation of tachycardia Theory
Etiology
The etiology of tachycardia is variable and often multifactorial. The most common type is sinus tachycardia.
Cases of tachyarrhythmias not due to a heightened sinus rate may be due to focal islets of tissue that fire
rapidly because of increased automaticity, triggered activity, or reentry within a tissue with heterogeneous
conduction properties. Secondary causes of tachyarrhythmia include ion channelopathies, myocardial
scar, surgical scar, increased atrial or ventricular wall tension and stretch due to elevated filling pressures,
ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, increased intrinsic catecholamines, myocarditis, or any combination of
these causes. Prescribed, legitimate, and illicit drug use have been implicated.
Narrow QRS (duration <120 ms) with a regular ventricular rhythm
Sinus tachycardia
A rhythm that originates in the sinoatrial (sinus) node with a rate above 100 bpm. This is usually a normal
response to physical, emotional, physiologic, or pharmacologic stress. Secondary causes of sinus
tachycardia include physical deconditioning, hypoxia, pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, hyperthyroidism,
anemia, drugs (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine), and prescribed medications (e.g.,
aminophylline, atropine, clozapine, catecholamines).[1] [2] [19]
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
A chronic, multisystem disorder that is thought to be due to an autoimmune process. POTS is characterized
by:[20] [21] [22] [23]
• frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (that improve rapidly when the patient returns to a supine
position) that interfere with daily living activities, and have continued for at least 3 months, and
• an increase in heart rate by ≥30 bpm (or ≥40 bpm in patients ages 12 to 19 years) within 10 minutes of
standing from a supine position or head-up tilt (without orthostatic hypotension) that is not due to other
causes of sinus tachycardia.
Inappropriate sinus tachycardia
A persistent increase in resting heart rate unrelated to or out of proportion to physical, emotional, pathologic,
or pharmacologic stress (resting heart rate >100 bpm or average heart rate >90 bpm in 24-hour ECG
monitoring). The precise etiology is unknown and is likely to be multifactorial. Increased sinus node
automaticity and autonomic dysfunction have been proposed as possible causes.[1] [2] [21]
Atrial tachycardia
Rapid atrial activation from a region of the atria other than the sinus node with rates typically between 100
and 250 bpm. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is defined as three or more sites of atrial activation (commonly
irregular rhythm). Focal atrial tachycardia can occur without cardiac disease. Atrial tachycardia with AV block
should raise the suspicion for digitalis toxicity. Hypokalemia can also exacerbate this condition.[24] Right-
sided atrial tachycardias tend to originate from the crista terminalis, tricuspid annulus, or coronary sinus
ostium. Left-sided atrial tachycardias often originate from around the pulmonary veins, atrial septum, or mitral
annulus.[1] [2]

Evaluation of tachycardia Theory
THEORY
Organized reentrant rhythm with atrial rates typically 250 to 350 bpm and ventricular rates often 145 to 150
bpm (due to 2:1 block) involving large areas of the atrium. In typical atrial flutter, the macroentry atrial circuit
rotates around the tricuspid valve and between the inferior vena cava and tricuspid annulus. This essential
part of the circuit can be a target for catheter ablation.[1] [2]

Sinus node reentry tachycardia
A tachycardia that originates from reentry circuits that involve the sinus node and perinodal tissue. It
is presumed to be secondary to heterogeneous conduction properties of the sinus node and perinodal
tissue.[1] [2]
AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)
A reentrant tachycardia involving two pathways within the AV node or perinodal atrial tissue. One pathway
has rapid conduction and a relatively long refractory period; the second pathway has slow conduction and
a shorter refractory period. Following a premature atrial impulse, the fast pathway is still refractory from

Evaluation of tachycardia Theory
the previous impulse but anterograde conduction can occur through the slow pathway, which is no longer
refractory. By the time slow-pathway conduction is complete, the fast pathway is no longer refractory and
retrograde conduction can occur. If the slow pathway is no longer refractory following retrograde conduction,
the cycle repeats. A less common form of AVNRT ("atypical" AVNRT) involves anterograde conduction down
the fast pathway, resulting in a reentry circuit that turns in the opposite direction to the more common "typical"
AVNRT described above.[1] [2]
AV reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT)
A reentrant tachycardia circuit that involves an accessory pathway as well as the native AV node. The
most common form (approximately 90% of cases) is orthodromic AVRT.[25] The arrhythmia results from
anterograde conduction through the AV node and retrograde conduction through the accessory pathway.
This results in a narrow-complex tachycardia because the ventricle is activated anterograde through the His-
Purkinje system.[26]
Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia
A form of orthodromic AVRT involving anterograde conduction through the AV node and retrograde
accessory-pathway conduction. The retrograde limb of this reentry circuit is characterized by slow
conduction, creating a very stable circuit (anterograde down the AV node and retrograde up the slowly
conducting bypass tract). The descriptive term "permanent" is added to reflect its stable nature and tendency
to recur frequently and dominate sinus rhythm. For this reason, this arrhythmia can sometimes cause a
tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. This rhythm has rates between 120 and 200 bpm.[1] [2] It is most
commonly seen in infants and children.[1] [2]
Junctional ectopic tachycardia
This rhythm is caused by abnormal rapid discharges from the junctional region (distal AV node or proximal
His-Purkinje system) and does not require atrial or ventricular involvement to originate. The congenital form
is insidious in presentation and is often identified in infants only after the development of tachycardia-induced
cardiomyopathy. It is sometimes seen after cardiac surgery and may result in hemodynamic instability
because of its rate and lack of AV synchrony. Clinical factors that may predispose to this arrhythmia include
digitalis toxicity, hypokalemia, myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, and inflammatory myocarditis.[1] [2]
Narrow QRS (duration <120 ms) with an irregular ventricular rhythm
Atrial fibrillation
A supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm due to the rapid and
random conduction of irregular impulses to the ventricle. The irregular impulses are due to multiple wavelets
of reentry that rotate randomly within the atria and randomly bombard the AV node.[27] Risk of atrial
fibrillation is increased in patients treated for hypertriglyceridemia with medication containing omega-3-acid
ethyl esters, particularly at high doses.[28] [29] [30]
Atrial tachycardia or flutter with variable AV conduction
In contrast to atrial fibrillation, rapid atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter result in fast but regular impulses to the
AV node. Conduction of impulses to the ventricle is variable but tends to be "regularly irregular" and with a
pattern.[1] [2]

Evaluation of tachycardia Theory
THEORY
This arrhythmia involves at least three distinct competing atrial foci. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is most
often associated with pulmonary disease but has also been associated with cardiac disease (valvular,
hypertensive, coronary) as well as a variety of other systemic conditions, including hypokalemia,
hypomagnesemia, and sepsis, and certain medications (including isoproterenol and aminophylline).[31] [32]
Wide QRS (duration >120 ms) with a regular ventricular rhythm
Atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and common supraventricular tachycardias that conduct with aberrancy to
the ventricle (left bundle branch block or right bundle branch block) are an important part of the differential
diagnosis of etiologies of wide-complex tachycardias with uniform QRS duration and morphology.
Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (monomorphic VT associated with a structurally normal heart)
Repetitive monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: a focal arrhythmia that is thought to be due to triggered
activity. Typically, it originates from the right ventricular outflow tract (when it is known as right ventricular
outflow tract tachycardia). The etiology is unknown. It is mostly seen in young and middle-aged patients of
both sexes with a structurally normal heart and is often provoked by exercise, emotion, stress, or hormone
fluctuations.[33] Less commonly the site of origin may be in the LV outflow tract, the LV epicardium, above
the pulmonary valve, or along the septal aspect of the mitral annulus. VT that maps to these regions behaves
similarly to “right ventricular outflow tract VT” and typically follows a benign clinical course.
Idiopathic left VT: occurs due to reentry around the specialized conduction tissue and slow calcium-ion-
sensitive myocardial tissue. The etiology of this arrhythmia is unknown. It is sensitive to calcium channel
blockers, which may terminate and control the arrhythmia. The reentry circuit usually involves the left
posterior fascicle and the VT is therefore relatively narrow, with a right bundle branch block and a superior
axis on the 12-lead ECG. It is seen in patients aged 15 to 40 years with structurally normal hearts. Seventy
percent of cases are in males. In most cases, this VT is not associated with an increased risk of sudden
death.[34] [35]
Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
An automatic focus originating in the ventricular myocardium. Similar to VT, though rates are no more than
20% faster than the sinus rate (typically 80-120 bpm).[34]
Monomorphic VT associated with prior myocardial infarction
An arrhythmia that usually originates at the interface between healthy and damaged myocardium and is most
commonly a reentrant rhythm.[36] It is more commonly seen with larger infarctions and in patients with a
depressed ejection fraction.
Monomorphic VT associated with nonischemic cardiomyopathy
Regardless of the etiology of the cardiomyopathy, heterogeneous conduction properties within the ventricular
myocardium due to cardiomyopathy can serve as a substrate for reentry and result clinically in VT. Some
specific cardiomyopathies merit special attention.[34]
• Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia: characterized by fatty right ventricular infiltration and
fibrosis or thinning. VT is due to reentry within this complicated substrate.
• Bundle branch reentry VT: a common cause of sustained VT in patients with nonischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy. The reentry circuit usually conducts anterograde down the right bundle branch,

Evaluation of tachycardia Theory
across the ventricular septum, and conducts retrograde up the left bundle branch. The characteristic
12-lead ECG shows a left bundle branch block pattern during VT because of this pattern of activation.
• Cardiac sarcoidosis: may present with arrhythmias (such as advanced AV block or VT) and/or
unexplained new onset heart failure without a history of systemic sarcoidosis.[37][38] [39] The patchy
formation of granulomas, fibrosis, and scarring leads to VT due to reentry within this complicated
substrate.[37] Clinically overt cardiac sarcoidosis has been reported in 5% to 10% of cases with
systemic sarcoidosis.[37] [40] [41] Cardiac sarcoidosis has been confirmed in approximately one third
of middle-aged patients (37%) presenting with unexplained high-grade atrioventricular block.[42]
• Chagas cardiomyopathy: VT is predominantly seen in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, which is
probably caused by an autoimmune response to infection with  Trypanosoma cruzi . The mechanism is
likely to be related to the resulting fibrosis of the myocardium. The mechanism of VT is reentry within
this complicated substrate.
Rapid atrial arrhythmias associated with a "bystander" accessory pathway
Any atrial arrhythmia (atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia ) that normally conducts through the native
His-Purkinje system and would manifest with a narrow QRS can instead present as a wide-complex
tachycardia if there is also an associated accessory pathway.[1] [2] Additionally, with rapid supraventricular
rhythms, a rate-related bundle branch may develop only at times of tachycardia, resulting in a wide-complex-
tachycardia morphology.
Antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia
Reentrant circuit in which an anterograde circuit conducts down the accessory pathway and retrograde back
up the AV node, resulting in a wide-QRS-complex morphology. The reentry circuit in this arrhythmia is the
same as that in orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia but in the opposite direction. Because activation is
anterograde down the accessory pathway, the QRS complex is maximally preexcited during tachycardia.[1]
[2]
Paced rhythm
Patients with pacemakers can present with wide-complex tachycardia secondary to rapid ventricular pacing.
Most commonly this is due to a dual chamber device tracking an atrial arrhythmia (atrial tachycardia and
atrial flutter) with subsequent rapid ventricular pacing.

Wide QRS (duration >120 ms) with an irregular ventricular rhythm
Causes include the following:
• Atrial fibrillation with a bundle branch block
• Multifocal atrial tachycardia with a bundle branch block
• Atrial tachycardia or flutter with variable AV conduction with a bundle branch block or accessory
pathway.
Variable QRS duration with an irregular ventricular rhythm
Polymorphic VT with a normal QT interval
Most commonly seen in the context of acute coronary syndrome or myocardial ischemia but can also be
seen in structurally normal hearts. In the context of myocardial infarction, the development of polymorphic
VT is suggestive of ongoing ischemia; treatment is focused at the underlying ischemia. Ion channelopathies
can present with polymorphic VT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT occurs in the absence of structural
heart disease and often presents as stress- or exercise-induced syncope, or sudden death in childhood or
adolescence. A variety of genetic causes have been identified, one of which involves an autosomal dominant
mutation in the gene for the cardiac ryanodine receptor.[43] Less commonly, an autosomal recessive
mutation in the cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) has been associated with this condition. Both of these
gene mutations are associated with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.[44]

Evaluation of tachycardia Theory
Polymorphic VT associated with a prolonged QT (observed during sinus rhythm) with a characteristic
"twisting on axis" morphology. The prolonged QT may be congenital or acquired. Acquired long-QT
syndrome is more commonly observed clinically. It may be secondary to medications known to prolong the
QT interval,  [AZCERT: QT drugs list] (https://www.crediblemeds.org/everyone/composite-list-all-qtdrugs) 
ischemia, significant electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), or massive
injury to the central nervous system.[43] [45]
Bidirectional VT
A rare but potentially fatal arrhythmia most often caused by digitalis toxicity but also seen in
catecholaminergic polymorphic VT and Andersen-Tawil syndrome (long QT 7). It is characterized by two
alternating QRS morphologies (often a right bundle branch block with alternating left and right axis). Contrary
to ventricular bigeminy, the R-R interval in bidirectional VT is regular.[34]
Atrial fibrillation with ventricular preexcitation
Patients with atrial fibrillation and an anterograde-conducting accessory pathway may present with a wide-
complex irregular tachycardia. Some patients may have anterograde conduction pathways with more rapid
properties than others and are therefore at greater risk of this arrhythmia. Identification of this arrhythmia is
vital because it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamic collapse. Preexcited atrial fibrillation is a
potentially life-threatening arrhythmia.[5]
Ventricular fibrillation
Rapid (rate >300 bpm), grossly irregular, life-threatening ventricular rhythm characterized by variable QRS
cycle length, morphology, and amplitude.[34]

Evaluation of tachycardia Emergencies
EMERGENCIES
Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
Cardiac arrest and hemodynamic instability: urgent cardioversion
Patients who suffer a cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), or
rapid VT require CPR and prompt defibrillation.[46] In this situation the chance of surviving the cardiac arrest
decreases by 7% to 10% for every 1-minute delay in defibrillation.[47] [48] [49]
Atrial fibrillation with ventricular preexcitation often requires immediate cardioversion because of the risk that
the arrhythmia will degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Long term anticoagulation should be considered
based on thromboembolic risk.[5]
In any situation where a tachycardia (regardless of the mechanism) is the cause of hemodynamic instability,
angina, syncope, or decompensated heart failure, the priority should be toward rapid termination of the
arrhythmia. In many cases (atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, supraventricular tachycardia, VT)
electrical cardioversion is the most efficient and reliable way to achieve sinus rhythm. It is useful to obtain a
rhythm strip during and immediately after cardioversion in the event of reinitiation of the rhythm.[47] [48]
Regular wide-complex or regular narrow-complex tachycardia with
hemodynamic stability: adenosine administration
In patients who are stable with a regular wide- or narrow-complex tachycardia, administration of adenosine is
a therapeutic intervention and can provide useful diagnostic information.[14]
Adenosine should be administered in a closely monitored setting, with the patient supine, and with
continuous ECG and hemodynamic monitoring.
Adenosine is metabolized rapidly by red blood cells and must therefore be given as a rapid bolus to be
effective.
Adenosine transiently slows the sinus node or atrial tachycardia and transiently slows or blocks conduction
in the atrioventricular (AV) node. Depending on the arrhythmia mechanism, adenosine may unmask the
underlying rhythm (atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia) or may terminate arrhythmias that are dependent on the
AV node (AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, AV reciprocating tachycardia).
Caution is required in the presence of atrial fibrillation and a possible accessory conduction pathway
because adenosine can precipitate preferential rapid accessory tract conduction and degeneration to
ventricular fibrillation.

Evaluation of tachycardia Diagnosis
Approach
The diagnostic approach to a patient with tachycardia focuses on rapid assessment of the clinical
consequences and careful evaluation to identify the mechanism of the arrhythmia and the setting in which it
is occurring (drug toxicity, structural heart disease, ischemia).
In the setting of hemodynamic instability, it is important that diagnostic maneuvers do not delay therapy
necessary to terminate the tachycardia.[1] [2] [50]
History
Often, patients with paroxysmal tachycardia will be asymptomatic at the time of evaluation. Symptoms
associated with tachycardia include palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, chest discomfort, and
dyspnea.
Details of the pattern of the symptoms should be obtained, such as regular or irregular palpitations, number
and frequency of episodes, potential triggers, whether the onset is abrupt or gradual, duration of symptoms,
and how the tachycardia terminates.
The history should also include an evaluation of potential stressors such as hypovolemia, infection, ischemia,
heart failure; the patient's medication regimen (including herbal supplements); a thorough history of
substance use or misuse (including caffeine, energy drinks, and other stimulants); and any family history of
arrhythmias or sudden death.
Presyncope and syncope associated with tachyarrhythmia and structural heart disease have a poor
prognosis and should prompt detailed questioning surrounding the event.
A history of gradual onset and termination is more common with sinus tachycardia and atrial tachycardia,
whereas an abrupt onset and termination is more common for reentrant tachycardias such as
supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). The ability to terminate the rhythm
abruptly with vagal maneuvers suggests that the reentrant rhythm circuit involves the AV node and is
associated with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia
(AVRT).[14]
It is important to note that a common misconception is that hemodynamic stability may help to “rule out” VT.
However, VT may commonly be tolerated hemodynamically and, in contrast, some atrial arrhythmias (for
example, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter conducting with a rapid ventricular rate) may be poorly tolerated.
Therefore, hemodynamic stability should not be a factor in distinguishing VT from atrial arrhythmias.
Physical exam
The standard physical exam is often unrevealing, particularly if the tachycardia is episodic and not ongoing at
the time of evaluation.
The physical exam should include a detailed cardiac examination to evaluate for valvular, congenital, and
other structural heart disease.
A careful evaluation for signs of cardiomyopathy should be performed because of the worse prognosis
of tachyarrhythmias associated with structural heart disease. This includes looking for S3 gallop, right
ventricular (RV) heave, laterally displaced point of maximal impulse, and other signs of heart failure (elevated
jugular venous pressure, lower-extremity edema).

Evaluation of tachycardia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
If the patient has the symptoms at the time of physical evaluation, determining whether the pulse is regular or
irregular can greatly assist with a diagnosis. Physical exam findings associated with AV dissociation such as
cannon A waves or variability in the intensity of S1 are highly suggestive of VT.[51]
Diagnostic studies: 12-lead ECG
The resting 12-lead ECG is the cornerstone of the standard evaluation of tachycardia.
Even if the patient does not have the tachyarrhythmia at the time of the ECG, one can evaluate for evidence
of prior myocardial infarction (pathologic Q waves), prolonged QT interval, ischemia, atrial or ventricular
enlargement or hypertrophy, and signs of preexcitation.
Evidence of preexcitation, evidenced by a widened QRS complex with a delta wave, should raise suspicion
for AVRT. The ECG should also be closely evaluated to rule out artifacts such as electrical interference or
movement of telemetry monitoring leads as a cause for the observed abnormality.
Artifact overlying sinus rhythm
From the collection of Robert W. Rho, MD; used with permission
If the patient is experiencing the tachyarrhythmia at the time of the ECG, the findings can be diagnostic.
Having determined whether the tachyarrhythmia has a narrow or wide QRS interval, one can apply the
appropriate diagnostic algorithm to develop a preliminary differential or diagnosis.[1] If P waves cannot be
seen, sometimes an esophageal lead can also be used to help determine the atrial:ventricular relationship
during tachycardia.[1] [2]
During the evaluation of a regular narrow-QRS-complex tachycardia (<120 ms), assessment of the response
to increased AV nodal blockade, either through carotid massage or with adenosine, can assist with the
differential diagnosis. Intravenous adenosine should be administered in a monitored setting and with a
continuous 12-lead ECG recording at the time of the maneuver. Absence of effect on ventricular rate, a
temporarily gradual slowing of ventricular rate, or sudden termination of the tachycardia may be helpful
in the diagnosis and can be therapeutic in some situations. Temporary AV block may unmask an atrial
tachyarrhythmia. If this is ineffective or not feasible and the patient is hemodynamically stable, intravenous
beta blocker or intravenous diltiazem or verapamil can be used.
For the evaluation of wide-QRS-complex tachycardia (>120 ms), differentiation between SVT and VT is
important because intravenous medications for SVT (verapamil or diltiazem) can have adverse and even
fatal consequences in a patient with VT. If differentiation between SVT and VT cannot be made, one should
suspect and treat as VT until proven otherwise, especially in a patient with structural heart disease.

Evaluation of tachycardia Diagnosis
A useful way to subcategorize SVTs is to assess the relationship between the P wave and the preceding R
wave. SVTs can be categorized into short-RP tachycardias (RP less than half the R-R interval) and long-RP
tachycardias (RP greater than half the R-R interval). Short-RP tachycardia with retrograde P waves usually
represents typical (slow-fast) AVNRT, AVRT, or atrial tachycardia with prolonged AV conduction. A long-RP
tachycardia usually represents permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia, atypical (fast-slow) AVNRT, or
an atrial tachycardia conducting with brisk AV node conduction.[1] [2]
Further diagnostic studies
Monitoring devices
• If the patient has frequent (several per day) episodes of the presumed tachyarrhythmia but is not
experiencing the rhythm at the time of evaluation, an ambulatory 24- or 48-hour Holter recording can
be used.
• If the episodes are less frequent and would be unlikely to occur during a 24- to 48-hour monitoring
period, an event or wearable loop recorder can be used.[52] [53]
• If episodes occur rarely (<2 episodes per month) and are associated with hemodynamic instability
or syncope (in which case activation of an event monitor is unlikely), an implantable loop recorder is
appropriate and has been shown to be effective.[50]
• If the patient already has a pacemaker or defibrillator in place, interrogation of the device may greatly
assist with diagnosis.[5]
Direct to consumer technologies
• Wearable and remote ECG-recording devices may be used by patients outside of a medical setting to
provide single/multi-lead ECGs.[54] [55] Some devices may not be approved as medical devices.
• Clinicians should be prepared to discuss results generated using these technologies, and understand
their risks and limitations.[56]
• The 12-lead ECG remains the gold standard for the detection and evaluation of tachycardia.
Imaging
• Imaging is not required in all cases and its use depends on the nature of the suspected
tachyarrhythmia and the patient's overall clinical presentation.
• Indications for echocardiography include wide-complex tachycardia of unknown origin, documented
sustained atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, SVT), or findings on history or physical exam
that suggest structural heart disease.[57]
Exercise testing
• Exercise testing may be helpful in defining the association of the arrhythmia to exercise, in provoking
the arrhythmia, and in ruling out significant coronary artery disease, if appropriate.
• If the arrhythmia is provoked during the study, the onset, termination, and a full 12-lead ECG of the
arrhythmia is provided.
• The exercise stress test is particularly helpful in provoking VT in patients suspected to have right
ventricular outflow tract VT.
Electrophysiology testing
• A diagnostic electrophysiologic study (EPS) is a useful tool for clarifying the mechanism of sustained
and nonsustained supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. In wide-complex tachycardias where

the diagnosis is uncertain, a diagnostic EPS can be helpful in establishing whether the arrhythmia
is supraventricular or ventricular in origin. In addition to the diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias, several
arrhythmias can be successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation at the time of the EPS.
• Indications for referral to a cardiac arrhythmia specialist for EPS include, but are not limited to:
• Unknown wide-complex tachycardias
• Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (preexcitation with arrhythmia)
• History of MI with history or symptoms suggestive of VT.
Laboratory testing
• Baseline laboratory evaluation should be targeted toward the patient's overall clinical picture. But a
number of tests should be included:
• Blood electrolytes: particularly potassium, magnesium, and calcium; hypovolemia, which can
manifest as prerenal azotemia or orthostatic hypotension, can cause sinus tachycardia
• CBC: to determine if anemia is a contributing factor
• Thyroid function tests: particularly if hyperthyroidism is in the differential diagnosis; results are
often normal
• Cardiac biomarkers: for patients who present with chest pain, have significant risk factors for
ischemic heart disease, or are otherwise unstable; can show whether ischemia or infarction are
contributing factors.
• Drug levels: drug toxicity should be considered, particularly for patients who are on digitalis or
who present with closely associated rhythms such as bi-directional VT or atrial tachycardia with
AV block
• Toxicology screen: for stimulants such as cocaine or tricyclic antidepressants.

new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
