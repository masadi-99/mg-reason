Evaluation of chest pain Overview
Summary
Chest pain is a common chief complaint, accounting for approximately 5.6% of all emergency department
visits in the US per year.[1] It is the presenting complaint in approximately 0.5% of office-based visits.[2]
Chest pain may be caused by either benign or life-threatening etiologies, and is usually divided into cardiac
and noncardiac causes.
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS; encompassing unstable angina, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) may not be the most common etiology in patients presenting with
chest pain. Excluding ACS is, however, vital because of the mortality associated with untreated myocardial
infarction.
This topic concentrates on the evaluation of acute chest pain in the emergency setting.

THEORY
Etiology
A retrospective study in the US, conducted over a 5-year period, of patients aged over 35 years, with a chief
complaint of nontraumatic chest pain admitted to the hospital from the emergency department, found that
chest pain most frequently had a coronary cause.[3] Pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection were rare but
important causes.[3]
Distribution of final diagnoses in people over 35 years admitted to the hospital from one US hospital emergency
department with chief complaint of nontraumatic chest pain, over a 5-year period (PE, pulmonary embolism)
Created by BMJ; based on data from Kohn MA, Kwan E, Gupta M, et al. Prevalence
of acute myocardial infarction and other serious diagnoses in patients presenting to an
urban emergency department with chest pain. J Emerg Med. 2005 Nov;29(4):383-90
Data from emergency departments in Northern Europe indicate that approximately 10% to 12% of patients
presenting with chest pain will receive a diagnosis of unstable angina or myocardial infarction.[4] [5]
Reports have indicated that up to 3.5% of patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome have the
diagnosis missed in the emergency department.[6] [7] [8]

The distribution of etiologies is different in primary care. Common etiologies of chest pain in this setting
include:[9] [10]
• Musculoskeletal causes
• Reflux esophagitis
• Costochondritis.
An observational study found most final diagnoses in people presenting with chest pain in primary care are
nonlife-threatening; however, 8.4% have a life-threatening final diagnosis.[11]
Another study in primary health care found that most patients had no diagnosis assigned at presentation
(72.4%) or within the next 6 months following a first episode of chest pain (no previous record of
cardiovascular disease).[12] Those patients who had no diagnosis attributed to their chest pain at 6 months
had higher long-term incidence of cardiovascular events compared with patients who had been diagnosed
with noncoronary pain.

Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
Acute chest pain warrants rapid clinical assessment, as underlying disease can be life-threatening.[13]
Continuous monitoring of pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation is standard care. Use a C-A-B
(circulation, airway, breathing) approach to systematically assess and treat the patient. Treat life-threatening
problems before moving onto the next part of the assessment.[14] [15] [16]
Recommendations regarding supplemental oxygen and target ranges may vary depending on each
guideline and/or disorder. One systematic review and meta-analysis found that the liberal use of oxygen
was associated with increased mortality in acutely ill patients when compared with a conservative oxygen
strategy.[17] [18]
Supplemental oxygen has not been proven to be helpful and may be harmful in patients with acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) who have normal oxygen saturations.[19] [20] Guidelines recommend that oxygen should
not be routinely administered in normoxic patients with suspected or confirmed ACS.[20][21][22]
European guidelines do not recommend oxygen routinely if the oxygen saturation is ≥90% for patients with
presumed ACS.[23] British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend a target oxygen saturation of 94%
to 98% for most acutely ill patients, or 88% to 92% (or a patient-specific target range) for those at risk of
hypercapnic respiratory failure.[24]
Opiates (e.g., morphine) may be necessary to relieve severe pain.
Immediate investigations include a 12-lead ECG, chest x-ray, cardiac biomarkers, complete blood count,
and renal profile.[20] [23] [25] The patient may need to be transferred to an intensive care setting. Once the
patient is stable, further tests such as computed tomography, echocardiography or angiography should be
requested to confirm the diagnosis. 
Acute coronary syndrome
ACS refers to acute myocardial ischemia caused by atherosclerotic coronary disease and includes ST-
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI, and unstable angina.[26] These terms are used as a
framework for guiding management.
Patients with STEMI need to be urgently assessed, as they may have life-threatening arrhythmias,
cardiogenic shock, or pulmonary edema. STEMI typically presents with a severe central chest pressure
radiating to the jaw or upper extremities. There can be associated nausea and vomiting. The treatment is
anticoagulation and acute reperfusion therapy with angioplasty (if available within 2 hours) or thrombolytics (if
no contraindications and angioplasty not available).[20] [22][23][26][27] [28]
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)
An unusual, but important cause of ACS. SCAD is defined as a separation of the layers of an epicardial
coronary artery wall by intramural hemorrhage, with or without an intimal tear, and usually presents with
chest pain that often radiates to the arms, shoulders or back.[29] It is not associated with trauma, iatrogenic
injury, or atherosclerosis. Approximately 90% of patients with SCAD are women ages 47 to 53 years.[29]
 SCAD causes approximately 15% to 20% of myocardial infarctions during pregnancy and the peripartum
period.[29] [30] [31]

Evaluation of chest pain Emergencies
Patients with SCAD most often present with STEMI or NSTEMI, with only a minority presenting with
ventricular dysrhythmias.[29] [32] Diagnosis of SCAD is made by coronary angiography. SCAD is generally
managed medically. Due to the pathophysiology, patients with SCAD treated with percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) may have worse outcomes.[32] Thrombolytic use is not recommended and anticoagulation
should generally be discontinued once SCAD is diagnosed. Patients with SCAD should receive dual
antiplatelet therapy acutely and for a year afterwards.[29] [33] Beta-blockers appear to be the most useful in
both treatment and prevention of recurrence of SCAD.[29] [34] [35]
Aortic dissection
Aortic dissection typically presents with sudden, severe pain described as a tearing sensation radiating to
the mid-back. A chest x-ray may show a widened mediastinum. Computed tomography chest scan with
intravenous contrast or transesophageal echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis.
Patients should immediately receive intravenous beta-blockade for heart rate and blood pressure control.[36]
 Additional titratable vasodilators may be required.[36]
Definitive management depends on the type of aortic dissection and includes urgent surgical replacement or
ongoing medical therapy. Uncomplicated dissections involving the ascending aorta (Stanford A) are generally
managed surgically and necessitate urgent surgical consultation. Uncomplicated dissections involving solely
the descending aorta (Stanford B) are generally managed medically. Complicated Stanford B dissections
may be managed endovascularly.[13] [37]
Tension pneumothorax
Tension pneumothorax occurs when there is a disruption of the tissues of the lung or pleura causing a one-
way valve that lets air enter, but not exit, the pleural space. In severe cases, the tension pneumothorax
causes mediastinal shift with compression of the great vessels, reducing blood flow to the heart, leading to
shock. Tension pneumothorax may begin as acute, sharp, pleuritic pain. Needle decompression followed by
tube thoracostomy should be done immediately to prevent acute decompensation.
Pulmonary embolism
Pulmonary embolism (PE) typically presents with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Hemoptysis
occurs less commonly. Patients who have a high-risk (hemodynamically unstable) PE will have features
of hypotension, shock, or tachycardia, and can be hypoxemic at rest. Computed tomographic pulmonary
angiography and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan are key diagnostic modalities.[41]
Patients with suspected PE can be classified into distinct categories of clinical (pretest) probability that
correspond to confirmed PE prevalence using the original Wells Criteria (modified), simplified Wells Criteria
(modified), original Geneva Score (revised), or the simplified Geneva Score (revised).[42] [43] [44] Each
of these clinical decision tools assigns a value (a single point, or points) to a series of historic and physical
exam features, the sum of which determines whether PE is likely or unlikely.
Cardiac tamponade
Cardiac tamponade may occur suddenly as a result of trauma, aortic dissection, or gradual accumulation
of fluid in the pericardial space. Early recognition and appropriate drainage of pericardial fluid is vital. The
condition can present with muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins, and pulsus paradoxus. Diagnosis is
made by point-of-care ultrasonography or transthoracic echocardiography. Patients presenting in shock from
tamponade require emergency pericardiocentesis.[45]

Evaluation of chest pain Diagnosis
Approach
Patients with chest pain can be triaged according to whether the etiology is traumatic or atraumatic. The
evaluation of atraumatic chest pain requires an algorithmic approach that first excludes acute myocardial
ischemia before working through the various etiologies of chest pain. It is important to check whether the
patient still has pain, and if not, to find out when his or her last episode of pain occurred.[21]
History
The character of chest pain can help differentiate between cardiac, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and other
causes. The type, severity, location, and duration of pain; the presence of any radiation; and exacerbating or
relieving factors may be helpful in pointing toward a diagnosis.[13]
Clinical presentation alone cannot reliably determine acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[46] [47]
Certain characteristics of chest pain can give clues to the origin.
• Constricting pain may be due to cardiac ischemia or esophageal spasm.
• Pain that lasts over 15 minutes and is dull, central, and crushing is a feature of ACS.
• Pain that radiates to the jaw or upper extremities suggests a cardiac cause.[48]
• Pain that is new in onset, or a change to the usual pattern in a patient with previously stable angina,
including recurrent episodes occurring frequently with little or no exertion, or lasting longer than 15
minutes, suggests possible ACS.[21]
• Sharp pleuritic pain that catches on inspiration may originate from the pleura or pericardium and
suggests pneumonia, pulmonary embolus, or pericarditis.
• A sudden substernal tearing pain that radiates toward the back is the classic presentation of aortic
dissection.
Precipitating and relieving factors can help distinguish between cardiac and gastrointestinal causes (e.g.,
GERD, peptic ulcer disease, esophageal spasm). Cardiac pain is more likely to be brought on by exercise or
emotion and is typically relieved with rest or nitrates. However, response to nitroglycerin should not be used
to make a diagnosis.[21] Pain brought on by food, lying down, hot drinks, or alcohol, and relieved by antacids
suggests a gastrointestinal cause. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are typical symptoms of GERD.[49]
Abdominal pathology, such as acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis, may also cause pain referred to the
chest. Associated symptoms may help to narrow the diagnosis. Acute cholecystitis may cause symptoms of
fever, nausea, vomiting, persistent severe right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice. Acute pancreatitis pain is
typically sudden in onset, constant, may radiate to the back, and worsens with movement. The onset of pain
is sudden and is associated with vomiting in 80% of cases.[50]
Dyspnea is an associated symptom in patients with cardiac ischemia, pulmonary embolism (PE),
pneumothorax, or pneumonia. Nausea, vomiting, and sweating may be seen in patients with ACS.
Some patients with ACS may present with atypical symptoms: presyncope/syncope, nausea and vomiting,
or dyspnea in the absence of chest pain. This occurs more commonly in women, people with diabetes, and
those aged 75 years or more.[13] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57]
Past medical history and specific cardiac risk factors, such as known cardiac disease, elevated cholesterol,
hypertension, smoking, and family history, support a cardiac cause.[58] In women, preeclampsia, gestational
diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause and autoimmune diseases increase the risk of

cardiovascular disease.[59] It is helpful to determine if the patient has had any previous investigations or
treatment for chest pain.[21]
A detailed drug history, prescribed and illicit, should be taken. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
may result in a gastric cause of pain due to gastritis, gastric ulcer, or duodenitis. Cocaine use makes cardiac
ischemia more likely.[13] [60]
Physical exam
Physical exam can further narrow down the differential.
Patients with chest pain may present in acute shock, such as those with:
• Tension pneumothorax
• Cardiac tamponade
• Massive PE
• ACS with cardiogenic shock
• Pancreatitis
• Sepsis from pneumonia or cholecystitis
• Esophageal rupture.
Findings revealed in the cardiac exam include abnormalities in pulse or heart sounds (e.g., new onset
of aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or worsening of existing murmur, pericardial friction rub), hypo- or
hypertension, and signs of heart failure.
Cardiac exam is often normal in ACS.
Aortic dissection may cause a pulse deficit, indicated by reduced pulse force or volume, or clinical signs
of hypoperfusion (e.g., cold, blue, mottled limb) affecting the extremities.[61] This is particularly common
in a proximal dissection affecting the aortic arch, and may be unilateral or bilateral. Interarm systolic blood
pressure differences of more than 20 mmHg may be present with aortic dissection; however, this may also be
an incidental finding in hypertensive individuals without aortic dissection.[62] [63]
Crepitations on auscultation in one or both bases suggest pneumonia or heart failure. Reduced breath
sounds on one side can be caused by a pneumothorax, or focally due to a collapsed lobe.
Tenderness on palpation over the area of chest pain usually indicates a musculoskeletal cause, such as
costochondritis. However, many patients with myocardial infarction also have chest wall pain on presentation.
Tenderness unilaterally, in a dermatomal distribution (with or without the typical rash), may be indicative
of herpes zoster. The pain typically presents 2 to 3 days before the development of a rash in the affected
dermatome. However, some patients present with pain for up to 28 days before development of a rash.[64]
 Typically, the rash is vesicular on an erythematous base in a unilateral distribution of one dermatome.

A gastrointestinal origin of chest pain is associated with a normal cardiac and respiratory exam, unless there
is existing but stable comorbidity. An abnormal abdominal exam (tenderness, rebound, guarding) makes a
gastrointestinal etiology more likely. Possible disorders include: GERD, peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis,
pancreatitis, and gastritis. In acute cholecystitis, physical exam may reveal a right upper quadrant mass. A
positive Murphy sign (the examiner’s hand rests on the right costal margin and deep inspiration causes pain)
has a specificity of 96% for acute cholecystitis.[65]
Features of a connective tissue disease such as Marfan syndrome (tall stature, arachnodactyly, pectus
excavatum, joint hypermobility, high-arched palate and narrow face) or type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
(translucent skin, easy bruising, small joint hypermobility) may be present in patients with aortic
dissection.[36]
Unilateral leg tenderness or swelling may indicate a deep vein thrombosis in patients with suspected PE.
Basic investigations
Basic vital sign checks include temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. In addition, the
following should be monitored, using clinical judgment on the frequency of monitoring required, until a firm
diagnosis has been made.[21]
• Heart rhythm
• Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry

DIAGNOSIS
• Repeated resting 12-lead ECGs
• Any exacerbations of pain and/or other symptoms
• Pain relief; checking that this is effective.
ECG
A 12-lead ECG is performed in most patients unless a noncardiac diagnosis can be made with confidence
(e.g., pneumothorax).[25] The ECG should be done as soon as possible after presentation.
• ST segment changes such as ST elevation or ST depression, QRS abnormalities, arrhythmias,
or tachycardia or bradycardia are characteristic findings in cardiac causes. ST segment elevation,
measured at the J point, >1 mm in contiguous leads, indicates ST-elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI). ST-wave depression or T wave inversion in contiguous leads may indicate coronary
ischemia. Patients with ACS may have normal or nearly normal ECGs; where there is concern for
ACS, serial ECGs should be performed.[66]

• Pericarditis may be present with diffuse ST elevation or PR depression.[67]
• ECG findings that may be present in patients with PE include sinus tachycardia (most commonly) and
S wave in lead I with Q wave and T wave inversion in lead III (S I, Q III, T III pattern).
• Patients with pericardial tamponade may demonstrate electrical alternans (alternate-beat variation in
the amplitude or axis of the QRS complex).
Chest x-ray
• A chest x-ray can confirm respiratory disorders such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pneumonia.
• The chest x-ray is usually normal in ACS.
• Chest x-ray can provide clues to another serious cardiac pathology, such as a widened mediastinum in
aortic dissection, or a large globular heart in cardiac tamponade.[25] [68]

Blood tests
• In patients with concern for ACS, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) guidelines advocate high-sensitivity cardiac troponins as the preferred standard for
establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.[13] [25]
• Cardiac biomarkers should be ordered on presentation; repeat measurements are made every 1-3
hours for high-sensitivity troponin assays.[13]
• High-sensitivity troponins may allow for earlier diagnosis of ACS.[69] Patients with a nonischemic ECG
and a negative high-sensitivity troponin T, particularly if they have had pain for over 3 hours, have a
very low risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE).[66] [70] [71]
• Creatine kinase (CK) should only be used if troponin is unavailable. Biotin (vitamin B7) supplements
may interfere with the results of some troponin assays, leading to falsely low results.[72]
• ACC/AHA guidelines state that urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is
not needed in low risk patients.[13] In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence

recommends that high-sensitivity troponin tests should not be used in people in whom ACS is not
suspected.[21]
• One cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department with chest pain but no
ACS found that any elevation of high-sensitivity troponin was associated with an increased risk of
cardiovascular events and death over a mean follow-up of three years.[73] Another cohort study of
patients who had troponin testing for any clinical reason found that any elevation of troponin was
associated with a clinically significant increase in mortality, regardless of age.[74]
• A complete blood count should be considered to screen for anemia and evidence of infection.
• A renal profile is useful as a baseline test. Patients with impaired renal function frequently have
elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels.[75] [76] Patients with impaired renal function and elevated
troponins are at increased risk for major cardiac events.[13] [77]
Some of the differential diagnoses for chest pain can be excluded or confirmed after history, physical
exam, and basic investigations have been carried out. These include STEMI, pneumothorax, pneumonia,
pericarditis, and costochondritis.
Coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
• Coronary angiography with PCI is required urgently in patients with STEMI and in patients with
NSTEMI who have high-risk features such as ongoing chest pain and dynamic ECG changes.

• If PCI is unavailable or delayed more than 2 hours, then systemic fibrinolysis should be given for
STEMI. Fibrinolytic therapy is not indicated in patients with NSTEMI.[20]
Risk stratification
The HEART score has been developed for risk stratification of patients in the emergency department.
Patients with a low HEART score (0-3) have a low risk of MACE at 6 weeks. Patients with a high HEART
score (7-10) are at significant risk for MACE.[48] [78] [79] Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found
that the HEART score has a sensitivity of over 95% for predicting major adverse cardiac events.[80] [81] [82]

Composition of the HEART score for chest pain patients in the emergency department
Six AJ, et al. Neth Heart J. 2008;16:191-6; used with permission
There are many other risk scores available. Guidelines vary in their recommendations on risk stratification in
people presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department.[25] [66] [83]
Further investigations
Some patients need further investigations to confirm the suspected diagnosis.
Evaluating risk of angina and coronary artery disease
Once ACS, ventricular arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability are excluded, patients with chest pain that
is clinically considered to be ischemic in origin can be stratified by their likelihood of having angina and risk
for coronary artery disease (CAD).[84] [85][86] [87] [88] [89] Patients who are at intermediate to high pretest
risk of obstructive coronary artery disease will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing.[13]
1. High pretest probability of CAD (>90%): should be referred for coronary angiography.[90] Fractional
flow reserve (FFR) CT is being increasingly used to clarify the functional significance of stenoses,
particularly when intervention is being considered without prior functional testing. FFRCT is a
noninvasive, post-processing image analysis technique that allows assessment of flow limitation

across coronary stenoses by using data derived from routine diagnostic coronary computed
tomography (CT) angiography studies.[91] [92]
2. Intermediate pretest probability of CAD (10-90%): should have stress testing with imaging
(radionuclide, echocardiography, or magnetic resonance imaging) or coronary CT angiography.[13]
3. Low pretest probability of CAD (<10%): if the patient has an interpretable ECG (not left bundle branch
block, preexcitation [Wolff-Parkinson-White], or ventricular paced rhythm) and is able to exercise,
he or she should have an exercise stress test. Otherwise the patient should have a stress test with
imaging.[84]
Guidelines differ in their recommendations on use of risk stratification and further specific investigations so
it's important to check local protocols.
Patients without symptoms of angina should be evaluated for alternative causes of chest pain.
Transthoracic echocardiography is a noninvasive way of assessing cardiac function. It is necessary if cardiac
tamponade is suspected and is helpful in confirming a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, pericarditis,
aortic stenosis, and mitral valve prolapse.[93]
Imaging studies for suspected aortic pathology
CT angiography allows rapid imaging and detection of life-threatening aortic pathology (e.g., aortic
dissection).[36] Magnetic resonance aortography has a sensitivity and specificity equivalent to CT.
This imaging modality also provides information on aortic valve pathology and left ventricular function,
but the images take longer to acquire so it is only suitable for hemodynamically stable patients.[94] A
transesophageal echocardiogram is an alternative if a dissection-skilled operator is readily available.[68]
Assessing probability of pulmonary embolism
If there is low clinical suspicion of PE, and the patient satisfies the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria
(the PERC rule), the risk of PE is considered to be lower than the risk of testing.[95] [96] [97] [98]
If there is high clinical suspicion of PE, or the patient does not satisfy the PERC rule, the Wells (or Geneva)
Score may be used to categorize the patient as:
• "PE likely" (Wells Score >4); D-dimer testing is not recommended because a negative result will not
remove the need for definitive imaging (usually computed tomographic pulmonary angiography [CTPA]
if available)[95] [98]
• "PE unlikely" (Wells Score ≤4); D-dimer test is ordered.[98] A normal plasma D-dimer level safely
excludes PE in patients with an unlikely pretest probability of PE and no further investigation is
required.[95]
D-dimer blood testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has a sensitivity and negative
predictive value >95%, regardless of the calculated clinical probability, making it useful to rule out the
presence of venous thromboembolism. However, specificity is much lower, with estimates from 23% to 63%.
It is particularly useful in patients with a low or intermediate clinical probability assessment.[99] [100] [101]
There is evidence to suggest that age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs or D-dimer testing adjusted to clinical
probability may be effective, but these approaches are not in widespread clinical use.[42] [102]

Evaluation of chest pain Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Highly specific for diagnosing pneumothorax, pleural effusion and pericardial effusion in the emergency
department.[103] When evaluating patients with dyspnea, POCUS has demonstrated increased sensitivity
compared with chest x-ray.[104] POCUS decreases time to appropriate treatment in medical patients.[105]
 POCUS has been reported to be significantly more sensitive for the diagnosis of heart failure, but not for that
of COPD/asthma or pulmonary embolism, compared with standard evaluations for these conditions.[106]
Investigations for suspected gastric etiology
If a gastric diagnosis is the more likely cause for chest pain, then investigations such as
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal pH monitoring, esophageal manometry, barium swallow, and 
Helicobacter pylori  breath test can be considered. A therapeutic trial of proton-pump inhibitors can relieve
symptoms in patients with GERD, once cardiac causes of the chest pain have been ruled out.[107]
Further blood tests such as liver profile and either serum lipase or amylase may be necessary if acute
cholecystitis or acute pancreatitis is suspected.[108] These diagnoses may also require further imaging such
as abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT (for acute pancreatitis).[108]

providing a higher
likelihood of picking
up the diagnosis in
patients with a delayed
presentation.[125]
Up to one quarter
of people with acute
pancreatitis have
lipase/amylase levels
that remain within the
normal range, leading
to a risk of missing
the diagnosis.[125]
 The patient should
be admitted and
treated as having acute
pancreatitis, even if
these tests are normal,
if there is a suspicion of
acute pancreatitis.
As about 1 in 10
patients without acute
pancreatitis may be
wrongly diagnosed
as having acute
pancreatitis with these
tests, it is important
to consider other
conditions that require
urgent surgery, even
if these tests are
abnormal.[125]
The diagnostic
performance of these
tests decreases with
time, and additional
investigations should
be performed if there
cause, such as
gallstones
Abdominal imaging
is not needed for
diagnosis in most
patients. However, once
a diagnosis of acute
pancreatitis has been
made, transabdominal
ultrasound is required
to rule out gallstones as
the etiology.[108]
»abdominal CT
scan: stage the
severity of the
pancreatitis; pancreatic
necrosis; pseudocyst
Abdominal imaging
is not needed for
diagnosis in most
patients. Necrosis
generally takes around
5 days to develop,
so an early CT scan
cannot be used to
assess disease
severity.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To

quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
