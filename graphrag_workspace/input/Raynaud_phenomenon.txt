Raynaud phenomenon Overview
Summary
Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is common, affecting between 3% and 5% of the population.
The diagnosis is made clinically: digits turn white (pallor) then blue with deoxygenation and/or red with
reperfusion; pallor is well demarcated.
Primary RP often needs no pharmacologic treatment. Keeping warm, smoking cessation, regular exercise,
and avoiding stress are recommended. Pharmacologic treatment can be considered in people with mild
disease who do not respond to lifestyle measures. Potential treatment options include calcium-channel
blockers, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), topical nitrates,
alpha-blockers, and ACE inhibitors.
Secondary RP can be severe, especially when associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Other underlying
conditions, exposures, or drugs can also cause secondary RP. In severe secondary RP, calcium-channel
blockers, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclins, atorvastatin, and bosentan are potential treatment
options, with only the most severe cases warranting surgical intervention.
Complications in secondary RP include severe digital ischemia, gangrene, digital ulcers, and infection.
Pain relief and wound care of digital ulcers may be important adjunctive treatments.
Definition
Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is characterized by vasospasm that causes digits to change color to white
(pallor) from lack of blood flow, usually brought on by cold temperatures. Affected areas subsequently turn
blue due to deoxygenation and/or red due to reperfusion. Both primary and secondary RP can be painful;
however, secondary RP can lead to complications from prolonged periods of ischemia.

Raynaud phenomenon Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Meta-analysis of observational studies suggests a primary RP prevalence of approximately 3% to 5% in the
general population.[3] The lowest prevalence was found in Japan (1.6%) and the highest in the US (7.5%).
The pooled annual incidence of primary RP was 0.25%.[3]
RP is more common in women and in colder climates.[4]
Etiology
RP is highly heritable, with reported estimates ranging from 55% to 64%.[5] A large genome-wide
association study identified three genomic regions associated with RP, implicating three genes: ADRA2A,
IRX1, and to a lesser extent MICB.[5] People with gene variants at these loci may have a higher risk of
developing RP. In primary or secondary RP, a family history of RP or connective tissue disease may be
present.[3]
Primary or idiopathic RP
The cause of primary RP is not fully understood. Vasospasm is a normal reaction to cold or temperature
change, but this is exaggerated in primary RP. It has been suggested that this dysfunction in
thermoregulation is due to genetic factors resulting in the overexpression and overactivity of alpha-2
adrenergic receptors, ultimately leading to extreme vasoconstriction.[2] [5]
The association with primary RP and other vasospastic conditions such as migraines and Prinzmetal variant
coronary angina suggests a common cause.[2] [3][6]
Secondary RP
Secondary RP is associated with an underlying cause such as an underlying medical condition,
environmental exposure, or specific drugs.[2]
Underlying conditions:
• Autoimmune connective tissue disease (ACTD), especially systemic sclerosis (SSc), scleroderma, or
inflammatory myositis
• Other rheumatologic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, vasculitis)
• Vascular occlusive diseases (e.g., Buerger disease)
• Hematologic syndromes
• Malignancy
• Infections
• Peripheral vascular disease.
See Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) , Rheumatoid arthritis , Sjogren syndrome , and Buerger disease .
Environmental exposures:
• Vibration injury (from tools e.g., jackhammers)
• Frostbite.
See Frostbite .

Raynaud phenomenon Theory
• Beta-blockers
• Migraine therapies (e.g., clonidine, ergotamine)
• Chemotherapy (e.g., bleomycin, cisplatin, vinblastine)
• Cyclosporine
• Stimulants (e.g., caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines).
Environmental exposure-related secondary RP is different from others in that there is not necessarily a fixed
defect of the vascular walls of arteries/arterioles, whereas in other secondary RP there are potentially more
exaggerated vascular abnormalities and endothelial dysfunction.[8] [9]
Pathophysiology
Normal thermoregulation in response to cold temperatures involves a decrease in blood flow through
arteriovenous (AV) anastomoses, and this is mediated by alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in these vessels.
In both primary and secondary RP, the overexpression and overactivity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors
results in decreased nitrous oxide concentrations in the vascular smooth muscle, resulting in extreme
vasoconstriction and consequently pallor, cyanosis, and/or rubor.[2] [5][10] [11][12] Thermoregulatory
responses are exaggerated in acral skin, and RP therefore usually appears on the fingers and toes, and
more rarely the ears, nose, tongue, nipples, or the entire hand/arm or foot/leg.[2]
One genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests that variants in the ADRA2A gene region cause
increased expression of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in arterial tissue.[5]
Classification
The classification of RP into two clinical subtypes helps distinguish patients with dysregulation of the
thermoregulatory pathway (primary RP) from those who experience altered vascular reactivity due to an
underlying causative process (secondary RP).[1]
Primary or idiopathic RP[2]
RP not associated with an underlying cause. Although primary RP can be exacerbated by environmental
factors (e.g., cold exposure, stress, drugs), it follows a nonprogressive course, and the clinical manifestations
are reversible and usually do not result in tissue damage.
Secondary RP[2]
RP associated with an underlying cause. Secondary RP may lead to progressively severe clinical
manifestations, resulting in permanent tissue damage when left untreated. Several causes have been
associated with secondary RP. See Etiology .
Case history
Case history #1
An 18-year-old healthy woman presents with fingertips that turn white, then blue and red, in the cold. She
is otherwise well and is a nonsmoker. Her symptoms have been occurring for 3 years. Her mother has RP.

THEORY
The remainder of her history and physical exam is unremarkable. She has a normal complete blood count
and a negative antinuclear antibody. She has primary RP.
Case history #2
A 50-year-old woman has developed puffy hands, new RP, and difficulties swallowing over the last year.
Her chest and abdominal exams are unremarkable. She does not have inflammatory arthritis. She has
some small dot-like telangiectasia on her hands and lips. Her antinuclear antibody is positive and has a
nucleolar pattern. There are dilated capillaries seen at the nailbed, proximal to the nail, on several fingers.
She currently has a digital ulcer. She has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).
Other presentations
RP causes pain, discomfort, and sometimes paresthesia. Rarely, ulcers on the fingers and toes occur
(and much less commonly on the ears, nose, hand, wrist, or forearm). More severe cases usually occur
only when RP is secondary to an underlying cause, in particular connective tissue disorders such as
systemic sclerosis (SSc), scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid
arthritis, or polymyositis. Secondary RP is associated with vasculitis, severe peripheral vascular disease
(such as Buerger disease), and rarely malignancy or chemotherapy. Environmental trauma (e.g.,
excessive vibration exposure in jackhammer operators, frostbite) can also precipitate RP. In medium-
vessel vasculitis disorders such as polyarteritis nodosa and occasionally systemic lupus erythematosus,
gangrene of the fingertip or entire finger may occur.

Raynaud phenomenon Diagnosis
Approach
The workup should include:
• Clinical symptoms compatible with Raynaud phenomenon (RP)
• A history to determine the frequency/severity of the attacks
• Smoking history
• Review of systems
• Family history of RP and other connective tissue disease
• Physical exam focusing on features of RP and associated connective tissue disease
• Investigations may include CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein,
antinuclear antibody (ANA), and urinalysis
• Referral to a rheumatologist or other specialist if necessary (i.e., for determining if RP is secondary to
a connective tissue disease and/or help with respect to treatment in severe RP).
History
RP is diagnosed following a thorough history eliciting features of pallor of digits with subsequent cyanosis
and/or rubor. It is normal for digits to turn mottled or cyanotic in the cold; pallor should be present to make
the diagnosis. The history should focus on:
• The location (fingertips or tips of the toes are the most common)
• A clear demarcation of color change that usually is circumferential around the digit
• Cyanosis and/or rubor on rewarming.

From the personal collection of Dr Janet Pope; used with permission
Indicators of increased severity of RP are attacks in warm weather (without exposure to cold or air
conditioning), late onset RP (age >40 years), and the presence of complications such as digital ulcers.
A history of other systemic vasospasm symptoms such as migraine, irritable bowel, or anorexia may
indicate primary RP, as well as increased vasodilatory responses to stimuli such as warmth, alcohol, and
spicy food.[4]
A review of systems should rule out secondary causes such as connective tissue disease, which could
include inflammatory arthritis, prolonged morning stiffness (such as in metacarpophalangeal, radiocarpal,
and proximal interphalangeal joints), rash, photosensitivity, alopecia, significant dry eyes/dry mouth,
puffiness of fingers or tightness of the skin, or significant esophageal dysmotility/GERD.
A family history of RP and other connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjogren syndrome, polymyositis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis should
be sought. Other causes of secondary RP may be obvious, such as malignancy, chemotherapeutic

exposure, or severe peripheral vascular disease. Taking a clear drug and occupational history may also
help diagnose secondary RP.[4]
RP can be confused with other vascular diseases, but biphasic or triphasic color change is not present
in these conditions. Onset of primary RP is rare after 40 years of age and often begins in adolescence.
If the patient is young and has no signs/symptoms of connective tissue disease, primary RP should be
suspected. In this instance, a good history and physical exam are often sufficient.
Exam
Physical exam should include:
• An overview of general health and blood pressure (BP). Where asymmetrical RP is present, BP
should be checked in both arms.[4]
• Checking peripheral pulse to identify obstructive vascular disease. If RP sounds atypical (e.g.,
older age of onset of symptoms compatible with systemic disease), then blood pressure should
be checked in both arms to rule out major discrepancies between arms, and the presence of
carotid bruits should be checked. Giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, for example, can be
accompanied by large-vessel narrowing, which can affect blood pressure in a limb and can also
produce carotid bruits.
• Checking upper limb circulation to identify arterial occlusion. The Allen test should be performed
by asking the patient to clench their fist and raise their arm, and pressure should be applied to the
radial and ulnar arteries. Pressure should then be released one artery at a time, and color should
return to the hand when the patient opens their fingers. If pallor persists, this suggests occlusion of
the uncompressed artery.[4] An abnormal test in a young patient is suggestive of Buerger disease.
See Buerger disease .
• Checking for complications, including digital ulcers, digital pits (fibrotic plugs from ischemia), digital
tuft resorption, threatened ischemic digit, gangrene of the fingertip/entire finger, infection including
osteomyelitis, or autoamputation. These are strong signs of secondary RP.[4]
• A detailed skin exam to identify signs of an associated disorder (e.g., connective tissue disease),
which can include telangiectasia, sclerodactyly, dactylitis or synovitis, malar rash, splinter
hemorrhages, livedo reticularis, tightening of the skin in other areas (e.g., around the mouth), and
alopecia areata.[4] [6]

Secondary Raynaud phenomenon (RP) with sclerodactyly
From the personal collection of Dr Janet Pope; used with permission
Early diagnosis and management of concomitant connective tissue disease is crucial in improving
outcomes in RP.[4] The likelihood of underlying connective tissue disease increases when age of onset is
more than 40 years.
Investigations
In most cases, a good history and physical exam are sufficient for diagnosis. However, as secondary RP
may pre-date a connective tissue disease or may coincide with the onset of underlying conditions (e.g.,
diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis or polymyositis), all patients presenting with RP should undergo the
following tests when available:[4]
• ANA with titer and pattern
• CBC
• ESR or CRP
• Urinalysis.

Capillary microscopy is usually not performed in primary care, but early referral to a rheumatologist who
can perform this is recommended to exclude connective tissue disease.[4]
Follow-up should take place if a patient has:
• Strongly positive ANA
• Dilated capillaries at the nailbed
• An uncommon ANA pattern such as an anticentromere pattern
• An elevated ESR and/or CRP (less predictive).
Visible dilated capillaries at the nailbed
From the personal collection of Dr Janet Pope; used with permission
Follow-up is necessary in these patients as 30% will develop a connective tissue disease within the next
5 years. In particular, an anticentromere antibody and/or dilated capillaries at the periungual region are
predictive for scleroderma.[28]
A referral to a rheumatologist should be considered if secondary RP is suspected, or if complications such
as digital ulcers are present. The presence of digital ulceration is generally thought to exclude a diagnosis
of primary RP, so a secondary cause should be sought if ulceration occurs.[4]

DIAGNOSIS
Rarely, RP can be caused by obstruction of blood flow by a cervical rib. This can be identified on chest x-
ray, although this investigation is not carried out routinely on patients with mild RP and is ordered only if
there is a high index of suspicion.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
digit pain/discomfort (common)
• Common presenting symptom.
digital paresthesia (common)
• Paresthesias can occur when the fingers are rewarming. However, paresthesias are common and
nonspecific, so RP would not be considered in a patient with hand paresthesias without a history of
well-demarcated pallor of fingers.[4]
pallor of digits (common)
• This must be present to diagnose primary and secondary RP.[29]
red and/or blue discoloration of digits (common)
• At least one must be present to diagnose primary RP and secondary RP.[29]
dilated capillaries at nailbeds (common)
• Occurs mainly in secondary RP; if present, secondary RP should be assumed until proven otherwise.
Dilated capillaries result from dropout of capillaries with secondary hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the

remaining blood vessels. On inspection, these capillaries can appear like discrete red pen marks and
are often seen around the cuticle.
•

well-defined discoloration (common)
• In all cases of RP there are well-defined areas of pallor, which then display cyanosis followed by
rubor.[29]
magnification of nailbeds (common)
• Presence of dilated capillaries at the nailbeds that look like red pen marks are often seen at the cuticle.
This finding is highly specific for secondary RP, although not sensitive. It helps to rule in secondary RP
if positive.[30]
Other diagnostic factors
heartburn (uncommon)
• May indicate secondary RP.
dysphagia (uncommon)
• May indicate secondary RP.

raised painful red lesions on finger tips (uncommon)
• Sometimes RP features are accompanied by chilblains (perniosis), but this is a separate condition
with red raised areas on tips of toes or fingers in the cold, often like frostbite. They may heal with
desquamation, may be painful, are often multiple, and may be cyclical.
autoamputation (uncommon)
• A recognized complication of RP. Nearly only in secondary RP.
Risk factors
Strong
female
• Primary RP is more common in women than in men.[2] [3]
• Secondary RP is more common in women (up to 9:1) in conditions such as systemic lupus
erythematosus, scleroderma, and other connective tissue diseases.
family history
• In primary or secondary RP, a family history of RP or connective tissue disease may be present.[2] [3]
connective tissue disease
• RP occurs in 20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 40% to 45% with systemic lupus
erythematosus, 13% to 17% with Sjogren syndrome, 10% with polymyositis, >80% with mixed
connective tissue disease, and >90% with scleroderma.[13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18][19]
use of certain drugs
• Drug-induced RP can be caused by various drugs including beta-blockers, clonidine, ergotamine,
certain chemotherapy (e.g., bleomycin, cisplatin, vincristine), cyclosporine, and stimulants (e.g.,
caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines). There are limited data available regarding the prevalence.[7]
vibration injury
• Prevalence of RP appears to increase with exposure to vibration in the workplace.[2] [20] [21]
• Vibration injury (also called hand-arm vibration syndrome) occurs from repeated use of vibrating
hand-held machinery. Jackhammer operation and other causes of vibration injury increase the risk
of developing RP.[22] It can cause numbness, tingling, and pain and may persist even after the
occupation ceases. It occurs more often with tools of a certain acceleration amplitude and if used for
longer duration. There is no diagnostic test, so the history and observed RP can be helpful.[23]
Buerger disease
• Up to 40% of patients with Buerger disease (also known as thromboangiitis obliterans) experience
RP.[6] Buerger disease involves repeated inflammation and thrombosis of digital arteries or arterioles.
Smoking is a major risk factor, and chewing tobacco is also a risk. It is more common in men and often
between the ages of 20 and 40 years.[24] See Buerger disease .

Raynaud phenomenon Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
There is minimal evidence on the comparative efficacy of treatment options for Raynaud phenomenon (RP),
and management varies depending on disease severity and symptoms.[4]
Treatment for primary or mild secondary RP usually consists of lifestyle changes and pharmacologic
therapies. Treatment for moderate to severe secondary RP may warrant additional pharmacologic therapies
or surgery if patients have progressed to digital ulceration or gangrene.
In all patients, if treatment is ineffective, if there is suspicion of connective tissue disease or another
underlying condition (secondary RP), or if treatment for severe secondary RP is needed (e.g., digital
ulceration or critical ischemia), referral to a rheumatologist is recommended.[4]
Lifestyle measures
Many cases of RP do not require pharmacologic treatment unless symptoms become severe.
Nonpharmacologic interventions should be considered first in primary or mild secondary RP and mainly
include preventative measures and avoidance of triggers, for instance:[4] [31]
• Keeping warm and avoiding damp (e.g., wear gloves, use hand warmers)
• Moisturizing dry skin
• Quitting smoking
• Avoiding injury to digits and vibration exposure
• Avoiding stress
• Withdrawal from vasoconstrictor drugs when possible
• Avoiding drugs known to exacerbate RP (e.g., beta-blockers, ergotamine, clonidine, cyclosporine,
caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines).
If dexterity limitations are reported, patients should undergo occupational therapy assessment for aids
(e.g., key holders).
Pharmacologic treatment can be considered in people with mild disease who do not respond to lifestyle
measures. Lifestyle measures should also be considered alongside pharmacologic treatment in people
with secondary RP who have progressed to digital ulceration. Additional recommendations include
moisturising the skin around ulcers, avoiding contact with cleaning agents, avoiding injury to digits,
avoiding manipulation of ulcers, wearing protective gloves, and promoting circulation through exercise.[32]
Pharmacologic treatments
Calcium-channel blockers
The goals of pharmacologic treatment are to decrease frequency, severity, and duration of attacks.
The recommended first-line pharmacologic treatment is calcium-channel blockers, which have been
shown to decrease the frequency/severity of attacks, often by 30%.[4] [33][34] [35]  Meta-analyses have
demonstrated that dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are effective in primary and secondary RP.
Recommended agents include nifedipine, nicardipine, and less well-studied agents, including amlodipine
or felodipine.[4] [35][36] [37][38]
Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem) can be offered if dihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers cannot be used or are ineffective.[4] [36][39]

Raynaud phenomenon Management
Calcium-channel blockers may not be effective in all patients and may have adverse effects such as
hypotension, lightheadedness, flushing, and ankle puffiness. Short-acting calcium-channel blockers
may cause orthostatic hypotension, and many people with RP are young and have normal-to-low blood
pressure. If the short-acting calcium-channel blocker is tolerated but not effective, then the dose can be
increased.[4]
Alternative vasodilators
There is a lack of evidence for the use of vasodilators other than calcium-channel blockers in RP.[40]
 However, when calcium-channel blockers have failed or are not tolerated, other vasodilators may be
trialed.[4] [35] [41]
Two studies have shown a reduction in RP attacks in patients treated with the angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist losartan, with one study showing improvement in RP symptoms compared with nifedipine.[42]
[43] [44]
The association between selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and RP is controversial.
Treatment with fluoxetine showed a decrease in frequency and severity of attacks in one randomized
trial.[45] However, other studies report that SSRIs may exacerbate RP symptoms.[7] [46]
Topical nitrates have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of attacks,
reducing ulcer size, lowering Raynaud’s Condition Score (RCS), and improving blood flow in several
randomized controlled trials; however, adverse effects such as headaches may limit their use.[47] [48]
[49] [50]
Treatment with the alpha-blocker prazosin has shown modest improvement in RP in three randomized
controlled trials; however, adverse effects may be common and no further trials have been conducted
since 1986.[51] [52] [53]
ACE inhibitors have also been used as alternatives to calcium-channel blockers but have shown
conflicting results.[44] A 2021 systematic review found that captopril and enalapril may increase the
frequency of attacks in primary RP.[40] A randomized controlled trial found that treatment with quinapril
showed no improvement in secondary RP attacks.[54]
Severe disease
Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil) can be used for patients
with moderate to severe secondary RP when calcium-channel blockers have failed or are not tolerated.
[4] [41] [55][56] Two trials have shown positive benefit with sildenafil in RP. One was a multicenter trial that
studied limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients with significant RP who were nonsmokers, while
the other was a single-site crossover trial in patients with RP.[57] [58] Tadalafil has also shown positive
results in an RP trial in scleroderma and mixed connective tissue disease patients with at least 4 attacks
per week. The medication was effective and also seemed to help digital ulcers, which was a secondary
end point.[59] Similarly, when examining the results of vardenafil compared with placebo in a randomized
crossover trial, there was a reduction in the number of attacks per week, the cumulative duration of
attacks, and RCS in 53 patients with either primary or secondary RP.[60] One PDE-5 inhibitor trial has
shown negative data for RP.[61] Long-acting PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., tadalafil) may be better tolerated than
short-acting PDE-5 inhibitors, causing less hypotension and perhaps better adherence. A 2023 Cochrane
systematic review reported that PDE-5 inhibitors may reduce the frequency and duration of RP attacks;
however, the evidence was of low certainty and little to no difference in pain was reported.[62]

Raynaud phenomenon Management
MANAGEMENT
Prostacyclins (particularly iloprost), sometimes in combination with sildenafil, are used to treat
complications of severe secondary RP, such as threatened digital loss due to ischemia and digital
ulcers.[4] [33] These drugs can be effective for several months after treatment. Treatment with
prostacyclins alone has been shown to decrease the frequency/severity of attacks and heals/prevents
digital ulcers.[41] [63] Intravenous iloprost is generally considered to be the first-line prostacyclin;
however, the intravenous formulation may not be available in some countries, and the inhaled formulation
is generally not recommended for this indication. Therefore, intravenous epoprostenol can be used as an
alternative to intravenous iloprost. Inhaled prostacyclins are not commonly used for RP; however, they
have a role in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension in connective tissue diseases and can improve RP
symptoms. Oral prostacyclins are usually not stable and/or well absorbed and tend to be less effective
than intravenous iloprost.[64] [65]
Atorvastatin has also been found to decrease new ulcer formation in patients with secondary RP and may
be used in patients with past or present ulcers, but is not indicated for the prevention of digital ulcers.[35]
[66]
Bosentan, an endothelial receptor antagonist, has also been used for the prevention of systemic
sclerosis-related digital ulcers.[67] [68] [69] It has been found to reduce the incidence of new ulcers by
30% to 50%.[68] However, it is not superior to usual care in healing current ulcers. It had no effect on
uncomplicated RP in the systemic sclerosis digital ulcer trials.[67] [70][71]
Aspirin may be beneficial in helping prevent microthrombi formation, but there are no trials with aspirin in
RP.[72]
Wound care of digital ulcers should also be considered.[35] Topical antibacterials can be used if there is
no evidence of a significant infection, but they may be working as a barrier and lubricant more than an
antibacterial.
Antibiotics should be given when ulcers are infected. Infections are often due to  Staphylococcus aureus 
or  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but can also be caused by  Escherichia coli ,  Enterococcus faecalis , 
Streptococcus epidermidis , or  Bacillus morganii .[73] If there is frank purulence, it is advisable to take
a swab for culture and sensitivities prior to starting antibiotics, and to tailor treatment based on swab
sensitivities and severity of infection. Examples of antibiotic options may include cloxacillin, cephalexin,
or erythromycin. However, you should consult your local protocols for guidance. If infection is not
resolved after 7 days of treatment (e.g., continued discolored purulence), treat for another 3 to 7 days. If
osteomyelitis is suspected, seek specialist advice from a microbiologist. See Osteomyelitis .
Pain relief is an important component of symptom management. Vasodilators treat the pain of RP if they
are effective in reducing the frequency, severity, or duration of attacks. However, analgesics may be
required to treat pain from severe or prolonged ischemia or complications such as gangrene or digital
ulcers. Local pain management algorithms should be followed, and treatment should be tailored to
medical history and any relative/absolute contraindications. Simple analgesics such as acetaminophen
and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be sufficient. Opioids may be required. Digital
ulcers may be very painful, and opioids such as codeine or oxycodone may be indicated. Rarely,
transdermal fentanyl is used if other opioids are not effective or not tolerated, typically for patients with
gangrene or osteomyelitis.

Surgery
There is limited evidence in support of surgical management of RP. For patients with secondary RP
who have progressed to digital ulceration or gangrene, however, surgery may be indicated.[4] For some
digital ulcers, debridement by a surgeon may be necessary to remove necrotic tissue and/or infection
and promote healing. If gangrene has progressed in spite of treatment, amputation of the digit may be
required.
Surgical sympathectomy may be effective in the treatment of severe RP that has failed pharmacologic
treatment.[6] [35] Techniques available include stellate ganglion or lumbar sympathetic blocks,
proximal cervical sympathectomies via endoscopic surgery, and selective palmar and/or digital
sympathectomies.[74] Such techniques may not be available in all centers. A 2022 study reported pain
relief with prevention of major amputation in 68 children with rheumatologic disorders presenting with RP
after sympathetic blocks (including stellate ganglion blocks).[75] In one retrospective study of 17 patients
with systemic sclerosis, localized palmar or digital sympathectomy improved pain and ulcer healing.[76]
Complementary and alternative therapies
Several alternative therapies or supplements have been claimed to help improve RP; however, these
lack sufficient evidence and rely on patient testimonials. Complementary and alternative therapies that
have been investigated in randomized controlled trials include evening primrose oil, omega-3 fatty acids, 
Ginkgo biloba , biofeedback, acupuncture, and low-level laser therapy.[77] [78] [79] [80] [81][82] A review
and meta-analysis of complementary and alternative medicines in the treatment of RP found most trials
were negative, of poor quality, and done prior to 1990.[83] However, given the limited risks associated with
these treatments, using them as an adjunctive therapy may be considered for patients at any stage of RP
severity, but patients should be informed on their lack of shown efficacy.
One study involving patients with RP who were deficient in vitamin D showed improvements on the visual
analog scale with use of oral vitamin D3 supplementation compared with placebo supplementation.[84]
The effects of ceramic or silver-lined gloves in RP have also been investigated. One study reported
improvement in pain and dexterity in patients using ceramic-lined gloves for 3 months compared with
cotton gloves, whereas a 2022 study investigating silver-lined gloves found no improvement compared
with normal gloves.[85] [86]

have failed or are not tolerated.[4][41] [55]
[56] Trials have shown a positive benefit with
sildenafil in RP.[57] [58] Longer-acting PDE-5
inhibitors such as tadalafil are also used.
Although dosing for tadalafil is more convenient,
it has shown positive findings in RP only in a
small crossover study, but not in combination
with prostacyclins.[59] A trial of vardenafil
versus placebo in RP has shown that vardenafil
is associated with a reduction in frequency
and duration of RP attacks and Raynaud's
Condition Score (RCS).[60] A 2023 Cochrane
systematic review reported that PDE-5 inhibitors
may reduce the frequency and duration of RP
attacks.[62]
» A prostacyclin would not normally be combined
with a PDE-5 inhibitor due to the potential for
drug interactions. Also, combining a prostacyclin
and PDE-5 inhibitor can cause significant
hypotension. However, if RP is sufficently
severe to warrant prostanoid treatment, the
patient would likely be referred to an expert
center where a combination treatment may be
considered.

» Can be used to help prevent formation of
systemic sclerosis-related digital ulcers.[67] [68]
[69] It has been found to reduce the incidence of
new ulcers by 30% to 50%.[68] However, it is not
superior to usual care in healing current ulcers.
» Liver function tests need to be checked
monthly during treatment, and the duration of

is unknown but may be indefinitely.[67] [70][71]
 This use is off-label in the US.
2nd surgical sympathectomy
» Surgical sympathectomy may be effective
in the treatment of severe RP that has
failed pharmacologic treatment.[6] [35]
 Techniques available include stellate ganglion
or lumbar sympathetic blocks, proximal
cervical sympathectomies via endoscopic
surgery, and selective palmar and/or digital
sympathectomies.[74] Such techniques may
not be available in all centers. A 2022 study
reported pain relief with prevention of major
amputation in 68 children with rheumatologic
disorders presenting with RP after sympathetic
blocks (including stellate ganglion blocks).[75]
 In one retrospective study of 17 patients
with systemic sclerosis, localized palmar or
digital sympathectomy improved pain and ulcer
healing.[76]
plus lifestyle measures
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Lifestyle measures should also be considered
alongside treatment in people with secondary
RP who have progressed to digital ulceration.
These include keeping warm and avoiding damp:
for instance, by wearing gloves or using hand
warmers. Patients should be advised to quit
smoking and avoid drugs known to exacerbate
RP (e.g., beta-blockers, ergotamine, clonidine,
cyclosporine, caffeine, cocaine, amphetamines).
Avoiding injury to digits and exposure to
vibration, as well as minimizing stress, are
also recommended. Vasoconstrictor drugs
should be discontinued where possible.[4] [31]
 Patients should also be advised to moisturize
the skin around ulcers, avoid contact with
cleaning agents, avoid manipulation of ulcers,
wear protective gloves, and promote circulation

» Pain relief is an important component of
symptom management. Vasodilators treat the
pain of RP if they are effective in reducing
the frequency, severity, or duration of attacks.
However, analgesics may be required to treat
pain from severe or prolonged ischemia or
complications such as gangrene or digital ulcers.
» Local pain management algorithms should
be followed, and treatment should be tailored
to medical history and any relative/absolute
contraindications. Simple analgesics such
as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be sufficient.
Short- or long-acting opioids may be required.
Digital ulcers may be very painful, and codeine
or oxycodone may be indicated. Rarely,
transdermal fentanyl is used if other opioids
are not effective or not tolerated, typically for
patients with gangrene or osteomyelitis. Local
palmar and/or digital sympathectomy is a last-

» If there is a large fingertip ulcer, debridement
by a surgeon may be necessary to remove
necrotic tissue and/or infection and to promote
healing.[4] If gangrene has progressed in spite
of treatment, amputation of the digit may be
required.
adjunct systemic antibiotics
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in

Primary options
» cephalexin: 500 mg orally four times daily
Secondary options
» erythromycin base: 250-500 mg orally four

are infected. Infections are often due to 
Staphylococcus aureus  or  Pseudomonas
aeruginosa , but can also be caused by 
Escherichia coli ,  Enterococcus faecalis , 
Streptococcus epidermidis , or  Bacillus morganii
.[73] If there is frank purulence, it is advisable
to take a swab for culture and sensitivities prior
to starting antibiotics, and to tailor treatment
based on swab sensitivities and severity of
infection. Examples of antibiotic options may
include cloxacillin, cephalexin, or erythromycin.
However, you should consult your local protocols
for guidance. 
» If infection is not resolved after 7 days of
treatment (e.g., continued discolored purulence),
treat for another 3 to 7 days.
» If osteomyelitis is suspected, seek specialist
advice from a microbiologist. See Osteomyelitis .

1st lifestyle measures
» Many patients with RP do not require treatment
unless symptoms become severe.
» Nonpharmacologic interventions should be
considered first in primary or mild secondary
RP and mainly include preventative measures
and avoidance of triggers. These include
keeping warm and avoiding damp: for instance,
by wearing gloves or using hand warmers.
Advice should be given about quitting smoking,
moisturizing dry skin, and avoiding drugs
known to exacerbate RP (e.g., beta-blockers,

» Nondihydropyridine classes of calcium-channel
blockers (e.g., diltiazem) can be offered if
dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers cannot
be used or are ineffective.[4] [36][39]
» Calcium-channel blockers may not be effective
in all patients and may have adverse effects
such as hypotension, lightheadedness, flushing,
and ankle puffiness. Short-acting calcium-
channel blockers may cause orthostatic
hypotension, and many people with RP are
young and have normal-to-low blood pressure.
If the short-acting calcium-channel blocker is
tolerated but not effective, then the dose can be
increased.[4]

Raynaud phenomenon Management
Emerging
OnabotulinumtoxinA
There are no large randomized controlled trials. One small trial assessed the efficacy of local injections
of onabotulinumtoxinA (botulinum toxin type A) versus placebo in improving blood flow to the hands of
patients with RP secondary to scleroderma. It found some short-term benefit though it questioned its clinical
meaningfulness, and blood flow was not significantly different at 4 months.[87] A 2023 systematic review and
meta-analysis identified 13 studies investigating the use of onabotulinumtoxinA (botulinum toxin type A) for
treating RP. The findings indicated a reduction in both pain and impairment.[88] However, further randomized
controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required.
Primary prevention
A healthy lifestyle, such as avoiding smoking, avoiding injury to digits and vibration exposure, regularly
exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding high doses of thyroid hormone replacement therapy, as
well as avoiding prolonged exposure to cold temperatures (e.g., by wearing proper outdoor clothing) may
reduce the onset of RP in at-risk individuals, but prospective studies in this area are lacking. At-risk people
may include those with a strong family history of RP and/or systemic sclerosis.
Secondary prevention
Secondary prevention in patients with RP focuses on reducing attacks through implementing lifestyle
measures. The risk of attacks can be mitigated by avoiding smoking, avoiding injury to digits and vibration
exposure, regularly exercising, moisturizing dry skin, avoiding drugs known to exacerbate RP, and keeping
warm and avoiding damp.[31]
Keeping warm will depend on where a person is living and working. Mild evenings and even air conditioning
can trigger RP. Measures to keep the head, hands, and feet warm and dry are especially recommended,
as these are more sensitive to temperature changes. Examples can include having adequate blankets
while sleeping, wearing waterproof clothing, wearing heated gloves or socks, having a local heater in the
workplace, heating a vehicle with a remote starter and/or using a steering wheel cover, and wearing mittens
in grocery stores.
Patient discussions
Advice to mitigate RP attacks should include:
• Staying warm and avoiding damp (e.g., having adequate blankets while sleeping, wearing
waterproof clothing, using heated gloves or socks, having a local heater in the workplace, heating a
vehicle with a remote starter and/or using a steering wheel cover, wearing mittens in grocery stores)
• Moisturizing dry skin
• Quitting smoking
• Avoiding injury to digits and vibration exposure
• Avoiding stress
• Doing regular exercise, although there is no evidence to suggest that this improves RP.
Many pharmacologic treatments for RP cause lightheadedness, flushing, or more rarely peripheral edema
(puffy feet) and palpitations. Medical attention should be sought if adverse effects are severe.

Monitoring
RP should be monitored by regular symptom review and physical exam. If underlying connective tissue
disease is suspected, capillary microscopy at the nailbeds should be arranged. Patients with abnormally
dilated capillaries are at increased risk of developing a connective tissue disease (especially scleroderma)
over the following 3 to 5 years.[28]

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
necrosis with gangrene long term medium
Necrosis may occur in secondary RP but not in primary RP. This complication results from the progression
of digital ulcers and ischemia and may lead to autoamputation or require surgical amputation. In digital
ulcers with scleroderma, only 60% of ulcers heal by 6 months, with 1% to 2% requiring amputation.[71]
[91]
autoamputation long term low
May result from severe digital ischemia and tissue necrosis.
ischemic digital ulcers variable medium
The likelihood of developing digital ulcers increases with disease duration, probably due to worsening
obliterative vasculopathy. The presence of digital ulceration is generally thought to exclude a diagnosis
of primary RP, so a secondary cause should be sought if ulceration occurs. Ischemic digital ulcers are
found on the digit tips. Treatment of digital ulcers includes prostacyclins and phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5)
inhibitors.[58] [64] Bosentan may be used for prevention of digital ulcers.[68]
traumatic digital ulcers variable medium
Traumatic ulcers (particularly in scleroderma) are often located on the extensor surfaces of the fingers.
Creased areas with little underlying subcutaneous tissue (such as the extensor surfaces of the proximal
interphalangeal joints) are particularly vulnerable.
Treating traumatic ulcers with vasodilator therapy is not appropriate. Treatment should be targeted at
protecting the digits from further trauma and treating superimposed infection as it arises; analgesia is often
required.
digital tuft resorption variable medium
Moderate risk in secondary RP; does not occur in primary RP. Ischemia causes loss of tissue pulp and
should be treated with prostacyclins and PDE-5 inhibitors.
threatened ischemic digit variable medium
Patients with severe ischemia should be treated with intravenous prostacyclins such as iloprost or
epoprostenol, and sildenafil or other PDE-5 inhibitors such as tadalafil and vardenafil. If necessary a
sympathetic block should be considered. Techniques available include stellate ganglion blockage, proximal
cervical sympathectomies via endoscopic surgery, and local palmar and/or digital sympathectomies. Such
techniques may not be available in all centers.
digital pits variable medium
Fibrotic plugs due to ischemia occur in RP and should be treated with prostacyclins and PDE-5 inhibitors.

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
cellulitis/osteomyelitis variable medium
Digital ulcers can become infected and may require topical or oral antibiotics and appropriate wound care.
If osteomyelitis is suspected, seek specialist advice from a microbiologist.
Prognosis
Prognosis
The course may fluctuate in both primary and secondary RP. Symptoms worsen in cold weather and during
seasonal changes with the absolute daily change in temperature and on cold, wet days. Not keeping warm
and trauma to the affected areas may precipitate attacks. Attacks may last from several minutes to a few
hours. Many people with primary RP report that their symptoms become more mild or even disappear over
time. Approximately 13% of patients later develop an underlying disorder such as scleroderma.[90]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
