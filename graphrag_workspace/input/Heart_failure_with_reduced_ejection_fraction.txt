Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Overview
Summary
Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac
disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood.
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%
or less.
Heart failure with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) is HF with LVEF 41% to 49%.
HF is a major and growing public health problem. It is the only cardiovascular disease that is increasing
in incidence and prevalence, partly because the population is aging, but also because of improved
cardiovascular interventions for disease processes that reduce early mortality but may result in cardiac
changes that lead to heart failure.
The key manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance, and fluid retention,
which may lead to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema.
The single most useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients is the comprehensive 2-dimensional
echocardiogram coupled with Doppler flow studies. Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide can be useful
in the evaluation of patients at initial presentation.
Interventions that have a proven beneficial impact on patient survival include angiotensin receptor-neprilysin
inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists,
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, hydralazine and nitrates, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.
Comorbidity is common, with most HF patients having at least one comorbid condition such as obesity or
coronary artery disease.
Definition
Heart failure (HF) is a condition in which the heart is unable to generate a cardiac output sufficient to meet
the demands of the body without increasing diastolic pressure. It can result from any cardiac disease that
compromises ventricular systolic or diastolic function or both. A universal definition of HF, proposed in 2021
by the Heart Failure Society of America, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology,
and the Japanese Heart Failure Society, describes HF as "a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs
caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality and corroborated by elevated natriuretic peptide
levels and/or objective evidence of pulmonary or systemic congestion."[1]
In clinical practice, the term "congestive heart failure" is usually used for patients with breathlessness and
abnormal sodium and water retention, resulting in edema. However, the term "congestive" has been removed
from the universal definition, as a reminder that there is a wide range of symptoms and signs once the
patient is diagnosed with HF.[1]
HF comprises a wide range of clinical scenarios, from patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF ≥50%) to those with reduced myocardial contractility (LVEF <40%).
Based on LVEF, the universal definition classifies HF as follows:[1]
1. HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): HF with LVEF ≤40%.

OVERVIEW
2. HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF): HF with LVEF 41% to 49%.
3. HF with preserved EF (HFpEF): HF with LVEF ≥50%; for more information on this, see Heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction .
4. HF with improved EF (HFimpEF): HF with a baseline LVEF of ≤40%, a ≥10-point increase from baseline
LVEF, and a second measurement of LVEF of >40%.
Advanced HF is defined as having severe symptoms and/or signs of HF at rest, recurrent hospitalizations
despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), being refractory or intolerant to GDMT, and requiring
advanced therapies such as consideration for transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, or palliative
care.[1]

Epidemiology
The prevalence of known heart failure (HF) in high-income countries has been estimated at 1% to 3%,
and the incidence is estimated at 1 to 20 per 1000 person-years, depending on study population.[2] [3] [4]
 The CaReMe study, which uses data from healthcare registries in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK, reported the prevalence of HF in the adult
population to be 1% to 2%, depending on whether a broad or strict definition was used.[5] Of those with a
recorded ejection fraction (EF), about 39% had HF with reduced EF and 18% had HF with mildly reduced
EF.[5]
In the US, among people ages 40-59 years, the prevalence of HF is about 2.3% in men and 1.2% in women,
and in people ages ≥80 years, the prevalence of HF is about 7.1% in men and 10.9% in women.[6] Estimates
based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2017 to 2020 suggest that
around 6.7 million adults ages ≥20 years had HF in the US.[6] Prevalence is increasing in the US, and is
projected to rise from 2.4% of the total US population in 2012 to 3.0% in 2030.[6]
Worldwide the absolute numbers of people living with HF are also increasing.[2] The rising prevalence of
HF is not necessarily linked with an increase in HF incidence, as the incidence appears to be stable or
decreasing in some countries, in part due to better treatment and reduced mortality of patients with acute
myocardial infarctions earlier in life.[2] [3] HF is primarily a condition of older people, and thus the widely
recognized "aging of the population" contributes to its increasing prevalence.[2]
Comorbidity and multimorbidity is common in patients with HF.[7] One study looking at 12 common
comorbidities (coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, hypertension, peripheral artery disease,
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis,
COPD, and chronic kidney disease) found that 98% to 99% of HF patients had at least one comorbidity, and
those with HFrEF had a mean of 3.7 comorbidities.[8] Comorbidity burden increases with age; in patients
ages <40 years, none had more than four comorbidities, but more than four comorbidities were present in
39% to 40% of those ages ≥80 years.[8]
Etiology
There are numerous and varied causes of HF.[7] [9]
Common causes of chronic HF include:
• Coronary artery disease/ischemic heart disease
• Hypertension
• Valvular disease
• Myocarditis.
Other causes include:
• Infiltrative diseases: amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoid
• Congenital heart diseases
• Pericardial disease
• Toxin-induced: heroin, alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, lead, arsenic, cobalt, phosphorus
• Infection: bacterial, fungal, viral (HIV),  Borrelia burgdorferi  (Lyme disease), parasite (e.g., 
Trypanosoma cruzi  [Chagas disease])

THEORY
• Endocrine disorders: diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia,
pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, growth hormone deficiency
• Systemic collagen vascular diseases: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis
nodosa, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Takayasu syndrome, polymyositis, reactive arthritis
• Chemotherapy-induced: e.g., adriamycin/anthracyclines, trastuzumab
• Nutritional deficiencies: e.g., thiamine, protein, selenium, L-carnitine
• Pregnancy: peripartum cardiomyopathy
• Familial cardiomyopathy
• Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
• Stress cardiomyopathy
• Radiation therapy
• Carcinoid heart disease.
Although Chagas disease is an uncommon cause of congestive HF in Europe and North America, it is an
important cause of HF in Central and South America.[2] [7]
Some of these conditions tend to increase metabolic demand, which may not be matched by a sufficient
increase in cardiac output by the failing heart. Tachyarrhythmias also decrease the diastolic ventricular filling
time and increase myocardial oxygen demand. Uncontrolled hypertension depresses systolic function by
increasing the afterload against which the failing ventricle must pump blood, and may be the first clinical
manifestation.
It should be emphasized that many of these causes may be completely reversible given appropriate and
timely treatment/intervention (e.g., revascularization for stunned or hibernating myocardium; standard
therapy for peripartum or hypertensive cardiomyopathy; valvuloplasty or valve replacement for valvular heart
disease; standard treatment and adjunctive rate control therapy for tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
and cardiomyopathy related to sepsis and stress).[7] [10] [11] Other causes, such as scarred myocardium or
infiltrative cardiomyopathy, are currently considered irreversible.
Pathophysiology
The understanding of the pathophysiology of HF has evolved significantly over the last decades, from the
hemodynamic model to the neurohormonal paradigm.[12] HF represents a complex syndrome in which
an initial myocardial insult results in the overexpression of multiple peptides with different short- and long-
term effects on the cardiovascular system. Neurohormonal activation is recognized to play a pivotal role
in the development as well as the progression of HF. In the acute phase, neurohormonal activation seems
to be beneficial in terms of maintaining adequate cardiac output and peripheral perfusion. Sustained
neurohormonal activation, however, eventually results in increased wall stress, dilation, and ventricular
remodeling, which contribute to disease progression in the failing myocardium, which eventually leads
to further neurohormonal activation. Left ventricular remodeling is the process by which mechanical,
neurohormonal, and possibly genetic factors alter ventricular size, shape, and function. Remodeling occurs
in several clinical conditions, including myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and valvular
heart disease; its hallmarks include hypertrophy, loss of myocytes, and increased interstitial fibrosis. One
potential deleterious outcome of remodeling, as the left ventricle dilates and the heart assumes a more
globular shape, is the development of mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation results in an increasing volume
overload on the overburdened left ventricle that further contributes to remodeling and progression of disease
and symptoms.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Theory
Classification
Universal definition and classification of heart failure:
classifications of HF according to ejection fraction[1]
• HF with reduced EF (HFrEF): HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%.
• HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF): HF with LVEF 41% to 49%.
• HF with preserved EF (HFpEF): HF with LVEF ≥50%.
• HF with improved EF (HFimpEF): HF with a baseline LVEF of ≤40%, a ≥10-point increase from
baseline LVEF, and a second measurement of LVEF of >40%.
Case history
Case history #1
A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of increasing shortness
of breath, especially when trying to sleep. She has a history of poorly controlled hypertension and
hyperlipidemia, and is being treated with a beta-blocker and statin therapy. She does not smoke and she
drinks alcohol in moderation. On examination, her blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg and heart rate is 126
beats per minute. There is an audible S4 and the jugular venous pressure is elevated 3 cm above normal.
There is no edema, but she has fine bilateral mid to lower zone crepitation on lung examination. The ECG
shows left ventricular hypertrophy, and a transthoracic echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy,
left atrial dilation, and normal right ventricular systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of
40% and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
Case history #2
A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department. He reports being progressively short of breath.
He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has been a heavy smoker for more than
40 years. He underwent a successful primary angioplasty for a large acute anterior myocardial infarction 2
months ago. His blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, his heart rate 110 beats per minute, and his respiratory
rate 30. He has elevated neck veins and a prominent S3. His ECG shows sinus tachycardia, and a
transthoracic echocardiogram performed in the emergency department reveals impaired left ventricular
systolic function, with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Other presentations
Many patients remain asymptomatic for an extended period of time because mild impairment in cardiac
function is balanced by compensatory mechanisms.
Precipitating factors and comorbidity
Often, clinical manifestations occur only in the presence of precipitating factors that increase the cardiac
workload and tip the balanced state into one of decompensation. Thus, the first symptoms and signs
may be those of the underlying precipitating condition, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation, anemia, fever,
infection, hyperthyroidism, or even pregnancy. A large pulmonary embolism can also lead to the first
presentation of symptoms, or to exacerbation of known chronic HF, by causing hypoxemia, decreased
myocardial oxygen supply, and increased right ventricular afterload. An acute ischemic insult (i.e., an

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Diagnosis
Approach
A universal definition of heart failure (HF), proposed in 2021 by the Heart Failure Society of America, the
Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Japanese Heart Failure Society,
describes HF as "a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/or functional
cardiac abnormality and corroborated by elevated natriuretic peptide levels and/or objective evidence of
pulmonary or systemic congestion."[1] Identification of the condition responsible for the cardiac structural
and/or functional abnormalities may be important, because some conditions that lead to left ventricular
dysfunction are potentially treatable and/or reversible.[7]
Precipitating factors and comorbidity
Efforts to identify a cause frequently allow the detection of coexistent conditions that may contribute to or
exacerbate the severity of symptoms. However, it may not be possible to discern the cause of HF in many
patients presenting with this syndrome, and in others, the underlying condition may not be amenable to
treatment.
A number of precipitating factors may lead to impaired cardiac function, potentially leading to an
episode of acute HF. Detection and treatment of precipitating factors plays an important role in patient
management. Precipitating factors include excessive salt intake, lack of adherence to medication and
diet, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, valvular
disease, cardiotoxic chemotherapy, infection, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, renal dysfunction, and
alcohol and drug abuse.[9]
The most common comorbid chronic conditions are hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and
hyperlipidemia.[7] [9]

DIAGNOSIS
Patient history
HF is primarily a condition of older people.[2] [14] The complexity and variety of potential causative
factors means that a multitude of patient historic factors may be relevant. Comorbidity is common with
98% to 99% HF patients having at least one comorbid condition (average 3 to 4 comorbidities).[8] A
history of hypertension; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; tobacco use; coronary, valvular, or peripheral
vascular disease; rheumatic fever; heart murmur or congenital heart disease; personal or family history
of myopathy; mediastinal irradiation; and sleep-disturbed breathing should be enquired about. The drug
history should record the past or current use of illicit drugs, alcohol, ephedra, or antineoplastic agents
such as anthracyclines, trastuzumab, or high-dose cyclophosphamide, because HF may occur years
after exposure to these chemotherapy agents. The history and physical evaluation should include specific
consideration of noncardiac diseases such as collagen vascular disease, bacterial or parasitic infection,
obesity, thyroid excess or deficiency, amyloidosis, carcinoid, and pheochromocytoma.
A detailed family history should be obtained, not only to determine whether there is a familial
predisposition to atherosclerotic disease but also to identify relatives with cardiomyopathy, sudden
unexplained death, conduction system disease, and skeletal myopathies.
Dyspnea on exertion or at rest is the most common symptom of left-sided HF. With increasing failure, the
patient may develop leg edema, weight gain, and abdominal distension due to ascites.[101] Patients with
primarily right-sided HF may present with fatigue, leg edema, weight gain, and rarely with abdominal pain
due to liver congestion. In late stages they may have abdominal distension due to ascites.
Physical exam
Particular attention should be paid to the cardinal signs of HF. Their presence (and degree) may depend
on severity of HF and associated comorbid disease.
General examination may reveal tachycardia and cyanosis. A focused cardiovascular examination may
reveal elevated jugular venous pressure, ankle edema, and a displaced apex beat, which suggests
cardiomegaly. On auscultation, besides presence of pulmonary rales or crepitation, an S3 gallop may be
present, which has prognostic significance.
Precipitating factors and comorbidity
Clinical manifestations of the underlying etiology of HF may be present, for example:
• macroglossia and neuropathy (which may point to infiltrative cardiomyopathy such as amyloidosis)
• pallor (which may reflect anemia)
• irregularly irregular pulse (reflecting atrial fibrillation)
• systolic murmur of aortic stenosis and mid-diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis
• overt signs of thyrotoxicosis.
In patients on dialysis, a large arteriovenous fistula may occasionally be the precipitating factor. However,
further discussion of the clinical features of all the etiologic conditions is beyond the scope of this topic.
Initial investigations
For all patients, initial investigations should include ECG, chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiogram, and
baseline hematology and blood chemistry, including complete blood count, urinalysis, serum electrolytes
(including calcium and magnesium), blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, liver function tests, B-type

natriuretic peptide/N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, thyroid function, blood glucose, and
lipids.[7] [9]
• Anemia and high lymphocyte percentage are strong risk factors and prognostic markers of poor
survival
• In patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of natriuretic peptide biomarkers is useful
to support a diagnosis or exclude HF. However, elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides
can occur with a wide variety of cardiac and noncardiac causes; therefore, clinical judgment is
necessary.
Measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), usually by echocardiogram, is required for
classification of HF:[1]
• HF with reduced EF (HFrEF): HF with LVEF ≤40%
• HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF): HF with LVEF 41% to 49%
• HF with preserved EF (HFpEF): HF with LVEF ≥50%
• HF with improved EF (HFimpEF): HF with a baseline LVEF of ≤40%, a ≥10-point increase from
baseline LVEF, and a second measurement of LVEF of >40%
Initial investigations for common comorbidities: blood glucose, thyroid function tests, and blood lipids are
useful to assess for commonly associated comorbid disease. ECG may show evidence of underlying
coronary artery disease (CAD). Transthoracic echo can identify valvular, myocardial, or pericardial
disease or may reveal evidence of underlying CAD (regional wall motion/thickness abnormalities). A
hypertrophied heart may be due to hypertension, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative
disease such as amyloidosis.
Subsequent investigations
Investigations that help in assessing severity of HF and functional status include noninvasive stress
imaging (cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], stress echocardiogram, single photon
emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron emission tomography [PET]), standard exercise stress
testing (bicycle or treadmill), coronary angiogram, cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography,
cardiopulmonary exercise testing with VO₂ max, 6-minute walking test exercise, and left and right heart
catheterization. Troponin measurement is helpful in further risk stratification in chronic HF, as an elevated
level is associated with progressive left ventricular dysfunction and increased mortality.[102] Soluble ST2
and galectin-3 (biomarkers for myocardial fibrosis) are predictive of death and hospitalization in patients
with HF and are additive to natriuretic peptide in their prognostic value.[103]
Subsequent investigations for comorbidities: based on clinical history, HIV screening and measurement
of iron levels and fasting transferrin saturation to screen for hemochromatosis may also be performed. A
cardiac MRI scan is particularly useful in the investigation of myocarditis and infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
Multi-slice CT (MSCT) can be used for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation. There appears
to be no significant difference in LVEF estimation between MSCT and MRI, and also between MSCT
and transthoracic echocardiogram.[104] MSCT may offer additional benefit as it provides a combined
evaluation of LVEF and coronary artery disease. Endomyocardial biopsy is ordered if acute myocarditis
(giant cell or eosinophilic) or primary infiltrative diseases of the heart (amyloidosis, active cardiac
sarcoidosis) is suspected. 
Other investigations for comorbidities and causes
Following history, physical exam and initial investigations, any suspected comorbidities should be further
investigated. See separate topics for details.

DIAGNOSIS
• Established atrial fibrillation (Diagnostic approach)
• Iron-deficiency anemia (Diagnostic approach)
• Essential hypertension (Diagnostic approach)
• Obstructive sleep apnea in adults (Diagnostic approach)
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults (Diagnostic approach)
• Chronic coronary disease (Diagnostic approach)
• Hypercholesterolemia (Diagnostic approach)
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
dyspnea (common)
• The most common symptom of left-sided HF. May occur with exertion (New York Heart Association
[NYHA] II-III) or, in more severe cases, at rest (NYHA IV). This is considered a minor criterion for the
diagnosis of HF (Framingham criteria).
neck vein distension (common)
• A major Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF.
S3 gallop (common)
• A major Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF.
•
cardiomegaly (common)
• Cardiomegaly is a major Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF. Left ventricular dilation or
hypertrophy are common findings.
hepatojugular reflux (common)
• A major Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF.
rales (common)
• A major Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF.
orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (uncommon)
• Orthopnea (dyspnea that develops in the recumbent position) usually worsens immediately after lying
down, because of a sudden increase in venous return; that is, preload. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
occurs several hours after the patient lies down to sleep; it results from the central redistribution of
extravascular fluid that progressively increases the venous return.
nocturia (uncommon)
• Increased frequency of uresis occurs several hours after the patient lies down to sleep; it also results
from the central redistribution of extravascular fluid that augments the amount of circulating blood
cleared from the kidneys.

Other diagnostic factors
tachycardia (heart rate >120 beats per minute) (common)
• A minor Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF.
chest discomfort (common)
• A symptom of poor coronary perfusion.
hepatomegaly (common)
• A minor Framingham criterion for the diagnosis of HF; may cause abdominal discomfort/distension and

fatigue, muscle weakness, or tiredness (common)
• Symptom of poor tissue (muscle) perfusion.
palpitations, presyncope, or syncope (uncommon)
• This may be the result of frequent ectopic supraventricular or ventricular beats or may reflect

valvular disease, e.g., aortic stenosis.
lethargy/confusion (uncommon)
• Symptom of poor tissue (brain) perfusion.
Risk factors
Strong
coronary artery disease (CAD)
• CAD is one of the most common comorbidities and causes of HF.[13] [14] [15] [16] It has a key role in
the development and progression of HF and all patients should be assessed for coronary disease as a
possible cause of HF and to guide management.[7][9]
myocardial infarction (MI)
• The link between MI and the risk of HF development is strongly and consistently supported by the
literature.[13] [14] [15][17] [18] [19] [20] [21][22]

hypertension
• Hypertension is a common comorbidity and cause of HF. Presence of hypertension confers a 2- to 3-
fold increase in risk of developing HF.[13] [14] [17] [18] [19] [20] [23] Elevated systolic blood pressure
(BP), elevated diastolic BP, and elevated pulse pressure have all been associated with increased
risk for HF.[24] [25] Among the Framingham cohort, a 1 standard deviation (20 mmHg) increase in
systolic BP was associated with a 56% increased risk for HF, a 1 standard deviation (10 mmHg)
increase in diastolic BP was associated with 24% increased risk, and a 1 standard deviation (16
mmHg) increase in pulse pressure was associated with a 55% increase in risk.[24] A study in Japan
found that higher nighttime BP and a riser pattern of nocturnal BP (nighttime BP higher than daytime
BP) were significantly associated with the risk of total cardiovascular disease and HF.[26]
diabetes mellitus
• Diabetes mellitus has been associated with a 3- to 5-fold increase in the risk of developing HF and
is a common comorbidity.[14] [17] [18] [20] [27] [28] The highest increase in relative risk is found
among women and people with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.[14] [20] [27] Even a slight
increase of 1% in hemoglobin A1c has been linked to a greater than 10% risk of hospitalization for
HF or death.[29] Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes increase the risk of developing HF across the entire
range of glucose levels; however, HF may be more prevalent in people with type 1 compared with type
2 diabetes.[30]
dyslipidemia
• Lipid abnormalities have been linked to increased risk for HF; they are common comorbidities.[31] [32]
[33] Compared with men with ratios of total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol of less than 5, in one study
men with ratios of 5 to 9.9 had a 1.5-times greater incidence of HF, and men with ratios of greater than
10 had a nearly 5-times greater incidence of HF.[31] In the same study, women with ratios greater
than 10 had more than 6-times greater incidence of HF than women with ratios less than 5.[31] In
one clinical trial of patients with coronary artery disease, lipid lowering was associated with a 21%
reduction in the risk of developing HF.[34]
older age
• Increasing age has been consistently linked to a higher risk of developing HF.[13] [14] [17] [18] [19]
[35] [36] In the Framingham cohort, the incidence of HF increased steadily with increasing age.[14] In
a cohort of people over age 65 years, every 5-year incremental increase in age was associated with a
hazard ratio of 1.37.[18] In another study, the incidence rate of HF among the oldest people (age >80
years) was double that of the youngest people (age 65 to 69 years).[36]
male sex
• Male sex has been consistently linked to a higher risk of developing HF, and HFrEF.[13] [14] [17]
[18] [19] [20] [35] [36] [37] In the Framingham cohort, women had a one third lower incidence of HF
than men and male sex was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.34.[14] [18] [20] In other studies the
incidence among males is 2 to 4 times that of females.[13] [36] In the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) study, which followed a cohort of 13,643 people for an average of 19
years, being male was associated with a relative risk of HF of 1.24.[16]
obesity
• Obesity is a common comorbidity and excess body weight is an established risk factor for the
development of HF.[38] Among a subset of the Framingham cohort, the risk of HF increased by 5%

for men and 7% for women with each increase of 1 in body mass index; obese people (body mass
index 30 or above) had a risk of HF double that of nonobese people.[39] Obesity may result in HF by
inducing hemodynamic and myocardial changes that lead to cardiac dysfunction, or may predispose
to HF risk factors (e.g., hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea) and other cardiovascular disease risk
factors (e.g., diabetes, dyslipidemia).[40]
exposure to cardiotoxic agents
• Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide can cause myocardial damage leading to left ventricular
dysfunction and HF.[41] [42] These chemotherapeutic agents increase risk for HF both during acute
treatment and for several months after treatment has ended, with risk increasing as cumulative dose
increases.[43] [44] In addition, trastuzumab, sunitinib, clofarabine, and carfilzomib have also been
associated with the development of cardiomyopathy.[45] Anthracyclines have also been associated
with an increased risk of congestive HF.[46]
• Mediastinal irradiation can cause direct myocardial damage leading to left ventricular dysfunction and
HF for several years after the treatment has ended.[47]
left ventricular dysfunction
• Moderate-to-severe asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] <40%) has been
associated with a hazard ratio of HF of 7.8, while mild asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (EF
40% to 50%) has been associated with a hazard ratio of 3.3.[48]
left ventricular hypertrophy
• Left ventricular hypertrophy, such as in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, on electrocardiogram
has been associated with a higher risk of HF, with highest relative risk among younger people.[49]
renal insufficiency
• Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity. Renal insufficiency, defined by elevated serum
creatinine (over 1.50 mg/dL in men and 1.30 mg/dL in women) or reduced creatinine clearance (less
than 60 mL/minute), has been linked to increased risk for development of HF. Compared with people
with creatinine of less than 1.10 mg/dL, people with creatinine of 1.30 to 1.49 mg/dL had almost
double the risk of developing congestive HF, those with creatinine of 1.50 to 1.69 mg/dL had almost
triple the risk, and those with creatinine greater than 1.70 mg/dL had almost quadruple the risk.[50]
[51]
valvular heart disease
• Cardiac valvular abnormality was associated with an odds ratio of heart disease of 2.43 among
men and 3.47 among women in a multivariate profile based on the Framingham cohort.[52] Valvular
abnormalities create pressure overload (e.g., aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis) or volume overload
(e.g., mitral regurgitation), which are initially compensated for by mechanisms such as ventricular
hypertrophy or ventricular dilation.[53] Ventricular remodeling alters cardiac contractility and increases
the risk of HF. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation are
important comorbidities of HF. 
sleep apnea
• Sleep-disordered breathing is a common comorbidity and has been linked with an increased risk of HF
in multiple studies.[54] [55] [56] [57] Additionally, a healthy sleep pattern is associated with a lower risk
of HF.[58]

elevated homocysteine
• In the Framingham cohort, elevated plasma homocysteine levels were linked with a roughly three-
quarter increased risk for developing HF.[59]
cocaine use
• Cocaine use has been strongly associated with the development of HF.[60] [61] [62]
family history of HF
• Several polymorphisms have been linked with an increased risk of developing HF. For example, a
deletion of 4 amino acids in position 322 to 325 of the gene coding for a2C-adrenergic receptors
(a2C Del322-325) in sympathetic nerve endings in the heart has been studied as a possible link to
the development of HF. A second polymorphism that was evaluated as a candidate for developing
HF is a change in position 389 of the gene for beta1-adrenergic receptors (b1Arg389) on myocytes.
In the same study, patients who were homozygous for this deletion had a 10-fold increase in risk of
developing HF.[63]
atrial fibrillation
• Often coexists with HF, and the two conditions may cause or exacerbate each other.[9] Atrial fibrillation
increases the risk of thrombo-embolic events (e.g., stroke) and may lead to a worsening of symptoms.
Development of atrial fibrillation in patients with HF is associated with a worse prognosis; however,
those who develop atrial fibrillation first (tachycardiomyopathy) may have a more favorable clinical
course.[9] [64]
thyroid disorders
• Comorbid thyroid disorders, both hyper- or hypothyroidism, are associated with increased risk of HF
and may precipitate hospitalization in acute HF.[7] [9]
anemia
• Anemia is a strong risk factor and prognostic marker of poor survival. A high prevalence of iron
deficiency has been reported in HF.[65] Iron deficiency in HF is due to gastrointestinal or genitourinary
blood loss related to the use of antiplatelet drugs and/or oral anticoagulation, impaired nutrition,
malabsorption, and reduced intracellular uptake of iron.[66] [67]
elevated tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-alfa) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)
• TNF-alfa is a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated with myocyte death and cardiac dysfunction.[68]
IL-6 is a similar pro-inflammatory cytokine.[69]
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)
• Among the Framingham cohort, an increase of 5 mg/dL in CRP level was associated with over a 2-fold
increase in risk of HF.[69] People who also had elevated serum IL-6 and TNF-alfa values had a 4-fold
increase in risk of HF.[69]
decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
• IGF-1 has been shown to have positive inotropic effects and to decrease the rate of cellular
apoptosis.[70] [71] IGF-1 has also been tentatively linked to vasodilation, which may improve cardiac
emptying.[72] Among the Framingham cohort, patients with a serum IGF-1 level below 140 mg/L had
double the risk of developing HF.[73]

elevated natriuretic peptides
• In the Framingham cohort, increased levels of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminus
of the atrial natriuretic peptide prohormone (N-ANP) were associated with an increased risk of HF.
BNP levels above the 80th percentile (20.0 picograms/mL for men and 23.3 picograms/mL for women)
were associated with a 3-fold increase in HF risk.[74]
dilation of the left ventricle
• The risk-factor-adjusted hazard ratio for HF in an asymptomatic population was 1.47 per 1 standard
deviation increase in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and 1.43 per 1 standard deviation increase
in left ventricular end-systolic dimension.[48]
increased left ventricular mass
• In one cohort, those who developed HF had an initial average left ventricular mass/height of 106 g/m,
versus 88 g/m among those who did not develop HF.[48] [75] [76]
abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling
• Alternations in the E to A wave ratio, both low and high, have been associated with HF risk, with those
with the lowest E to A wave ratio (<0.7) having a relative risk of 1.88 and those with the highest E to A
wave ratio (>1.5) having a relative risk of 3.50.[48] [76]
metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome
• Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of common conditions, including insulin resistance, impaired
glucose tolerance, abdominal obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, elevated
triglycerides, and hypertension. Metabolic syndrome and the individual components are risk factors for
development and progression of HF.[77] CKM syndrome is a disorder defined by the American Heart
Association (AHA) to reflect the connections between metabolic disease (obesity, diabetes, metabolic
syndrome), kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD).[78] [79] It includes both individuals
at risk for CVD (due to the presence of metabolic risk factors, CKD, or both) and individuals with
existing CVD. Poor CKM health affects nearly all organ systems and is associated with cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality. The AHA has proposed a CKM syndrome staging system based on patient
risk factors and opportunities for prevention and care. The AHA recommends that these patients are
managed by an interdisciplinary team with targeted referral of high-risk CKM patients to appropriate
subspecialists.[78]
Weak
low socioeconomic status
• The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) study found that low
socioeconomic status (as indicated by less than high school education) was associated with a relative
risk of HF of 1.22 (population attributable risk 8.9%).[16]
tobacco consumption
• Current and past cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of HF independently of other
risk factors.[80] [81] [82] Smoking cessation has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of HF;
however, the excess HF risk may persist for a few decades.[81]

alcohol misuse
• Chronic excess alcohol consumption is a risk factor for development of HF.[83] [84] [85] [86] [87]
 This may be related to both direct myocardial toxicity of alcohol and the higher risk of hypertension
development. The effect of moderate alcohol consumption on the risk of HF is uncertain, as studies
have not demonstrated a causal relationship.
excess sodium intake
• The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found the relative risk for a 100-
mmols/day increase in sodium intake was 1.26.[88]
tachycardia
• Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy has been well described in the literature. Among the
Framingham cohort, an increase in heart rate of 10 beats per minute was linked with a greater than
10% increased risk of developing HF.[52]
depression/stress
• Risk of HF is double among depressed compared with nondepressed older people.[89] [90] While
depression is associated with an increased risk of HF, patients with HF may also be at increased risk
of depression.[91] In people ages <65 years with HF, 36.2% have comorbid depression.[7]
microalbuminuria
• Although no link between microalbuminuria and the development of HF has been established,
microalbuminuria was linked with a 3-fold increased risk of HF hospitalization in the Heart Outcomes
Prevention Evaluation study.[92]
aspirin use
• In an individual patient data pooled analysis of six observational studies, aspirin use was associated
with an increased risk of HF in people over 40 years old (mean age 67 years) with at least one of
the following predisposing factors for HF: smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease.[93]
micronutrient deficiency
• Deficiency of micronutrients, such as selenium, zinc, and copper, has been linked to the development
of cardiomyopathy.[94]

• Allows for the accurate determination of biventricular systolic

myocardial, or pericardial disease or may reveal evidence of
underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) (regional wall motion/
thickness abnormalities). A hypertrophied heart may be due to
hypertension, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative
disease such as amyloidosis. It should be performed in every patient
presenting with HF symptoms.

abnormal
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels
• Elevated plasma BNP levels have been associated with reduced
left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy,
elevated left ventricular filling pressures, and acute myocardial
infarction and ischemia, although they can occur in other settings,
such as pulmonary embolism and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.[105] [106] [107] They are sensitive to other biologic
factors, such as age, sex, weight, and renal function. Elevated
levels lend support to a diagnosis of abnormal ventricular function
or hemodynamics causing symptomatic HF.[108] [109] [110] A
low plasma BNP level (<100 picograms/mL) can rapidly rule out
decompensated HF and point to a pulmonary cause. A high plasma
BNP level (>400 picograms/mL) strongly supports the diagnosis
of abnormal ventricular function (i.e., HF). Intermediate values
(100-400 picograms/mL) fall into the so-called "gray zone" and
should spur a search for a potential noncardiac cause of dyspnea: for
example, COPD. In patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement
of natriuretic peptide biomarkers is useful to support a diagnosis or
exclude HF. However, elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides
can occur with a wide variety of cardiac and noncardiac causes;
therefore, clinical judgment is necessary.
• In patients with relevant symptoms and/or signs, a BNP level of ≥35
picograms/mL in ambulatory patients and ≥100 picograms/mL in
hospitalized patients, or NT-pro-BNP level of ≥125 picograms/mL in

• Trials with this diagnostic marker suggest that its use may reduce
both the time to hospital discharge and the cost of treatment.[111]
[112] [113] BNP levels tend to be less elevated in HF with preserved
ejection fraction than in HF with low ejection fraction and are lower in
obese patients.[114] Levels of BNP may be elevated in women and
in people over 60 years of age who do not have HF, and thus BNP
levels should be interpreted cautiously in such individuals.[74] [115]

Aging/physical inactivity • Aging, deconditioning, and/
or obesity may cause a
reduction in effort tolerance
due to dyspnea and/or
fatigue, but without the
additional major and minor
criteria for diagnosing HF.
• Elucidation of the precise
reason for exercise
intolerance can be difficult
because several disorders
may coexist in the same
patient. Echocardiography
in HF shows characteristic
signs of HF. However, a clear
distinction can sometimes be
made only by measurements
of gas exchange or blood
oxygen saturation or by
invasive hemodynamic
measurements during
graded levels of exercise
(i.e., cardiopulmonary
exercise test with VO₂ max).
COPD/pulmonary fibrosis • Dyspnea may be episodic,
with or without environmental
triggers, and is usually
accompanied by cough,
wheezing, sputum, and
a history of smoking or
industrial exposure.
• Pulmonary function tests
will give definite diagnosis of
an obstructive or restrictive
pulmonary disease. Plasma
B-type natriuretic peptide
levels may be intermediate
(100-400 picograms/mL) in
COPD.
Pneumonia • Patients may present with
fever, cough, and productive
sputum, with focal signs of
consolidation (increased
vocal fremitus and bronchial
breathing).
• CXR may show signs of
consolidation. CBC may
show elevated WBC, and
blood cultures may be
positive for the etiologic
organism.
Pulmonary embolism (PE) • Sudden onset of chest pain,
dyspnea, and hemoptysis,
especially after childbirth,
are suggestive of PE.[117]
Dyspnea with or without
chest pain may be present in
other conditions associated
with venous thrombosis and
PE (e.g., cancer, prolonged
immobilization, postoperative
state).

Criteria
New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification[118]
This classification is symptom-based and has primarily been used as shorthand to describe functional
limitations. HF symptoms may progress from one class to the next in a given patient, but can also follow the
path in reverse; for example, a patient with NYHA class IV symptoms might have quick improvement to class
III with diuretic therapy alone.

results in fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea.
• Class III: Moderate. Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but gentle activity
causes fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea.
• Class IV: Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac
insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.
Universal definition and classification of heart failure: stages of

Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of congestive HF[35]
HF is essentially a clinical diagnosis. Clinical criteria for diagnosing HF, the Framingham criteria for the
diagnosis of congestive HF, were established before the widespread use of echocardiographic assessment
of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The Framingham clinical criteria, listed below, have been extremely
useful for identifying HF patients, both in clinical practice and in epidemiologic studies, for more than 40
years. However, because their specificity is greater than their sensitivity, it is recognized that they probably
miss mild cases of HF. In order to come up with a definite diagnosis of congestive HF, one needs to have
either 2 major criteria or the combination of 1 major and 2 minor criteria.

Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology
(HFA-ESC) 2018 criteria for the definition of advanced HF[9] [119]
For a diagnosis of advanced HF, the following criteria must be present despite optimal medical treatment:
• Severe and persistent symptoms of HF (NYHA class III or IV)
• Severe cardiac dysfunction defined by left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤30%, isolated right
ventricular failure, nonoperable severe valvular abnormalities, nonoperable severe congenital
abnormalities, or persistently high (or increasing) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels and severe diastolic dysfunction or LV structural
abnormalities (according to the ESC definitions of HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF] and HF
with mildly reduced ejection fraction [HFmrEF])
• Episodes of pulmonary or systemic congestion requiring high-dose intravenous diuretics or episodes
of low output requiring inotropes or vasoactive drugs or malignant arrhythmias causing >1 unplanned
hospitalization in the last 12 months
• Severe impairment of exercise capacity with inability to exercise or low 6-minute walk test (<300 m) or
pVO₂ <12 mL/kg/minute or <50% predicted value, estimated to be of cardiac origin.
Screening
There is no single test for screening the asymptomatic population. HF is a clinical diagnosis and as such
could simply rely on a thorough history and careful physical examination of the population to be tested.
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been used as a screening tool for identifying structural heart disease
in the general population. In one study, the sensitivity and specificity of BNP testing for identification of
structural heart disease were 61% and 92%, respectively.[120] When sex-specific analyses were performed,
sensitivity and specificity were 61% and 91% in men, and 50% and 95% in women, respectively. Although

the performance of BNP testing on the basis of these figures might seem suboptimal for the population as
a whole, efficacy was improved in subgroups with a high prevalence of heart disease, such as the cohort
ages 65 years and older, as well as the cohort having cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or
diabetes. In another trial, blood N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations were found to play
an important role in stratifying older people into left ventricular dysfunction risk groups. The neurohormone
was an independent marker for death or admission for HF in the medium term.[121] These results suggest
that BNP testing for structural heart disease screening in community-based populations might only be useful
for cohorts with a high prevalence of heart disease. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines recommend that for patients at risk of developing HF
(identified by the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or known vascular disease), natriuretic peptide
biomarker-based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist optimizing
guideline-directed management and therapy, can be useful to prevent the development of left ventricular
dysfunction (systolic or diastolic) or new-onset HF.[7]

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Goals of treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) are to:
• Alleviate symptoms
• Delay progression
• Reduce mortality
The following recommendations cover management of chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF<40%)
or mildly reduced ejection fraction (EF 41% to 49%).
For details of management of acute exacerbation of HF, please see Acute heart failure .
For details of management of patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥50%), please see Heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction .
General principles of therapy
Recommended initial therapies include:[7] [9] [124]
• Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [ARNi], ACE inhibitor,
or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist)
• Beta-blockers
• Aldosterone antagonists
• Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors
For most patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a combination of drugs from all four
of these medication classes should be started and continued long term.[7] [9] [124] Medications may be
started simultaneously or sequentially. Patients who have signs of congestion and volume overload will
need diuretics.
Additional therapies, including implantable devices, may be considered in selected patients.
Lifestyle changes
The success of pharmacologic therapy is strongly related to, and greatly enhanced by, encouraging
the patient and his/her family to participate in various complementary nonpharmacologic management
strategies. These mainly include lifestyle changes, dietary and nutritional modifications, exercise training,
and health maintenance.[125]
In patients with HF, cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training improves functional status, exercise
tolerance, and quality of life, with decreased morbidity and mortality.[126] [127] [128][129] [130] [131]
[132] [133] [134] Patients with stable HF who are able to participate are therefore encouraged to do
regular exercise and enrol in a cardiac rehabilitation program.[7] [9] There is developing evidence to
support home-based cardiac rehabilitation alternatives to center-based programs.[135] [136] [137]
Dietary sodium intake is an easily modifiable factor that complements pharmacologic therapy for HF.
There is limited evidence for restriction of sodium in patients with HF; however, guidelines recommend
that excessive sodium intake should be avoided.[7] [9] [124] [138]

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
Management of comorbidities
Screening and treatment of common comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial
fibrillation (AF), iron deficiency, hypertension, sleep disorders, diabetes, and coronary artery disease
(CAD) is an important factor in the management of patients with HF.[7] [9] Consult your local drug
information source for details of cautions, contraindications, and dose adjustments that may be required in
the presence of comorbid conditions.
See below for more information on management of HF with specific comorbidities.
Drugs that may be harmful and should be avoided in patients with HFrEF include: nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil); class IC antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone,
flecainide) and dronedarone; thiazolidinediones (e.g., rosiglitazone, pioglitazone); dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g., alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin); and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs).[7]
Initial drug treatments
Diuretics
• All patients with symptoms and signs of congestion should receive diuretics, irrespective of the
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In patients with reduced LVEF, diuretics should always be
used in combination with other guideline-directed medical therapy (e.g., ARNi or ACE inhibitor or
angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor [see
below for details on use]).[7] [9]
• Loop diuretics used for the treatment of HF and congestion include furosemide, bumetanide, and
torsemide. The most commonly used agent appears to be furosemide, but some patients may
respond more favorably to another loop diuretic.[139] In resistant cases, loop diuretics should
be combined with a thiazide diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) or a thiazide-like diuretic (e.g.,
metolazone, indapamide).
• Loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics differ in their pharmacologic actions. Loop diuretics increase
excretion of up to 20% to 25% of the filtered load of sodium, enhance free-water clearance, and
maintain their efficacy unless renal function is severely impaired. In contrast, thiazide diuretics
increase the fractional excretion of sodium to only 5% to 10% of the filtered load, tend to decrease
free-water clearance, and lose their effectiveness in patients with impaired renal function (i.e.,
creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/minute).
• Careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is essential. The minimum dose of diuretic
should be used to relieve congestion, keep the patient asymptomatic, and maintain a dry weight.
Some patients may be able to come off the diuretics completely, but they need very close long-term
follow-up.
ARNi
• In the PARADIGM-HF trial, in patients with HFrEF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II
to IV) and ejection fraction of 40% or less (which was later changed to an ejection fraction of 35%
or less), sacubitril/valsartan (a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist, or ARNi) was superior to enalapril in reducing mortality and HF hospitalization.[140] In
this study, the ejection fraction was 29 ± 6.1% in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 29.4 ± 6.3% in
the enalapril group.[140] Meta-analyses have found that sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduces
clinical outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalizations for

MANAGEMENT
heart failure, especially among patients with reduced EF.[141] [142] [143] Sacubitril/valsartan has
also been found to improve a patient's physical and social activities compared with enalapril.[144]
• The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure
Society of America (HFSA) guidelines recommend sacubitril/valsartan for all patients with HFrEF
and NYHA class II to III symptoms, in preference to an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist, because of improvement in morbidity and mortality.[7]
• European guidelines recommend sacubitril/valsartan as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor in
patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with an ACE inhibitor, a
beta-blocker, an aldosterone antagonist, and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, to
reduce the risk of hospitalization and death.[9]
• Guidelines advise that use of an ARNi may be considered in patients with mildly reduced ejection
fraction (HFmrEF) to reduce risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality.[7] [9]
• Concomitant administration of an ARNi with an ACE inhibitor, or within 36 hours of the last dose of
an ACE inhibitor, is not recommended.[7]
ACE inhibitors
• ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with HFrEF.
US guidelines recommend the use of ACE inhibitors when use of ARNi is not feasible in patients
with HFrEF.[7] European and UK guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors in all patients with HFrEF
unless contraindicated or not tolerated.[9] [124]
• Guidelines advise that use of an ACE inhibitor may be considered in patients with HFmrEF to
reduce risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality.[7] [9] [145]
• When using an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker for HF, in practice most physicians start an ACE
inhibitor first and then add a beta-blocker; the origin of this practice is historic, as the benefits of
ACE inhibitors were demonstrated 10 years before those of beta-blockers. Also, most large-scale
studies of beta-blockers were conducted using ACE-inhibitor therapy as comparator or standard. If
a patient cannot tolerate target doses of both an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker when these drugs
are co-administered, it is preferable to co-administer lower doses of both drugs than to reach the
target dose in one class and not be able to initiate the other.
Beta-blockers
• Beta-blockers have also been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with HF.[7]
[9] [124] All patients with HFrEF receive a beta-blocker, unless there is a contraindication based on
bradycardia, reactive airway disease, and unstable or low-output HF.[7] [9] [124] They are initiated
at low doses and titrated to target dosages.[7] [9] [124] [146]
• Patients with sinus rhythm: one meta-analysis found that, irrespective of pretreatment heart rate,
beta-blockers reduced mortality in patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm.[147] Achieving a lower
heart rate is associated with better prognosis for patients in sinus rhythm. Mortality was lower
for patients in sinus rhythm randomized to beta-blockers (hazard ratio: 0.73 vs. placebo; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 0.79; P <0.001), regardless of baseline heart rate (interaction P =
0.35).
• Patients with atrial fibrillation: the same meta-analysis found that beta-blockers had no effect on
mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio: 0.96; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12; P = 0.58) at
any heart rate (interaction P = 0.48).[147] However, this was a retrospective analysis and authors
commented that background therapy, including devices, may have changed since these trials
were conducted and that the heart rate was not measured in a standardized fashion across the
trials. In a randomized trial of patients with atrial fibrillation and HFrEF, during a median follow-up
of 37 months, beta-blockers were associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (hazard

ratio: 0.721; 95% CI 0.549 to 0.945; P = 0.0180) but not hospitalization (hazard ratio: 0.886;
95% CI 0.715 to 1.100; P = 0.2232).[148] The result of this study supports the evidence-based
recommendations for beta-blockers in patients with HFrEF, whether or not they have associated
atrial fibrillation.
• Although adverse effects can include bradycardia, worsening of reactive airway disease, and
worsening HF, these can often be avoided by careful patient selection, dose titration, and close
monitoring. Clinical improvement may be delayed and may take 2-3 months to become apparent.
However, long-term treatment with beta-blockers can lessen the symptoms of HF and improve
clinical status.
• Guidelines advise that evidence-based beta-blockers for HFrEF may be considered in patients with
HFmrEF to reduce risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality.[7] [9] [145]
Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists
• Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are considered a reasonable alternative to an ARNi or an
ACE inhibitor in patients with HFrEF who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors because of cough or
angioedema and when use of ARNi is not feasible.[7] [9] [124][149] Experience with these drugs
in controlled clinical trials of patients with HF is considerably less than that with ACE inhibitors.
Nevertheless, valsartan and candesartan have demonstrated benefit by reducing hospitalizations
and mortality.[7] [150]
• Guidelines advise that use of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be considered in patients
with HFmrEF to reduce risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality.[7] [9] [145]
• The addition of an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist to the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an
aldosterone antagonist is not recommended in patients with HF, because of the increased risk of
renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia.[9]
Aldosterone antagonists
• Aldosterone antagonists (sometimes known as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) such as
spironolactone and eplerenone are recommended in patients with HFrEF to reduce mortality and
morbidity.[7] [9]
• Guidelines advise that use of an aldosterone antagonist may be considered in patients with
HFmrEF to reduce risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality.[7] [9] [145]
• Spironolactone and eplerenone can both cause hyperkalemia, and precautions should be taken to
minimize the risk; regular monitoring of serum potassium and renal function is recommended.[7]
[9] In the EPHESUS trial, the addition of eplerenone to standard care did not increase the risk of
hyperkalemia when potassium was regularly monitored.[151]
SGLT2 inhibitors
• An SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) is recommended, in addition to optimal
medical therapy with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and an aldosterone
antagonist, for patients with HFrEF regardless of diabetes status.[7] [9] [152] [153] [154]
• SGLT2 inhibitors are also recommended for patients with HFmrEF, to reduce HF hospitalizations
and cardiovascular mortality.[7] [145] [155] [156]
• Two key randomized controlled trials, DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced, compared dapagliflozin
and empagliflozin, respectively, with placebo in patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF, LVEF
≤40%, and on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT).[157] [158] In both trials, the risk of
worsening HF or death from cardiovascular causes was lower among those who received an
SGLT2 inhibitor than among those who received placebo, regardless of the presence or absence
of diabetes.[152] [159] [160] [161] [162][163] [164][165] SGLT2 inhibitors also slowed the rate of

MANAGEMENT
renal function decline in patients with and without diabetes and reduced levels of uric acid.[158]
[166] [167] [168] [169] In the EMPEROR-Reduced trial, the benefit of empagliflozin on major heart
failure events was seen in patients across the spectrum of baseline kidney function.[170] Effects
were sustained for 1-3 years of treatment and reversed after withdrawal.[171]
• The DELIVER trial found that dapagliflozin reduced the combined risk of worsening HF or
cardiovascular death among patients with HF and a mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction,
both in those with and without history of recent HF hospitalization, across the spectrum of
baseline kidney function and glycemic range, and regardless of the duration of heart failure.[172]
[173][174] [175] [176] [177] [178] [179] [180] [181] The effects were also similar regardless of
background diuretic use, and dapagliflozin was also associated with a reduced likelihood of diuretic
initiation.[182] Overall health status, as reported by KCCQ, was improved with dapagliflozin.[183]
[184] Improvements in symptoms, physical function, and quality of life were larger in patients
with the greatest level of frailty.[185] In a pooled analysis of DELIVER and DAPA-HF trials, the
response to dapagliflozin was similar between men and women across the range of EF.[186]
Another pooled analysis found that the benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent irrespective of
gout, and dapagliflozin use was associated with a reduction in the initiation of new treatments for
hyperuricemia and gout.[187] Pooled analysis from the DEFINE-HF and PRESERVED-HF trials
found that dapagliflozin produced significant improvements in symptoms and physical limitations
across the full range of EF.[188]
• Meta-analyses have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and
hospitalizations for HF in a broad range of patients with HF.[189] [190] [191] [192][193][194]
[195] [196] [197] [198] In one meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials involving 20,241 patients
with HF, SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared
with placebo, and the composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalizations/urgent visits for
HF was reduced with SGLT2 inhibitors across subgroups of sex, age, race, eGFR, functional
class, and ejection fraction.[190] Another meta-analysis found that in HFpEF and HFmrEF, SGLT2
inhibitors, ARNi, and aldosterone antagonists were associated with a significant decrease in the
risk of heart failure hospitalization compared with placebo, with SGLT2 inhibitors the optimal drug
class in terms of reducing the risk for heart failure hospitalization. Combining data from three
randomized controlled trials (PRESERVED-HF, DEFINE-HF [Dapagliflozin Effect on Symptoms and
Biomarkers in Patients With Heart Failure], and CHIEF-HF [A Study on Impact of Canagliflozin on
Health Status, Quality of Life, and Functional Status in Heart Failure]) found that treatment with an
SGLT2 inhibitor resulted in health status improvements for both black and white patients with heart
failure.[199] One meta-analysis looking at adverse events found that SGLT2 inhibitor use was not
associated with a clinically relevant risk of hypotension and volume depletion, and the risk of acute
kidney injury was reduced.[200]
Additional treatments
Hydralazine and nitrates
• The addition of a combination of hydralazine and a nitrate is reasonable for patients with reduced
LVEF who have persistent symptoms despite receiving optimal medical therapy, and it has
demonstrated benefit in black patients with HF.[201] [202]
• Guidelines recommend considering the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate for
black patients with NYHA class III to IV HFrEF receiving optimal medical therapy to improve
symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality.[7] [9] [124]

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
• The combined use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate may also be considered as a therapeutic
option in symptomatic patients who cannot receive renin-angiotensin system inhibitors because of
intolerance or contraindications; consultation with a specialist is advised.[7] [9]
Ivabradine
• Ivabradine can be considered for patients with stable, symptomatic chronic HF with LVEF ≤35%,
who are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute (UK National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence guidelines advise ≥75 beats per minute) and are either on a maximum
dose of a beta-blocker or have a contraindication to beta-blockers.[7] [9] [124]
• One meta-analysis found that addition of ivabradine to standard HF therapy was associated with
cardiac function improvement, reduction on worsening HF readmission, greater HR reduction, and
better exercise capacity in chronic HFrEF patients, but it was not associated with a reduction in
cardiovascular mortality or improvement in quality of life.[203] One Cochrane review concluded that
long‐term treatment with ivabradine in patients with HFrEF does not reduce cardiovascular mortality
or rate of serious adverse events compared with placebo/usual care/no treatment.[204]
Digoxin
• Digoxin can be beneficial in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF or reduced LVEF,
especially those with atrial fibrillation. When added to ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics,
digoxin can reduce symptoms, prevent hospitalization, control rhythm, and enhance exercise
tolerance.[205] Digoxin reduces the composite end point of mortality or hospitalizations in
ambulatory patients with chronic HF with NYHA class III or IV symptoms, LVEF <25%, or
cardiothoracic ratio of >55% and should be considered in these patients.[206]
• Digoxin reduces the composite end point of mortality or hospitalizations, but does not reduce all-
cause mortality.[206] Digoxin should be used cautiously with plasma level monitoring. One meta-
analysis suggests that digoxin use in patients with HF is associated with a higher risk of all-cause
mortality.[207]
• One systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and controlled trial data showed that
digoxin has a neutral effect on mortality in randomized trials and reduces hospital admissions.[208]
Vericiguat
• Vericiguat, an oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, may be considered in selected high-
risk patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II-IV symptoms, who have had worsening HF despite
treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARNi, a beta-blocker, and an aldosterone antagonist, to reduce
the risk of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization.[7] [9]
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
• In patients with NYHA class II to IV symptoms and HF who are already on GDMT and other
evidence-based therapies, omega-3 PUFA supplementation may be reasonable to use as
adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.[7]
Vasopressin antagonists
• Use of vasopressin antagonists such as tolvaptan can be considered for patients with symptomatic
or severe hyponatremia (<130 mmol/L) and persistent congestion despite standard therapy, to
correct hyponatremia and related symptoms.[7] [9]
Cardiac implantable devices
• Device therapy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy
(CRT) should be considered in selected patients to reduce mortality and morbidity.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
MANAGEMENT
• ICDs have been shown to decrease mortality in patients with HF, both ischemic and nonischemic,
by reducing risk of sudden cardiac death. The SCD-Heft trial enrolled patients who had left
ventricular dysfunction and no prior history of syncope or sustained ventricular tachycardia, and
included patients with a prior myocardial infarction and no prior coronary artery disease. Use of
ICDs led to a 23% relative mortality risk reduction at 5 years.[209]
• It has been estimated that one quarter to one third of patients with HF have left bundle-branch
block (LBBB): that is, manifest a QRS duration greater than 120 milliseconds (ms).[210] Patients
with HFrEF who have LBBB, known as ventricular dyssynchrony, have a poorer prognosis
than those without LBBB.[211] Studies have shown that, in these patients, CRT decreases
hospitalization and, when combined with an ICD, significantly reduces mortality.[212] [213]
[214] [215] [216] [217] In patients who have conduction delay and left ventricular dysfunction,
biventricular pacemakers have been shown to improve exercise tolerance and quality of life while
decreasing morbidity and mortality.[212] [213] [214] [215] [217] [218] [219] [220] The CARE-HF
study randomized patients with a widened QRS, LVEF of 35% or less, and persistent moderate
or severe symptoms of HF despite pharmacologic therapy, to implantation of a CRT device or
not.[221] The main study observed substantial benefits on morbidity and mortality that persisted
or increased with longer follow-up.[222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] [232]
 Reduction in mortality was due to fewer deaths from HF and from reduced sudden death.[222]
 Long-term data from the REVERSE study suggest that improvements in left ventricular function
and remodeling can be sustained for over 5 years.[233] [234]
• ICDs are recommended to reduce sudden cardiac death and mortality in selected patients when
there is a reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for at least 1 year, LVEF is ≤35% (NYHA
class II-III) or ≤30% (NYHA class I) despite GDMT, and the patient is at least 40 days post-
myocardial infarction.[7] [9] Specific indications vary in different countries, and guidelines should be
consulted for full details.
• CRT is recommended in selected patients to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve
symptoms. It can be used as a pacemaker alone (CRT-P) or combined with an ICD (CRT-D).
Broadly, CRT is recommended in patients with LVEF ≤35% despite GDMT, who are in sinus
rhythm, with a LBBB and QRS ≥150 ms.[7] [9] [235] CRT should also be considered in those with
LBBB and QRS ≥120-149 ms or those with a non-LBBB pattern and QRS ≥150 ms. Again, specific
indications vary in different countries, and guidelines should be consulted for full details.
Advanced heart failure
Patients with indicators of advanced HF require timely referral to specialist care to assess suitability
for management options that may include cardiac transplantation, mechanical circulatory support, and
palliative care.[7] [9] [236]
Early referral is important so options may be offered before development of end-organ dysfunction. US
guidelines note that the acronym I-Need-Help can help in identifying patients for referral:[7] [237]
• I: intravenous inotropes
• N: New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIB/IV or persistently elevated natriuretic peptides
• E: end-organ dysfunction
• E: ejection fraction ≤35%
• D: defibrillator shocks
• H: hospitalizations >1
• E: edema despite escalating diuretics
• L: low systolic blood pressure ≤90, high heart rate

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
• P: prognostic medication; progressive intolerance or down-titration of GDMT.
Inotropic support:
• Intravenous inotropic support may improve hemodynamic compromise, increasing cardiac output,
and maintaining perfusion. In patients with advanced HF refractory to optimal medical and device
therapy, prolonged inotropic support may be used as a bridge to long-term mechanical circulatory
support or cardiac transplant.[7]
• Continuous intravenous inotropic support may also be considered as palliative therapy for the relief
of symptoms in patients without other treatment options.[7] [9]
Mechanical circulatory support (MCS):
• MCS helps to maintain sufficient end organ perfusion by unloading the heart. Temporary MCS,
such as percutaneous and extracorporeal ventricular assist devices, may be used in patients with
advanced HF and hemodynamic compromise or shock as a bridge to recovery or bridge to decision
about future care.[7] [9] Long-term MCS, such as a durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD),
is considered in carefully selected patients who have end-stage HF despite optimal medical and
device therapy, or dependence on intravenous inotropes or temporary MCS, either as a bridge to
transplantation or as destination therapy (permanent pump implantation in patients not eligible for
cardiac transplantation).[7] [9] [238][239]
• Some of the absolute contraindications for providing durable mechanical support include
irreversible hepatic, renal, and neurologic disease, medical nonadherence, and severe
psychosocial limitations.[240]
Cardiac transplantation:
• Cardiac transplantation significantly improves quality of life and functional status and is the
established treatment for eligible patients with advanced HF refractory to optimal medical and
device therapy.[7] [9]
Palliative and supportive care:
• Palliative and supportive care should be provided to all patients with HF to improve quality of life,
and this care intensifies as disease progresses to advanced and end-of-life stages.[7] [9]
• Palliative and supportive care is a multidisciplinary approach that includes high-quality
communication, discussion of prognosis, shared decision-making, advance care planning, relief
from pain and other distressing symptoms, attention to emotional, psychological, and spiritual
aspects of care, and support for families and caregivers during illness and bereavement.[7] [9]
Considerations for management of specific comorbidities
Anemia/iron-deficiency:
• In patients with HFrEF or HFmrEF and iron deficiency (ferritin level <100 nanograms/mL or 100
to 300 nanograms/mL, with transferrin saturation <20%) with or without anemia, intravenous iron
supplementation is recommended to improve symptoms and quality of life.[7] [9] [145] European
guidelines also recommend considering intravenous iron supplementation to reduce risk of HF
hospitalization.[145]
• Meta-analyses have shown an association between intravenous iron supplementation and
lower rates of recurrent cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality.[241] [242] [243] One
prospective randomized trial in the UK (IRONMAN) found that in patients with HFrEF and iron
deficiency, intravenous iron supplementation was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and
cardiovascular death.[244] Another randomized trial (HEART-FID) found no significant difference

between intravenous iron supplementation and placebo for the composite endpoint of death,
hospitalizations for heart failure, or 6-minute walk distance.[245]
• Oral iron is not recommended. The IRONOUT HF trial found that oral iron does not adequately treat
iron deficiency anemia in patients with HFrEF.[246]
• Due to a lack of benefit and an increased risk of adverse events such as stroke, erythropoietin-
stimulating agents are not recommended for the treatment of anemia in patients with HF.[7]
• For more details on management, see Iron-deficiency anemia (Management approach) .
AF:
• AF and HF may cause or exacerbate each other and the relationship is complex. HF therapies
should be optimized. Beta-blockers may be used in HFrEF whether or not the patient has
associated AF.[147] [148] Treatment of AF involves correction of the abnormal rate/rhythm, along
with anticoagulation. Options for rate and rhythm control are determined by the presence of HF and
extent of LV dysfunction.[7] [9]
• For details of management of patients with AF and HF, see Established atrial fibrillation
(Management approach) .
Hypertension:
• Treatment of HFrEF is similar in patients with and without hypertension.[9] Recommended
medications for HF also lower BP; however, HF guidelines note that clinical trials assessing the
impact of BP reduction on outcomes in patients with hypertension and HF are lacking and that the
optimal BP goal and antihypertensive regimen are not known.[7] [9]
• The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines suggest that in patients with HFrEF and hypertension,
guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF can be uptitrated to the maximally tolerated
target dose, to achieve blood pressure targets.[7]
• In people with HF, hypertension and mild fluid retention, thiazide diuretics may be preferred over
loop diuretics as they confer more persistent antihypertensive effects.
• For more details on management of hypertension, see Essential hypertension (Management
approach) .
CKD:
• The effectiveness of GDMT for HF in patients with concomitant CKD is uncertain.[247] Some
drugs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and a dose adjustment may be
required. Some drugs may also be contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. Check your
local drug information source for more information.
• Most patients will tolerate mild-to-moderate degrees of functional renal impairment without difficulty.
Initiation of GDMT for HF with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, ARNi, or SGLT2
inhibitor may result in an initial rise in serum creatinine and a drop in estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR), but this change is generally transient and should not necessarily be a reason for
discontinuation.[9] [248]
• An increase in serum creatinine of <50% above baseline, up to 3 mg/dL, or a decrease
in eGFR of <10% from baseline, as long as eGFR is >25 mL/minute/1.73 m², may be
considered as acceptable
• If the serum creatinine increases to >3 mg/dL, the renal insufficiency can severely limit the
efficacy and enhance the toxicity of established treatments.[249] [250]

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
• Aldosterone antagonists should be used with caution in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. US
guidelines advise that they are only initiated in patients with eGFR >30 mL/minute/1.73 m² and
serum potassium <5.0 mEq/L.[7]
• Consult with a nephrology specialist should be considered.
• See Chronic kidney disease (Management approach) .
Diabetes:
• Treatment of HFrEF is similar in patients with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors are
recommended as first-line treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and HF to
reduce HF-related morbidity and mortality.[7] [9] See information above on SGLT2 inhibitors.
• Finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is recommended for the
prevention of HF hospitalization in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes.[145]
• See Overview of diabetes .
Obesity:
• Treatment of obesity in patients with HFrEF may improve symptoms, functional status, quality
of life, and comorbidities.[38] In advanced HF, weight loss in patients with obesity may allow the
option of heart transplantation (obesity may be a contraindication).
• Obesity has a stronger association with HF with preserved EF, and in those patients treatment of
obesity with a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist have shown symptomatic benefit.
More studies are needed for HFrEF.
• See Obesity in adults .
Chronic coronary disease:
• Patients with HF should be assessed for presence of CAD. In selected patients with CAD and HF
with LVEF ≤35% and suitable coronary anatomy, surgical revascularization in addition to GDMT
may improve symptoms, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and long-term all-cause mortality.[7] [9]
• For more details, see Chronic coronary disease (Management approach) .
Valvular heart disease (VHD):
• Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation are associated
with adverse outcomes in patients with HF and timely management (by a multidisciplinary team
with expertise in HF and VHD) is important to prevent worsening of HF.[7] [9]
• For more details, see Aortic stenosis (Management approach) , Aortic regurgitation (Management
approach) , Mitral regurgitation (Management approach) , Tricuspid regurgitation (Management
approach) .
Hyperlipidemia:
• All patients with HFrEF and hyperlipidemia will need lifestyle modifications and most will also
require treatment with a statin possibly with additional non-statin lipid-lowering therapy.
• For details of management of HF with hypercholesterolemia, see Hypercholesterolemia
(Management approach) .
Thyroid disorders:
• Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism are associated with HF and assessment of thyroid function is
recommended.
• Thyroid disorders are treated as per endocrinology guidelines; referral to endocrinologist should be
considered.
• See Overview of thyroid dysfunction .

Sleep disorders:
• Patients with HF and daytime sleepiness may have sleep studies to assess for obstructive sleep
apnea and central sleep apnea.[7] [9]
• In patients with HF and obstructive sleep apnea, continuous positive airway pressure is
recommended to improve sleep quality and reduce daytime sleepiness; however, it does not seem
to reduce mortality.[7] [9]
• Adaptive servo-ventilation has been associated with increased mortality and is not recommended
for the treatment of central sleep apnea in patients with HFrEF.[7] [9]
• See Obstructive sleep apnea in adults  and Central sleep apnea .
Depression:
• Depression is common in patients with HF and is associated with a reduced quality of life and
increased mortality. Treatment with conventional therapies (e.g., antidepressants) does not seem
to directly improve these outcomes. However, interventions that focus on improving HF self-care
(e.g., psychotherapy, nurse-led support) may reduce hospitalization and mortality in patients with
moderate or severe depression.[7] [9]
• See Depression in adults .
Cancer:
• Patients who develop HF and/or depressed LV systolic function secondary to cancer therapy should
be treated with GDMT. Generally, GDMT should not be discontinued unless there are specific and
compelling reasons to hold these medications and this should be managed by a multidisciplinary
team. Before starting any cardiotoxic cancer therapy, baseline cardiac function should be measured
and ongoing monitoring after completion of a course of chemotherapy may be helpful for risk
stratification.[7] [9]
Special consideration: amyloidosis
HF GDMT may be poorly tolerated in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy. Tafamidis (a transthyretin
stabilizer) may be considered in select patients to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[7] [9]
See Amyloidosis .

» An SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., dapagliflozin,
empagliflozin) is recommended, in addition to
optimal medical therapy with a renin-angiotensin
system inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and an
aldosterone antagonist, for patients with HF with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) regardless of
diabetes status.[7] [9] [152] [153] [154]
plus lifestyle changes
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» The success of pharmacologic therapy is
strongly related to, and greatly enhanced by,
encouraging the patient and his/her family
to participate in various complementary
nonpharmacologic management strategies.
These mainly include lifestyle changes, dietary
and nutritional modifications, exercise training,
and health maintenance.[125]
» In patients with HF, cardiac rehabilitation and
exercise training improves functional status,
exercise tolerance, and quality of life, with
decreased morbidity and mortality.[126] [127]
[128][129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] Patients
with stable HF who are able to participate are
therefore encouraged to do regular exercise
and enrol in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
[7] [9] There is developing evidence to support
home-based cardiac rehabilitation alternatives to
center-based programs.[135] [136] [137]
» Dietary sodium intake is an easily modifiable
factor that complements pharmacologic
therapy for HF. There is limited evidence for
sodium restriction in patients with HF; however,
guidelines recommend that excessive sodium
intake should be avoided.[7] [9] [124] [138]
» Patients with HF need continuous and close
monitoring of their health. A variety of programs
have been shown to decrease morbidity and
rehospitalization in this context, including home
nursing, telephone advice/triage, telemedicine
services, and specialized HF clinic-based
care.[254]

» All patients with symptoms and signs of
congestion should receive a diuretic, irrespective
of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In
patients with reduced LVEF, diuretics should be
used in combination with other guideline-directed
medical therapy (e.g., a renin-angiotensin
system inhibitor, beta-blocker, and aldosterone
antagonist).[7] [9]
» Loop diuretics used for the treatment of HF
and congestion include furosemide, bumetanide,
and torsemide. The most commonly used
agent appears to be furosemide, but some
patients may respond more favorably to another
loop diuretic. In resistant cases, loop diuretics
should be combined with a thiazide diuretic
(e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) or a thiazide-like
diuretic (e.g., metolazone, indapamide). Careful
monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is
essential in these patients.
» The minimum dose of diuretic should be
used to relieve congestion, keep the patient
asymptomatic, and maintain a dry weight.
In patients with stable congestive HF, loop
diuretics are the preferred agent. In patients
with comorbid hypertension and only mild fluid
retention, a thiazide diuretic may be considered.

» Diuretics produce symptomatic benefits more
rapidly than any other drug for HF. They can
relieve pulmonary and peripheral edema within
hours or days. Few patients with HF and fluid
retention can maintain sodium balance without
the use of diuretic drugs.[255]
» In intermediate-term studies, diuretics have
been shown to improve cardiac function,

» The addition of a combination of hydralazine
and a nitrate is reasonable for patients with
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
who have persistent symptoms despite receiving
optimal medical therapy and has demonstrated
benefit in black patients with HF.[201] [202]
» Guidelines recommend the combination of
hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate for black
patients with New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class III to IV HF with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF) receiving optimal medical
therapy, to improve symptoms and reduce
morbidity and mortality.[7] [9] [124]
» The combined use of hydralazine and
isosorbide dinitrate may also be considered
as a therapeutic option in symptomatic
patients who cannot receive renin-angiotensin
system inhibitors because of intolerance or
contraindications; consultation with a specialist is
advised.[7] [9]

» Ivabradine can be considered for patients
with stable, symptomatic chronic HF with left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%, who
are in sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate
≥70 beats per minute (UK National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guidelines
advise ≥75 beats per minute) and are either on
a maximum dose of beta-blockers or have a
contraindication to beta-blockers.[7] [9] [124]
» Its use should be initiated by a specialist
cardiologist and only after a stabilization period
of 4 weeks on optimized standard therapy.[257]
 Patients should be on a maximally tolerated
dose of a beta-blocker prior to initiation.
adjunct digoxin
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» digoxin: 62.5 to 250 micrograms orally once
daily
» Digoxin can be beneficial in patients with
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),
especially those with atrial fibrillation.
» When added to ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers,
and diuretics, digoxin can reduce symptoms,
prevent hospitalization, control rhythm, and
enhance exercise tolerance.[205]
» Digoxin reduces the composite end point
of mortality or hospitalizations in ambulatory
patients with chronic HF with New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms,
LVEF <25%, or cardiothoracic ratio of >55% and
should be considered in these patients.[206]

» Digoxin reduces the composite end point
of mortality or hospitalizations, but does not
reduce all-cause mortality.[206] Digoxin should
be used cautiously with plasma level monitoring;
one meta-analysis suggests that digoxin use in
patients with HF is associated with a higher risk
of all-cause mortality.[207]
» Overt digitalis toxicity is commonly associated
with serum digoxin levels >2 nanograms/mL.
However, toxicity may occur with lower levels,
especially if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or
hypothyroidism coexists.[258] [259]
» Lower doses should be used initially if the
patient is over 70 years old, has impaired renal
function, or has a low lean body mass.[260]
 Higher doses are rarely used or needed. There
is no reason to use loading doses of digoxin to
initiate therapy.

stimulator, may be considered in selected
high-risk patients with HF with reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF) and New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class II to IV symptoms,
who have had worsening HF despite treatment
with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor
neprilysin inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and an
aldosterone antagonist to reduce the risk of
cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization.[7]

adjunct implantable device therapy
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Device therapy with implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT) should be considered in selected
patients to reduce mortality and morbidity.
» ICDs are recommended to reduce sudden
cardiac death and mortality in selected patients
when there is a reasonable expectation of
meaningful survival for at least 1 year, left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ≤35% (New
York Heart Association [NYHA] class II-III) or
≤30% (NYHA class I) despite guideline-directed
medical therapy (GDMT), and the patient is at
least 40 days post-myocardial infarction.[7] [9]
Specific indications vary in different countries,
and guidelines should be consulted for full
details.
» CRT is recommended in selected patients
to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve
symptoms. It can be used as a pacemaker alone
(CRT-P) or combined with an ICD (CRT-D).
Broadly, CRT is recommended in patients with
LVEF ≤35% despite GDMT, who are in sinus
rhythm, with a left bundle branch block (LBBB)
and QRS ≥150 ms.[7] [9] [235] CRT should also
be considered in those with LBBB and QRS
≥120-149 ms or those with a non-LBBB pattern
and QRS ≥150 ms. Again, specific indications
vary in different countries, and guidelines should
be consulted for full details.

may be required. Some drugs may also be
contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.
Check your local drug information source for
more information. Initiation of GDMT for HF
with an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist, ARNi, or SGLT2 inhibitor may result
in an initial rise in serum creatinine and a drop in
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), but
this change is generally transient and should not
necessarily be a reason for discontinuation.[9]
[248]
» An increase in serum creatinine of <50%
above baseline, up to 3 mg/dL, or a decrease in
eGFR of <10% from baseline, as long as eGFR
is >25 mL/minute/1.73 m², may be considered
as acceptable. If the serum creatinine increases
to >3 mg/dL, the renal insufficiency can severely
limit the efficacy and enhance the toxicity of
established treatments.[249] [250]
» Aldosterone antagonists should be used with
caution in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia.
US guidelines advise that they are only initiated
in patients with eGFR >30 mL/minute/1.73 m²
and serum potassium <5.0 mEq/L.[7]

1st referral to specialist care for advanced HF
therapies
» Patients with indicators of advanced HF
require timely referral to specialist care to assess
suitability for management options that may
include inotropic support, mechanical circulatory
support (MCS), cardiac transplantation, and
palliative care.[7] [9]
» Inotropic support: in patients with advanced HF
refractory to optimal medical and device therapy,
prolonged intravenous inotropic support may
be used as a bridge to long-term mechanical
circulatory support or cardiac transplant.[7]
Continuous intravenous inotropic support may
also be considered as palliative therapy for the
relief of symptoms in patients without other
treatment options.[7] [9]
» MCS: helps to maintain sufficient end organ
perfusion by unloading the heart. Temporary
MCS, such as percutaneous and extracorporeal
ventricular assist devices, may be used in
patients with advanced HF and hemodynamic
compromise or shock as a bridge to recovery
or bridge to decision about future care.[7]
[9] Long-term MCS, such as a durable left
ventricular assist device (LVAD), is considered
in carefully selected patients who have end-
stage HF despite optimal medical and device
therapy, or dependence on intravenous
inotropes or temporary MCS, either as a bridge
to transplantation or as destination therapy
(permanent pump implantation in patients not
eligible for cardiac transplantation).[7] [9][238]

Emerging
Furosemide (subcutaneous)
A subcutaneous formulation of furosemide has been approved in the US for the treatment of congestion due
to fluid overload in adults with NYHA class II/III chronic heart failure. It is self-administered by the patient at
home. It is available as a preprogrammed on-body infusor with a prefilled cartridge, and is not recommended
for chronic use or use in emergency situations.
Sotagliflozin
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of both sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-1 and SGLT2. The Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved sotagliflozin to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death,
hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits in adults with heart failure across the full
range of left ventricular ejection fraction, or in adults with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and other
cardiovascular risk factors.
Novel implantable devices
Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) delivers non-excitatory electrical stimulation to the ventricle during the
absolute refractory period to enhance contractile performance without activating extra systolic contractions.
CCM works via key calcium regulatory pathways that increase cardiac contractility.[261] The Optimizer Smart
system is an implantable pulse generator that delivers CCM therapy and has been approved by the FDA for
the treatment of patients with chronic, moderate-to-severe HF who are not suited for treatment with other HF
devices such as cardiac resynchronization therapy to restore a normal timing pattern of the heartbeat. The
Barostim Neo System is an implantable device that delivers baroreflex activation therapy (BAT); it has been
approved by the FDA for the improvement of symptoms in patients with advanced HF who are not suited for
treatment with other HF devices, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Systematic reviews and
meta-analysis have found that BAT improves exercise capacity, NYHA class, and quality of life in patients
with HFrEF receiving guideline-directed medical therapy.[262] [263] Conduction system pacing (His-bundle
and left bundle branch area pacing) is an emerging alternative for CRT. In one meta-analysis, conduction
system pacing was found to be a feasible and effective alternative to biventricular pacing for CRT; further
trials are needed.[264]
Stem-cell therapy
Some trials of stem-cell therapy in both ischemic and nonischemic HF have shown some potential
benefit.[265] [266] A systematic review on the use of stem-cell therapy for chronic ischemic heart disease
and congestive HF suggests that at both short- and long-term follow-up (≥12 months) the use of autologous
bone marrow stem-cell treatment reduces all-cause mortality, although the quality of evidence is low.[267]
Gene therapy
An attractive strategy for treatment of HF is by gene therapy.[268] In a small randomized study of patients
(n=56) with HF and LVEF <40%, intracoronary delivery of adenovirus 5 encoding adenylyl cyclase 6
(Ad5.hAC6) increased the LVEF at 4 weeks, with no increase in exercise duration.[269] In a larger double-
blind placebo-controlled study (n=250), intracoronary infusion of 1 x 1013 DNase-resistant particle of adeno-
associated virus 1 (AAV1)/sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca2-ATPase (SERCA2a) did not improve the
clinical course of patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤35%).[270]
Surgical strategies
There have been numerous reports of alternate surgical approaches for the treatment of end-stage HF.[271]
Mitral valve repair or replacement has been shown to improve clinical status in patients who have a clinically
important degree of mitral regurgitation that is secondary to left ventricular dilation.[272] However, no

controlled studies have evaluated the effects of this procedure on ventricular function, rehospitalizations, or
survival. One single-center study designed to assess the effects of mitral valve annuloplasty on mortality
in patients with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction failed to demonstrate any
clear survival benefit.[273] A variant of the aneurysmectomy procedure is now being developed for the
management of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, but its role in the management of HF remains to be
defined.[274] None of the current surgical reconstruction techniques offer "rescue therapy" to patients with
critical hemodynamic compromise.
Omecamtiv mecarbil
Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel selective cardiac myosin activator (myotrope). In the GALACTIC-HF
phase 3 randomized controlled trial, patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who
received omecamtiv mecarbil had a lower incidence of a composite of a heart-failure event or death from
cardiovascular causes than those who received placebo, including those with low systolic blood pressure
(≤100 mmHg); however, there was no difference in all-cause mortality.[275] In a prespecified subgroup
analysis of GALACTIC-HF, omecamtiv mecarbil was shown to produce a greater therapeutic benefit
as baseline ejection fraction decreased.[276] A post-hoc analysis of GALACTIC-HF found that patients
with severe HF (defined as patients with New York Heart Association [NYHA] symptom class III to IV,
left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤30%, and hospitalization for HF within the previous 6 months)
benefited from treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil for the primary end point of time to first HF event or
death from cardiovascular causes, whereas patients without severe HF experienced no significant treatment
benefit.[277] The study found omecamtiv mecarbil was well tolerated with no significant changes in blood
pressure, kidney function, or potassium level, compared with placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) granted Fast Track designation for its development as a potential treatment of chronic HFrEF;
however, in December 2022, the FDA voted against approval, noting that the overall treatment effect in the
GALACTIC-HF trial was small, and none of the secondary end points were met. In 2023, the application for
approval was rejected with a request for more data. An application for marketing authorization in Europe has
also been withdrawn.
Primary prevention
Primary prevention is important for those at risk for HF (stage A) and for those with pre-HF (stage B).[7]
HF is the final pathway for a wide array of pathophysiologic processes. Interventions that reduce the risk
of development of any cardiovascular disease will ultimately reduce the incidence of HF.[95] [96] Thus, key
public health targets are prevention of development of underlying causes and comorbidities: hypertension,
diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity (i.e., metabolic syndrome), and ischemic heart disease.
• Lifestyle modifications, such as increasing physical activity, reducing tobacco, alcohol, and recreational
drug use, and reducing daily salt intake, and proper medical treatment of established diseases such as
hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, are expected to help reduce incident HF.[7] [95]
[96] [97] [98] 
• The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults at increased risk of cardiovascular
disease are offered behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity;
those not at high risk may also be considered for behavioral counseling interventions.[99] [100]
The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines
recommend additional measures for those with pre-HF (stage B) to prevent or delay progression to
symptomatic HF. Patients with pre-HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% should receive ACE
inhibitors and beta-blockers; angiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be used if the patient is intolerant to
ACE inhibitors and has had a recent myocardial infarction (MI).[7] Drugs that can cause or potentiate heart
failure should be avoided, if possible. In patients with LVEF <50%, thiazolidinediones and nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil) are not recommended. Thiazolidinediones increase
the risk of heart failure, including hospitalizations; negative inotropic effects of nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers may be harmful.[7]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of heart failure taken from
the AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.[7]

For those with a recent MI and LVEF ≤40% who
are intolerant to an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin-
II receptor antagonist is recommended as an
alternative to an ACE inhibitor.
Prevention of symptomatic heart failure and
mortality
ACE inhibitor: prevent symptomatic heart failure and
reduce mortality.
Angiotensin-II receptor antagonist: prevent
symptomatic heart failure and reduce mortality.
Beta-blocker: prevent symptomatic heart failure,
and reduce mortality (in those with a history of MI or
ACS).
>40 days post-MI, with LVEF ≤30%; with reasonable chance of survival >1 year
Intervention Goal
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI,
and who have a LVEF ≤30% and New York
Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms
while receiving guideline-directed medical
therapy and have a reasonable expectation of
meaningful survival for greater than a year, an ICD
is recommended.
Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death
(SCD) to reduce total mortality
Secondary prevention
Risk factor modification is the key to preventing or delaying the onset of overt clinical heart failure. Physicians
are advised to:
• Monitor blood pressure as closely as necessary to meet targets based on guidelines. The American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend a target of <130/80 mmHg
for patients with HFrEF, avoiding the use of nitrates.[330]
• Monitor volume status (daily weights and adjustment of diuretic dose as necessary).
• Pursue revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease, when appropriate; aggressive
medical management of ischemia is advised.
• Maintain adequate rate control in patients with tachyarrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation); if there is
difficulty in achieving rate control or there is substantial symptom burden from the arrhythmia, rhythm
control, and maintenance of sinus rhythm should be considered. Anticoagulation should be considered
in all patients with atrial fibrillation (based on validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc)
unless contraindicated. Very aggressive rate control (especially with beta blockers) should be avoided,
as patients may have significant LA dysfunction with low stroke volume and inability to increase stroke
volume during exercise.
• Use sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor for management of hyperglycemia in patients
with diabetes.[278]
• Optimize HF therapies in patients with chronic kidney disease.[278]
• Treat obstructive sleep apnea if present.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Management
MANAGEMENT
• Promote weight loss in overweight patients. Surgically induced weight loss may be considered in
patients with class III obesity (BMI 40 or above).
• Encourage tobacco and alcohol discontinuation.
• Encourage regular aerobic exercise and consider cardiac rehabilitation when appropriate.
Patient discussions
Patients should be advised to:
• Monitor weight daily (for volume status)
• Manage weight through diet and regular, symptom-limited exercise
• Restrict sodium and fluid when necessary
• Discontinue tobacco and alcohol
• Participate in regular exercise if able, and enrol in a cardiac rehabilitation program.[7] [9]
• Have vaccinations against respiratory infections, such as influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal
disease, and respiratory syncytial virus (patients ages 60 years and older).[7] [329]
• Manage comorbidities:[278]
• Control of hypertension and diabetes (e.g., provide patients with blood pressure and HbA1c
goal)
• Management of lipids (e.g., provide leaflets and show website links for diet, exercise, and
healthy lifestyle)

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients benefit from frequent formal evaluation in a specialized center or monitoring in a management
program.[7] Assessment should be made at each visit of the ability of a patient to perform routine and
desired activities of daily living. Assessment should also be made of the fluid status and weight of
the patient. Careful history of current use of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, alternative therapies, and
chemotherapy drugs, as well as diet and sodium intake, should be obtained at each visit.[316] Repeat
measurement of ejection fraction and assessment of the severity of structural remodeling can provide
useful information in patients with HF who have had a change in clinical status, or who have experienced
or recovered from a clinical event, or received treatment that might have had a significant effect on
cardiac function. The value of serial measurements of B-type natriuretic peptide to guide therapy for
patients is still not well established. Data suggest that natriuretic-guided therapy reduces hospitalization
due to HF and that in patients younger than 75 years of age, it also provides a survival benefit.[317]
However, one randomized trial found that in high-risk patients with HF, natriuretic-guided therapy was not
more effective than optimal medical therapy alone in improving outcomes.[318]
Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurement of >40% on follow-up after
treatment are considered to have HF with improved EF (HFimpEF). These patients should continue with
guideline-directed medical therapy to prevent relapse of HF and LV dysfunction.[7] [9]
Validated questionnaires, such as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, may be used to
assess the patient's perception of their health status and can be useful to provide incremental information
for patient functional status, symptom burden, and prognosis.[7] [319]
The use of telemonitoring to monitor patients remotely is an emerging strategy that has been shown to
reduce the risk of mortality and HF-related hospitalizations, but requires further evaluation.[320] [321]
[322] [323] [Evidence A]
Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is not routinely used in clinical practice, but may be of use in individual
patients, particularly those with recurrent HF hospitalization.[324][325][326][327][328]

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
pleural effusion long term high
Pleural effusions are a common complication of chronic congestive HF.
cardiorenal syndrome long term medium
A common reason for refractory symptoms is the cardiorenal syndrome, a spectrum of disorders involving
the heart and kidneys in which acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic
dysfunction in the other organ.[303] These patients show an impaired response to diuretics and ACE
inhibitors and are at increased risk of adverse effects during treatment with digoxin.[249] [304] [305]
 Persistent or progressive renal functional impairment has been associated with a poor prognosis.[306]
[307] The symptoms of HF in patients with end-stage renal disease may be exacerbated by an increase in
loading conditions produced both by anemia and by fistulas implanted to permit dialysis.[308]
See Management approach  for more information on chronic kidney disease and HF.
anemia long term medium
Patients with HF frequently have comorbid anemia for a variety of reasons, which may worsen HF
symptoms. Several studies have demonstrated worse outcomes in patients with HF and anemia, such
as a 1.027 higher risk for mortality associated with a 1% lower hematocrit, after adjustment for other
factors.[309] [310] It is unclear whether anemia is the cause of decreased survival or a marker of more
severe disease. Several small studies have suggested benefit from use of erythropoietin and iron for
treatment of mild anemia in HF, although at the cost of increased risk of thromboembolic events.[311] [312]
[313] However, a larger study showed no clinical benefit of darbepoietin alfa treatment.[314]
acute decompensation of chronic heart failure variable high
Despite optimal treatment, many precipitating factors or even new events may cause acute
decompensation of a previously stable patient, thus leading to pulmonary edema (backward failure) or
cardiogenic shock (forward failure). Common causes include myocardial infarction and its mechanical
complications (papillary muscle rupture with new-onset acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect,
and ventricular rupture), arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, infection, anemia, tamponade, myocarditis,
acute renal failure or even increased salt intake, inappropriate drug therapy, or patient noncompliance.
Patients with acute decompensation require urgent hemodynamic stabilization and diagnosis of the
precipitating cause. Pharmacologic therapy includes intravenous diuretics, intravenous positive inotropic
agents, intravenous vasodilators, and intravenous vasopressors. Nonpharmacologic treatment modalities
will be necessary: these include oxygenation, balloon counterpulsation, pacing, urgent catheterization or
urgent cardiac surgery, or mechanical support with ventricular assist devices.
acute kidney injury variable high
Patients have a high risk of developing acute renal insufficiency at any point of their clinical course as
a result of either poor renal perfusion (low cardiac output state) or drug overuse to treat HF (diuretics,
ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists). In addition, the use of
carvedilol requires close monitoring of the renal function as it could contribute, with other agents, to the

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
development of acute renal injury. Inability to maintain adequate renal perfusion on oral therapy may
eventually necessitate intravenous inotropic infusion or urgent ultrafiltration and hemodialysis.
sudden cardiac death variable medium
Sudden cardiac death is common in HF patients and accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of
the deaths among these patients. It can be the consequence of both ventricular fibrillation and
electromechanical dissociation, and can occur any time in the course of the disease, even at the
asymptomatic patient.
In patients who survive an episode of cardiac arrest, prophylactic insertion of an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator and initiation of appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy is indicated.
hyperkalemia variable medium
Patients with heart failure have several factors that may put them at a high risk of hyperkalemia; these
include factors that are directly related to the condition (i.e., impaired delivery of sodium and water to
the distal renal tubule), associated comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, CKD), and use of drugs that cause
hyperkalemia.[7]
Use of patiromer, a novel potassium-binder, to manage serum potassium levels and allow target doses of
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use (particularly aldosterone antagonists) in patients with
HFrEF is being investigated.[315]
Prognosis
The evaluation of a patient would be incomplete without an initial and periodic assessment of short- and
long-term prognosis. However, the likelihood of survival can be determined reliably only in populations and
not in individual patients. Numerous factors have been used as prognostic indicators including demographics
(age, sex, race), symptoms (New York Heart Association classification), comorbidities (hypertension,
diabetes, cachexia, anemia, and renal and hepatic dysfunction), and objective clinical parameters (e.g.,
ejection fraction, left ventricular size, volume, mass and shape, exercise capacity, and serum levels of
sodium, norepinephrine, renin, B-type natriuretic peptide, uric acid, angiotensin II, aldosterone, tumor
necrosis factor-alfa, endothelin). Multivariate analysis of these variables has helped to identify the most
significant predictors of survival, and prognostic models have been developed and validated.[292] [293]
[294] [295] [296] [297] [298] [299] However, all existing models to predict the risk of death or need for
urgent transplantation have features that may limit their applicability. Hemoglobin A1c was also found to
be an independent progressive risk factor for cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and mortality, even in
nondiabetic patients.[300]
The most comprehensive prognostic model is the Seattle Heart Failure Model.  [The Seattle Heart Failure
Model] (http://depts.washington.edu/shfm)  This model has been implemented as an interactive program
that employs the Seattle Heart Failure Score to estimate mean, 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival and the benefit of
adding medications and/or devices for an individual patient.[294]
Despite standard medical therapy the survival for patients with end-stage HF is poor.
Despite optimal medical therapy including cardiac resynchronization therapy, only 65% of patients in NYHA
class 4 are alive at a mean follow-up of 17 months.[301]

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Follow up
FOLLOW UP
The 5-year survival in patients with stage D HF is only 20%.[302]
One study looking at comorbidities in two large cohorts of patients (one from 2002 and one from 2017) found
that in the earlier cohort, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and CKD were independent predictors
for adverse outcome (HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality during a total follow-up of 1.5 years), and
atrial fibrillation/flutter showed a non-significant trend towards poor outcome. In the later 2017 cohort, the
independent predictors were anemia, obesity and COPD, with CKD showing a trend towards poor outcome.
Other chronic conditions included in the model were not independently associated with prognosis, however
an overall higher comorbidity burden was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization or all-cause
mortality.[8]

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
