Acute heart failure Overview
Summary
Acute heart failure is a clinical syndrome of reduced cardiac output, tissue hypoperfusion, increased
pulmonary pressure, and tissue congestion.
Presents with dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, swelling of the legs, fatigue, and generalized
weakness.
Clinical diagnosis is supported by ancillary tests such as ECG, chest x-ray, B-type natriuretic peptide, and
echocardiogram. In cases where echocardiographic images are suboptimal or when an unusual cause
of heart failure is suspected, and for diagnosis of specific cardiomyopathies, other tests (e.g., cardiac
catheterization with hemodynamic measurements, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging) are used.
Diuretics, oxygen, and vasodilators are initial treatments for symptom relief. Cardiogenic shock may require
vasoactive agents, mechanical ventilation, or mechanical circulatory support.
If acute myocardial infarction is present, early revascularization is essential.
Underlying cause or precipitant should be identified and treated.
Definition
Heart failure is defined clinically as a syndrome in which patients have symptoms and signs resulting from
an abnormality of cardiac structure and/or function causing impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of
blood.[1] [2] Acute heart failure refers to rapid onset or worsening of symptoms and/or signs of heart failure,
requiring urgent evaluation and treatment.[1]

Acute heart failure Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Heart failure is the most common indication for hospitalization for a circulatory condition in the US, and the
second most common cause of hospitalization overall among patients >65 years.[4]
From 2017 to 2020, approximately 6.7 million adults ages ≥20 years had heart failure in the US.[5] The
prevalence of heart failure increases with increasing age. In the US, among people ages 40 to 59 years, the
prevalence of heart failure is about 2.3% in males and 1.2% in females, whereas among people ages ≥80
years the prevalence of heart failure is about 10.9% in males and 7.1% in females; however, the population
attributable risk of modifiable risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and smoking is greater
among young (ages <55 years) compared with older (ages ≥75 years) individuals.[6] [5] Women present
with heart failure later in life and survival is generally more favorable; however, they present with more
comorbidities and with lower patient-reported health status than men.[2] In the US, heart failure incidence is
higher in black patients compared to white patients, and rates of heart failure hospitalization and mortality are
also higher.[2]
Heart failure is a global disease. The prevalence of heart disease is about 1.3% in China, 6.7% in Malaysia,
1% in Japan, 4.5% in Singapore, 0.12% to 0.44% in India, 1% in South America, and 1% to 2% in
Australia.[7] Global improvements in AHF survival between 1980 and 2017 have been linked to increased
use of neurohormonal antagonist drugs (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors).[8]
Risk factors
Strong
older age
Prevalence of heart failure is ≥10% in people ≥70 years of age.[1] [11]
prior episode of heart failure
In patients hospitalized for acute heart failure, around 75% have a history of prior heart failure.[11]
coronary artery disease
Coronary artery disease accounts for around 50% of all patients with acute heart failure.[11] [12]
[13] [14] Chronic myocardial ischemia results in myocardial damage with progressive decline in left
ventricular (LV) systolic function. Subendocardial ischemia also causes an increase in LV end diastolic
pressure leading to pulmonary edema in the presence of normal LV systolic function. 
Acute coronary ischemia can lead to acute heart failure either due to pump failure or papillary muscle
destruction/rupture. In the case of pump failure, the LV function is depressed, but in cases of heart
failure associated with papillary muscle rupture, the measured LV function may appear preserved.
hypertension
A history of hypertension is present in 72% of patients in the US and 60% of patients in Europe.[11]
[13] [14]
Hypertension predisposes to the development of heart failure by increasing the afterload on the
ventricles, which induces left ventricular hypertrophy, which in turn leads to left ventricular (LV)
dysfunction, an increased risk of myocardial infarction, and significant arrhythmias.

Acute heart failure Theory
In patients with noncompliant ventricles, an abrupt or significant increase in blood pressure increases
the LV end diastolic pressure, precipitating acute heart failure.
valvular heart disease
About 23% of patients in the US and 34% in Europe have valvular disease as an associated
condition.[11] [14] Both significant stenotic and regurgitant lesions can lead to heart failure.
Although rheumatic valvular disease is now rarely found in western countries, calcific valvular heart
disease, in particular aortic stenosis, is commonly encountered.
In patients with significant valvular disease, the heart failure will not improve until the underlying
valvular disease has been corrected.
pericardial disease
A large pericardial effusion can present with symptoms or signs of acute heart failure.
Pericardial constriction, such as tuberculosis pericarditis or the effects of radiation therapy, can also
present with acute heart failure.
myocarditis
There are many causes of myocarditis, of which a viral etiology appears to be the most common.
There is usually a prodrome of a nonspecific illness characterized by fatigue, mild dyspnea, and
myalgias.
cardiac arrhythmias
Cardiac arrhythmias, including tachyarrhythmia and bradyarrhythmia, are risk factors for acute heart
failure. Atrial fibrillation is present in approximately 35% of cases.[15] Concomitant atrial fibrillation and
heart failure predicts increased all-cause mortality across all categories of heart failure.[16]
atrial fibrillation
Present in 31% of cases.[11]
diabetes mellitus
Related directly to ischemia and renal failure.
nonadherence to medications
Precipitating factor in patients with acute on chronic heart failure.
Weak
excessive salt intake
Present in 22% of cases.[17]
excessive catecholamine stimulation
Can be caused by pheochromocytoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or methamphetamine misuse.[18]

abnormal thyroid function
Both hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can be associated with heart failure.[20] [21]
excessive alcohol intake
Excessive alcohol intake is associated with heart failure.[22] [23]
obesity
Obesity is a risk factor for hypertension and coronary artery disease, and is also associated with
increased risk of heart failure. However, there is evidence that patients with heart failure and obesity
have better clinical outcomes compared to patients with normal weight and similar degrees of heart
failure (the “obesity paradox”).[24]
Studies show that higher body mass index is more strongly associated with the risk of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) than with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).[25]
[26]
Etiology
Causes and precipitating factors in acute heart failure are:
• Decompensation of pre-existing chronic heart failure
• Acute coronary syndrome
• Hypertensive crisis
• Acute arrhythmia
• Severe valvular regurgitation
• Severe aortic or mitral valve stenosis
• Acute severe myocarditis
• Cardiac tamponade
• Aortic dissection
• Postpartum cardiomyopathy
• Lack of adherence to medical treatment
• Volume overload
• Infections
• Severe brain insult
• After major surgery
• Reduction of renal function
• Drug abuse
• Pheochromocytoma
• High output syndromes
• Septicemia
• Thyrotoxic crisis
• Anemia
• Shunt syndromes.
The most common concurrent conditions present in patients with acute heart failure are coronary artery
disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and renal insufficiency.[1][9]

Acute heart failure Theory
Pathophysiology
During an episode of acute heart failure, the majority of patients will have evidence of volume overload with
pulmonary and/or venous congestion. Hemodynamic measurements in these cases usually show increased
right- and left-sided ventricular filling pressures with depressed cardiac index and cardiac output. However, if
there is associated infection, the cardiac output may be normal or, in some cases, increased.
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes tachycardia, increased myocardial contractility,
increased myocardial oxygen consumption, peripheral vasoconstriction, and activation of renin-angiotensin
system with salt and water retention. There is also activation of vasoconstrictor neurohormones, which leads
to sodium and fluid retention, increased myocardial wall stress, and decreased renal perfusion.[10]
If the condition is not treated effectively, the myocardium becomes unable to maintain a cardiac output
sufficient to meet the demands of the peripheral circulation. In order for patients with acute heart failure to
respond quickly to treatment, the increased myocardial stress must be reversed; for example, correction
of acute severe hypertension. This is particularly important in acute heart failure caused by ischemia, as a
dysfunctional myocardium can return to normal when appropriately treated.
Classification
Clinical presentations
Patients with acute heart failure may present with a spectrum of conditions ranging from gradually
progressive dyspnea to acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Broadly, they can be subclassified
into groups according to the principal cause leading to acute heart failure (e.g., patients with acute coronary
syndrome, accelerated hypertension, rapid arrhythmias or heart block, acute mechanical cause, valvular
dysfunction, acute right heart failure due to massive pulmonary embolism, and acute on chronic heart
failure).
The European Society of Cardiology describes four major clinical presentations, with possible overlaps
between them:[1]
1. Acute decompensated heart failure
2. Acute pulmonary edema
3. Isolated right ventricular failure
4. Cardiogenic shock.
Clinical classification of acute heart failure[3]
For simplification these patients can be classified into three main groups:
1. Hypertensive acute heart failure (acute de novo heart failure or vascular failure)
• Symptoms develop rapidly against a background of hypertension with increased sympathetic tone and
neurohormonal activations.
• Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is usually preserved and there are clinical and radiologic
findings of pulmonary congestion, usually without signs of systemic congestion; for example,
peripheral edema.

Acute heart failure Theory
THEORY
• Response to therapy is rapid.
2. Normotensive acute heart failure (acutely decompensated chronic heart failure)
• History of progressive worsening of chronic heart failure.
• BP is usually normal and symptoms and signs develop gradually with both systemic and pulmonary
congestion.
• LVEF is usually reduced.
3. Hypotensive acute heart failure
• Presents with symptoms and signs of hypotension, organ hypoperfusion, and cardiogenic shock.
Types of heart failure
Traditionally heart failure is classified as:
• Systolic - associated with LV dysfunction and characterized by cardiomegaly, third heart sound, and
volume overload with pulmonary congestion. LVEF is decreased
• Diastolic - typically associated with normal cardiac size, hypertension, pulmonary congestion, and a
fourth heart sound. LVEF is preserved.
Based on measurement of LVEF, heart failure is classified as:[1] [2]
• Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) - symptoms and signs and LVEF ≤40%
• A subgroup of HFrEF can be further classified as heart failure with improved ejection fraction
(HFimpEF) if a previous ejection fraction ≤40% has improved to >40% after follow-up
measurement.[2]
• Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) - symptoms and signs and LVEF 41% to
49%
• Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) - symptoms and signs and LVEF ≥50%.
• Evidence of structural heart disease may be used to further support the diagnosis of HFpEF.[2]
The criteria for diagnosis of HFmrEF and HFpEF require evidence of spontaneous (at rest) or provokable
(e.g., during exercise, fluid challenge) increased LV filling pressures.[1] [2] This may be fulfilled by elevated
natriuretic peptides, noninvasive measures (e.g., echocardiographic diastolic parameters), or by invasive
hemodynamic measurement.[2]

Acute heart failure Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Recommendations
Key Recommendations
Despite advances in technology, diagnosis is primarily clinically based, supported by ancillary tests such
as ECG, chest x-ray, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and echocardiogram.[1] [2] [32] The sensitivity
of clinical assessment in identifying left ventricular systolic dysfunction is approximately 81% but the
specificity is only 47%. The specificity of this diagnosis is improved to 69% by addition of ECG and to 92%
by addition of chest x-ray.[33] Point-of-care lung ultrasound may be used as an alternative to chest x-ray
in the emergency setting in conjunction with medical history and physical exam.[34][35]
Other tests (e.g., cardiac catheterization with hemodynamic measurements, computed tomography
[CT], and cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging) can be used when noninvasive tests and
echocardiographic images are suboptimal or when an unusual cause of heart failure is suspected, and for
diagnosis of specific cardiomyopathies.[1] [36]
History and risk factors
A careful history should be taken for causes of acute heart failure, such as myocardial ischemia,
uncontrolled hypertension, significant valvular disease (both stenosis and regurgitation, or endocarditis),
atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias, infection, anemia, hyper- or hypothyroidism, pulmonary embolism,
and precipitating factors causing exacerbation of chronic heart failure such as dietary indiscretion with
excessive salt intake, nonadherence to medication regimen, use of medications with negative inotropic
effect (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) or medications that promote sodium retention, and excessive alcohol or
drug intake.[2] A clinical scoring system is sometimes useful for the diagnosis of acute heart failure.[36]
Symptoms
Heart failure presents with dyspnea (including orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), cough,
decreased exercise tolerance, leg edema, fatigue, and generalized weakness. Sometimes the patient
may present with predominant symptoms of the underlying condition, such as chest pain, syncope,
palpitations, or viral prodrome.
Signs
Common signs include central cyanosis, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, displaced apex
beat, third heart sound (S3), crepitations or pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, ascites, edema, and cool
peripheries. The presence of these signs depends upon the duration, acuity, and the underlying cause of
heart failure.[37] Patients with end-stage heart failure may exhibit most of these clinical signs, whereas
those in the early phase of the illness may have minimal signs.
Patients with advanced heart failure can be classified clinically into four hemodynamic profiles.[38] These
profiles, which are based on hemodynamic principles of presence or absence of elevated filling pressure
(wet or dry) and perfusion that is adequate or critically limited (warm or cold), include:[1]
• Warm and dry
• Warm and wet
• Cold and dry
• Cold and wet.
Patients with pulmonary edema present with severe respiratory distress with reduced oxygen saturation
(usually <90% on room air) and crackles or wheezes on lung exam (“wet”) but may or may not be
hemodynamically compromised (“cold” or “warm”). Patients with hemodynamic compromise, systolic
BP less than 90 mmHg, or a drop of mean arterial pressure of more than 30 mmHg with a pulse rate
over 60 bpm and/or low urine output (<0.5 ml/kg/hour), with or without evidence of organ congestion,

are considered to be in cardiogenic shock (“cold”) but may or may not present with concomitant acute
pulmonary edema (“wet” or “dry”).
Immediate investigations
An ECG and chest x-ray should be performed immediately in all patients with suspected acute heart
failure.[2] ECG findings are commonly related to the underlying pathologies and include presence of Q
waves, ST-T changes, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation. ECG
abnormality is found in almost all cases of heart failure. If the ECG is completely normal then alternate
diagnosis should be considered.[39]

Chest x-ray may show cardiac enlargement (cardiothoracic ratio [CTR] >50%); however, there is poor
correlation between the CTR and presence of heart failure, as the heart size may be normal in patients
with diastolic dysfunction, acute valvular regurgitation as part of infective endocarditis, or acute myocardial
infarction. An enlarged CTR may also be seen in the absence of heart failure (e.g., pericardial effusion
and LVH).
In most cases, evaluation of the lung fields will show signs of pulmonary congestion, initially in the upper
zones, then in the horizontal fissures, followed by pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.

The radiologic findings have to be taken in the context of the clinical picture, as pulmonary infiltrates
and congestion, in some cases, may be due to noncardiac causes such as acute respiratory distress
syndrome or alveolar hemorrhage.
Chest x-rays rarely may show pericardial calcification, prosthetic valves, or valvular calcification. Such
findings may be helpful in identifying the possible underlying etiology for heart failure.
Point-of-care lung ultrasound may be used as an alternative to chest x-ray when the equipment is
available and clinicians are proficient in its use, alongside medical history and physical exam.[34] [40]
The following blood tests should be requested when patients present with suspected acute heart
failure:[2]
• Hemoglobin: may identify anemia as a contributing factor.
• Thyroid function tests: both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause heart failure.

Acute heart failure Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP): measurement of serum BNP level in patients with symptoms
of heart failure is useful to support or exclude the diagnosis, and is recommended for patients
hospitalized with heart failure to establish prognosis.[2] The addition of BNP or N-terminal pro-
BNP (NT-proBNP) to clinical assessment significantly enhances the accuracy of diagnosis and
effectiveness of acute management.[41] [42] BNP is also helpful in differentiating a cardiac from a
pulmonary cause of dyspnea.[43] A BNP >500 picograms/mL in a patient with dyspnea points to
heart failure as the likely cause, whereas a BNP <100 picograms/mL makes heart failure unlikely.
An elevated BNP level is a predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with acute decompensated
heart failure.[44] However, an elevated BNP level should only be taken in the context of the clinical
picture as it may be increased in a variety of other conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
embolism, or sepsis.[45] In patients presenting with suspected acute heart failure, a finding of
BNP <100 picograms/mL, NT-proBNP <300 picograms/mL, and mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic
peptide (MR-proANP) <120 picograms/mL makes the diagnosis of acute heart failure unlikely.[1]
Diagnostic accuracy can be improved by combining NT-proBNP assessment with other clinical
variables using a validated clinical decision support tool.  [CODE-HF tool]  [46]
• Cardiac enzymes: >50% of patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (but without evidence for
myocardial infarction) have elevated troponin T levels.[1] [47] Elevated troponin T levels in patients
with acute heart failure may reflect subendocardial ischemia due to elevated left ventricular end
diastolic pressure. In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a troponin T level ≥0.1
micrograms/L (≥0.1 ng/mL) is a powerful independent predictor and is associated with poor long-
term survival.[47] One systematic review and meta-analysis showed a strong association between
high sensitive cardiac troponin and the development of incident heart failure.[48]
• Other recommended initial baseline blood tests include serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen,
serum creatinine, glucose, lipid profile, liver function tests (including albumin), and iron studies.[1]
[2] [49]
Echocardiogram is an integral part of the evaluation in a patient with acute heart failure and should be
performed as soon as possible to presentation.[2] It is required to assess chamber size, ventricular
function (systolic and diastolic), ventricular wall thickness, valvular function, and the pericardium.

Subsequent investigations
Left heart cardiac catheterization (coronary angiogram) is needed in cases where significant coronary
artery disease is thought to be a contributing factor.[2] Routine use of right heart catheterization and
pulmonary artery catheter monitoring is not recommended. However, invasive hemodynamic evaluation or
monitoring is helpful if:[2]
• Systolic blood pressure (SBP) remains low or symptoms persist despite treatment
• Fluid status, perfusion, or systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance is uncertain
• Renal function worsens with therapy
• Parenteral vasoactive agents are required.
A cardiac CT coronary angiogram is a noninvasive technique to visualize the coronary anatomy in
patients with heart failure with low to intermediate pre-test probability of coronary artery disease or those
with equivocal noninvasive stress tests, in order to exclude the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
Endomyocardial biopsy is not recommended for routine evaluation of acute heart failure, but is indicated
in patients with rapidly progressive clinical heart failure or worsening ventricular dysfunction that persists
despite appropriate medical treatment, where clinical findings suggest acute myocarditis, or where a
myocardial infiltrative process (e.g., light chain amyloidosis) or cardiac rejection after heart transplantation
is suspected.[2]
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be used when noninvasive tests and
echocardiographic images are suboptimal or when an unusual cause of heart failure is suspected, and for
diagnosis of specific cardiomyopathies.[1] [2] [36]
Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) may be useful in assessing
ischemia and myocardial viability. 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy may
be useful for the detection of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.[1] [2]

Acute heart failure Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Measuring the concentration of certain biomarkers can provide important information about disease
severity and helps not only in the detection and diagnosis of heart failure but also in management and
prognosis. In addition to natriuretic peptides and troponin, useful biomarkers include soluble suppressor
of tumorigenicity 2, interleukin-6, cystatin-C, galectin-3, and procalcitonin.[50]

Acute heart failure Management
Recommendations
Key Recommendations
Initial management options include a combination of oxygen, diuretics, vasodilators, inotropes, and
vasopressors.[1] [2] Other possible therapies include extracorporeal ultrafiltration; ventilation (noninvasive
and endotracheal intubation); and mechanical circulatory support (e.g., intra-aortic balloon pump,
ventricular assist devices).[1]
Evidence supporting the use of intravenous morphine to treat dyspnea is lacking and data suggest there
might be adverse effects.[64] [65] Hence the current recommendation is that morphine should not be
used routinely in patients with acute heart failure.[36] Morphine can be used for palliative care, and is
helpful in individual patients because of its venodilator properties and because it decreases sympathetic
drive; however, it should be used cautiously as it can cause respiratory depression, potentially increasing
the chance of mechanical ventilation.
All patients should be admitted to the hospital. If the patient responds adequately to initial treatment
and meets strict selection criteria, telemetry monitoring may be acceptable (e.g., hospital-at-home
program).[66] Those who are hypotensive or fail to respond to initial therapy require admission to
the intensive care unit and may need invasive monitoring if tissue perfusion is compromised.[67] If
cardiogenic shock is present, invasive evaluation is required.
Patients with acute heart failure should undergo evaluation for potential precipitating factors, including
myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias (commonly atrial fibrillation), underlying valvular disease, exacerbation
of hypertension, anemia, thyroid disorders, and drug interactions. Other concomitant conditions, such as
pneumonia and pulmonary embolism, may also be contributing factors.
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is recommended in all patients. See  Venous thromboembolism
(VTE) prophylaxis .
Patients with acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who are iron deficient should receive
intravenous iron supplementation to reduce the risk of future heart failure hospitalizations.[68] [69]
Maintenance of oxygen saturation
High-flow oxygen is recommended in patients with a capillary oxygen saturation <90% or PaO₂ <60
mmHg (8.0 kPa) to correct hypoxemia.[1]
Ventilation with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure may
be required if oxygen saturation cannot be maintained by oxygenation alone, and is associated with a
decreased requirement for intubation and mechanical ventilation.[1]
Mechanical ventilation is only used when other treatments, including noninvasive ventilation methods, fail.
Hemodynamically stable
Diuretics and vasodilators
• Loop diuretics are the mainstay of treatment for patients who are hemodynamically stable and
are effective in relieving symptoms.[1] [2] [73] Loop diuretics used for the treatment of acute heart
failure and congestion include furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide. The most commonly used

agent appears to be furosemide, but some patients may respond more favorably to another loop
diuretic.
• Intravenous diuretics (bolus or continuous infusion) are indicated on initial hospitalization in patients
with pulmonary congestion and volume overload.[1] [2] All patients with symptoms and signs of
congestion should receive diuretics, irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients
already taking oral loop diuretics should be started on a higher dose intravenously (may require
double their usual dose), with further titration as needed.[2] [66] Diuretic response should be
evaluated shortly after start of diuretic therapy, initially with hourly urine output measurement;
ongoing monitoring should include careful measurement of 24-hour fluid intake and output, vital
signs, and standing body weight measured at the same time each day.[1] [2]
• Nonloop diuretics may be added if there is an inadequate response to loop diuretics
alone.[2] Evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the use of acetazolamide and
hydrochlorothiazide as add-on diuretic therapy; other options include metolazone, or acute use of
aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone.[2] [74] [75]
• Acetazolamide added to loop diuretic therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart
failure results in a greater incidence of successful decongestion.[75]
• Hydrochlorothiazide with intravenous furosemide results in greater diuresis and weight loss
compared to furosemide alone, but with worsening renal function.[74]
• Careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is essential when loop and nonloop diuretics
are used in combination.[2] The minimum dose of diuretics should be used to relieve congestion,
keep the patient asymptomatic, and maintain a dry weight (defined as when the patient is
euvolemic).
• In patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, diuretics should be used only in
combination with other medical therapies, such as an ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor), a beta-blocker, and an
aldosterone antagonist.[2]
• In both acute heart failure and stable congestive heart failure, loop diuretics are the preferred agent
for most patients. However, a thiazide diuretic may be considered for patients with hypertension
and only mild fluid retention.[2] 
• Vasodilators (nitroglycerin, nitroprusside) are often used in acute heart failure to relieve symptoms
of pulmonary congestion in patients without systemic hypotension; however, they do not improve
long-term outcomes (i.e., reduction of mortality or rehospitalization).[1] [2] 
• Nitroglycerin is preferred in emergency settings.[34]
• Nitroprusside is usually given in the intensive care setting where enhanced monitoring is
available (e.g., invasive hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring), due to its potential for
marked hypotension and risk of cyanide toxicity.[2] 
In patients who do not respond to initial therapy, extracorporeal ultrafiltration is used to reduce volume
overload.[76] [77]

Acute heart failure Management
Hemodynamically unstable
Patients with hypotension (i.e., systolic blood pressure [BP] <90 mmHg) or shock should receive oxygen
therapy if capillary oxygen saturation <90% or PaO₂ <60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), vasoactive drugs, and
ventilation and mechanical circulatory support if needed.[1] 
Cardiogenic shock is characterized by critical reduction in cardiac output and end-organ hypoperfusion in
a patient with a systolic BP <90 mmHg.[2] 
Short-term intravenous infusion of a vasoactive agent (vasopressor and/or inotrope) should be considered
in patients with hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg) and/or signs or symptoms of hypoperfusion, despite
adequate filling status.[1] [2] Vasoactive agents may cause tachycardia, and induce arrhythmias and
myocardial ischemia.[1] [2] 
Vasopressor therapy aims to reverse the mismatch between vessel tone and intravascular volume by
inducing vasoconstriction. The preferred vasopressor is norepinephrine (noradrenaline).[1] [2] 
Inotropes (e.g., dobutamine, milrinone) can increase cardiac output and improve hemodynamics in
patients with cardiogenic shock.[2] Inotropes should be used with caution because there is evidence
that they result in increased mortality.[1] [2] [13] Inotropes should be discontinued if there are
sustained arrhythmias or symptomatic coronary ischemia. Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is
recommended during infusion of inotropes. There is a lack of robust evidence to suggest a clear benefit of
one inotropic agent over another in cardiogenic shock.[2] [78] 
Selection of appropriate vasoactive agents may vary according to clinician preference and local practice
guidelines. Consult a specialist for guidance on suitable regimens.
Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices (e.g., extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
or intra-aortic balloon pump) should be considered in patients with persistent cardiogenic shock despite
inotropic therapy.[1] [2] [79]
See Shock .
Specific treatment of underlying cause
Coronary artery disease
• Intravenous nitroglycerin is first-line treatment.
• The common adverse effect of nitroglycerin is headache and hypotension. The dose of nitrates
should be reduced if systolic BP decreases below 90 to 100 mmHg, and discontinued permanently
if BP drops further.
• In cases of significant coronary artery disease causing acute heart failure, percutaneous
revascularization or coronary artery bypass should be carried out. Aspirin, in combination with
a P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), is given to all patients with coronary
ischemia and those undergoing revascularization.[80]
• In the case of cardiogenic shock with acute myocardial infarction, revascularization is
recommended. Thrombolysis in this setting is not effective.[81]

Acute heart failure Management
MANAGEMENT
• Use of intravenous nitroglycerin is recommended.
• If additional medications are needed, nitroprusside is recommended in addition to other choices.
Nitroprusside should be given in a setting where enhanced monitoring is available (e.g., invasive
hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring).
• See Hypertensive emergencies .
Cardiac arrhythmias
• Either rapid arrhythmias or severe bradycardia/conduction disturbance can precipitate acute heart
failure.
• Patients presenting acutely with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter require anticoagulation, rate control,
and rhythm control when indicated (e.g., urgent DC cardioversion for patients with hemodynamic
instability).[82]
• Severe bradycardia may require temporary pacing or drug interventions; patients with non-
reversible causes may require an implantable pacemaker with or without a defibrillator.[83]
• See Evaluation of tachycardia and Bradycardia .
Valvular heart disease
• In cases of severe aortic stenosis with heart failure, nitroprusside can be used with careful
monitoring, provided the patient is not hypotensive.[1] [84]
• The definitive treatment for aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis is valve replacement, but in resistant
heart failure a percutaneous valvotomy may be used as temporary measure until definitive valve
replacement is carried out. In mitral stenosis, percutaneous valvuloplasty may be done if no
thrombus is present on transesophageal echocardiogram.
• Similarly in heart failure associated with mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation, a vasodilating
drug such as nitroprusside may be used.[2] A decrease in the peripheral arterial resistance
results in an increase in the cardiac output and a decrease in regurgitant volume, which, in turn,
is associated with a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and an augmentation of the
ejection fraction.
• See Aortic stenosis , Aortic regurgitation , Mitral stenosis , and Mitral regurgitation .
Acute right heart failure
• Therapy is centered around treatment of the underlying pathology; e.g., pulmonary embolism
(anticoagulation, thrombolytics, catheterization, or surgically directed thrombectomy), right
ventricular infarction (percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolytics), and chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (thromboendarterectomy).[85]
• See Pulmonary embolism .
Acute myocarditis
• Myocarditis caused by autoimmune disease (clinical or endomyocardial biopsy evidence of
autoimmune disease) including giant cell myocarditis is treated with single or combination
immunosuppressant therapy which may include corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine.[1]
[86]
• Treatment of other forms of myocarditis is limited to supportive care, alongside standard heart
failure therapy for at least 6 months.[1]

Acute heart failure Management
• See Myocarditis .
Resistance to maximal medical therapy
In cases of advanced heart failure resistant and refractory to maximal medical therapy, a durable
mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device (e.g., a left ventricular assist device [LVAD]) is
recommended for select patients (e.g., patients dependent on continuous intravenous inotropes).[2] [87]
There are several accepted indications for implantation of a durable LVAD, including bridge to
transplantation and destination therapy (permanent pump implantation in patients not eligible for cardiac
transplantation).[1] [88] Some of the absolute contraindications for providing durable mechanical
support include irreversible hepatic, renal, and neurologic disease; medical nonadherence; and severe
psychosocial limitations.[89]
In some cases of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, sustained reversal of severe heart failure is seen with
implantation of an LVAD.[90] The use of LVADs has evolved significantly over the past 25 years and
various types of LVAD now exist.
Use of temporary devices can help stabilize patients and allow time for decisions about the
appropriateness of transitions to definitive management (bridge to decision), such as durable MCS or
cardiac transplantation.[2] Extracorporeal devices, the most common of which are the extracorporeal
membrane oxygenators, require full heparinization and are typically used for days or weeks as a bridge
for patients who are expected to recover within days. Percutaneous short-term devices (e.g., Tandem
Heart) are inserted through the femoral artery and advanced into the left ventricle. Longer-term assist
devices are divided into first-generation (e.g., Heart Mate I), second-generation (e.g., Heart Mate II), and
third-generation (e.g., HVAD and Dura Heart) devices. 
Ongoing therapy
Once the patient is stabilized, definitive medical therapy for heart failure should be commenced.
Recommended therapies include:[1] [2]
• Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (i.e., angiotensin-II receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor, ACE
inhibitor, or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist)
• Beta-blockers
• Aldosterone antagonists
• Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.
For patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a combination of drugs from all four
of these medication classes should be commenced, increased rapidly to maximum recommended and
tolerated doses, and continued long term.[2] [68] [91] Patients who have persistent signs of fluid overload
will need ongoing diuretics.
Usually an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril/valsartan) or an ACE
inhibitor (or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated and use of an
angiotensin-II receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor is not feasible) is started first, followed by the
addition of beta-blockers. An angiotensin-II receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor is recommended
both as a first-line treatment for patients newly diagnosed with acute heart failure, and to replace ACE
inhibitor (or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) therapy in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced

ejection fraction that remains symptomatic despite existing therapy.[2] The dose of these agents should
be increased to the maximum tolerated dose depending upon BP and heart rate. Typically, beta-blockers
are started only after patients have stabilized, but should continue long term to reduce the risk of major
cardiovascular events even if symptoms do not improve.[2]
Patients with ongoing symptoms despite this therapy should be treated as having chronic heart
failure. In patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an aldosterone antagonist
(e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone) should be prescribed.[2] Aldosterone antagonists require careful
monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing to minimize risk of hyperkalemia and
renal insufficiency.[2] There is also evidence to support the long-term use of a SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g.,
dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, sotagliflozin) in patients with reduced LVEF regardless of whether they have
type 2 diabetes mellitus.[1] [2] [66][92][93] Patients with diabetes taking SGLT2 inhibitors are at increased
risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (including euglycemic ketoacidosis).[30]
For black patients with low LVEF, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can be particularly
beneficial, and can be considered for other patients unable to take first-line agents.[2]
Patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41% to 49%) should
have repeat evaluation of LVEF to determine the trajectory of their disease process.[2] For patients with
HFmrEF and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%), good control of BP
and other comorbidities (e.g., arrhythmias and underlying ischemia) is essential.[94] There is increasing
evidence that therapies usually recommended for patients with reduced ejection fraction also benefit
patients with HFmrF and HFpEF (LVEF >40%); in particular, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce future heart failure
admissions regardless of ejection fraction and should be started in patients with heart failure before
discharge when possible.[1] [2] [66][68] [92] [94] [95] [96][97] If needed, diuretics may be prescribed to
reduce congestion and improve symptoms.[2]
Treatment with ivabradine in stable patients with chronic heart failure (i.e., LVEF <35%) and a resting
heart rate of >70 bpm - on a background of guideline-based heart failure therapy - is associated with
reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure.[2] [98] In one randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial, addition of ivabradine to standard background therapy did not improve the
outcome in patients with stable coronary artery disease without clinical heart failure (no evidence of left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, in the overall study population mean ejection fraction was 56.4%). In the
subgroup analysis of the study, ivabradine was associated with an increase in the incidence of the primary
end point (death from cardiovascular causes or nonfatal myocardial infarction) among patients who had
angina of Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II or higher but not among patients without angina or
those who had angina of class I. Ivabradine was associated with an increased incidence of bradycardia,
QT prolongation, and atrial fibrillation.[99]
Digoxin significantly reduces the risk of composite end point of mortality or hospitalization in ambulatory
chronic heart failure patients with NYHA class 3 or 4 symptoms, LVEF <25%, or cardiothoracic ratio of
>55%, and should be considered in these patients.[100] In patients with heart failure who are in sinus
rhythm, use of digoxin has no effect on mortality but is associated with a lower rate of hospitalization and
clinical deterioration.[101]

hospitalization in patients with evidence of
pulmonary congestion and volume overload.[1]
[2]
» Patients already taking oral loop diuretics
should be started on a higher dose intravenously
(may require double their usual dose), with
further titration as needed.[2] [66] Diuretic
response should be evaluated shortly after start
of diuretic therapy, initially with hourly urine
output measurement; ongoing monitoring should
include careful measurement of 24-hour fluid
intake and output, vital signs, and standing body
weight measured at the same time each day.[1]
[2]
» The most commonly used agent appears to
be furosemide, but some patients may respond
more favorably to another loop diuretic (e.g.,
bumetanide). Once stabilized, patients should
be switched to an appropriate dose of an oral
diuretic at the minimum dose required to relieve
congestion, keep the patient asymptomatic,

» Vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerin, nitroprusside)
are often used in acute heart failure to relieve
symptoms of pulmonary congestion in patients
without systemic hypotension; however, they do
not improve long-term outcomes (i.e., reduction
of mortality or rehospitalization).[1] [2] 
» Nitroglycerin is preferred in emergency
settings.[34] Nitroprusside is usually given in
the intensive care setting where enhanced
monitoring is available (e.g., invasive
hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring), due
to its potential for marked hypotension and risk
of cyanide toxicity.[2] Dose of nitroprusside
exceeding 400 micrograms/minute generally
does not produce added benefit and may
increase the risk of thiocyanate toxicity.[102]

» Patients with hypotension (systolic BP <90
mmHg) or shock should be commenced
on vasoactive drugs (a vasopressor and/or
inotrope).[1]  
» Cardiogenic shock is characterized by critical
reduction in cardiac output and end-organ
hypoperfusion in a patient with a systolic BP <90
mmHg.[2] 
» Vasoactive agents may cause tachycardia, and
induce arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia.[1]
[2] 
» The preferred vasopressor agent is
norepinephrine (noradrenaline).[1] [2] 
» Inotropes (e.g., dobutamine, milrinone) should
be used with caution because there is evidence
that they result in increased mortality.[1] [2]
[13] Inotropes should be discontinued if there
are sustained arrhythmias or symptomatic
coronary ischemia. Continuous monitoring of
cardiac rhythm is recommended during infusion
of inotropes. There is a lack of robust evidence
to suggest a clear benefit of one inotropic agent
over another in cardiogenic shock.[2] [78]

ejection fraction (LVEF), a combination of drugs
from all four of the following medication classes
should be commenced, increased rapidly to
maximum recommended and tolerated doses,
and continued long-term: renin-angiotensin
system inhibitors (i.e., angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor, ACE inhibitor,
or an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist); a
beta-blocker; an aldosterone antagonist; and
a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2])
inhibitor.[2] [68] [91]
» There is increasing evidence that patients
with mildly reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 41%
to 49%) benefit from the same therapies as
patients with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF
<40%), including use of an angiotensin-II
receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor (e.g.,
sacubitril/valsartan) or an ACE inhibitor.[1]
[2] [68] [95][97] An angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist is recommended if ACE inhibitors
are not tolerated and use of an angiotensin-II
receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitor is not
feasible.
» Treatment with sacubitril/valsartan is
recommended both as a first-line treatment
for patients newly diagnosed with acute
heart failure, and to replace ACE inhibitor (or
angiotensin-II receptor antagonist) therapy in
patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction.[2] Patients with
HFmrEF should have repeat evaluation of LVEF
to determine the trajectory of their disease
process.[2]

Emerging
Tolvaptan
A vasopressin antagonist that may relieve symptoms of acute heart failure, but may not reduce morbidity or
mortality.[103] [104] [105] Tolvaptan should be considered for patients with volume overload, hyponatremia
(<130 mEq/L), and symptoms of hyponatremia for the short-term correction of hyponatremia and associated
symptoms.[36]
Cinepazide
Cinepazide, a vasodilator, was associated with significantly improving symptoms with less adverse effects in
patients with decompensated heart failure, compared with dobutamine.[106]
Vericiguat
Vericiguat is an oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (vasodilator) approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure and ejection fraction less than 45%
(high-risk heart failure), who have recently been hospitalized or received outpatient intravenous diuretics.
When compared with placebo, it demonstrated a reduced incidence of death from cardiovascular causes or
hospitalization for heart failure in this patient group.[107]
Other investigational medications
These include ularitide, tezosentan, istaroxime, perhexiline, relaxin, and cardiac myosin activators. These
agents are investigational and not routinely used to treat acute heart failure.[108] [109] [110] [111] Adenosine
A1- receptor antagonists (e.g., tonapofylline and rolofylline) have failed to show any clinical benefit in initial
studies.[112] [113] When compared with placebo, rolofylline did not show any benefit in patients with acute
heart failure and impaired renal function.[113] In one phase 2 trial of patients with acute heart failure (ejection
fraction ≤40%), treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil (a selective small-molecule activator of cardiac myosin)
did not improve the primary end point of dyspnea, or any prespecified secondary end point when compared
with placebo.[114]
Primary prevention
Aggressive control and treatment of risk factors should be considered in order to prevent acute heart failure.
Coronary artery disease is managed with aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors.
Optimizing treatment of hypertension, smoking cessation, and lipid control provides substantial benefit in
patients with coronary artery disease.
Optimal control of hypertension may require more than one antihypertensive medication.
For the general population, regular physical activity, maintenance of a normal weight, healthy dietary
patterns, and avoidance of smoking are also recommended to reduce future risk of heart failure.[2]
In asymptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), ACE inhibitors are
cardioprotective and reduce further decline in LVEF.[27] Beta-blockers may also be considered in this group
of patients.
All patients with diabetes mellitus, in addition to metabolic control, need aggressive control of lipids, BP
(target <130/80 mmHg) and should be treated with an ACE inhibitor, regardless of the level of the left
ventricular (LV) dysfunction, when other cardiovascular risk factors are present.[28] Patients with type 2
diabetes and either established cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk should use sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, or sotagliflozin) to prevent
hospitalizations for heart failure.[2] [29] Patients with diabetes taking SGLT2 inhibitors are at increased risk of
developing diabetic ketoacidosis (including euglycemic ketoacidosis).[30]

Acute heart failure Management
Alcohol consumption and excessive salt and fluid intake should be discouraged in patients with known LV
dysfunction.[1] [2]
Drugs that can cause or potentiate heart failure should be avoided, if possible.[31]
Secondary prevention
All patients with heart failure are recommended to have pneumococcal vaccination and annual influenza
vaccine.
Patient discussions
Patients should be advised on measures to prevent further episodes:
• Fluid intake restricted to 1 to 1.5 L a day.
• Salt intake restricted: 1 teaspoon of salt equals 2.2 g of sodium. Therefore, patients are advised not
to exceed 1 teaspoon of salt a day. They should lower salt intake as much as possible, ideally to 65
mmol/day of sodium (corresponding to 1.5 g/day of sodium).
• Alcohol intake limited to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day or less for women.
• Importance of continuing medication as prescribed by a doctor should be stressed.
• Weight should be checked daily.
If patients notice more than 2 pounds weight gain in 24 hours, 2 days in a row, or develop symptoms
of shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, increased tiredness, dizziness or lightheadedness, or
increasing swelling of the legs or abdomen, they should seek medical attention.

Acute heart failure Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
During the acute phase all patients require cardiac monitoring. Once stabilized, they can be transferred to
a noncardiac monitoring floor.
After discharge, a telephone follow-up is recommended within 3 days and patients should be reviewed in
the clinic within 7 to 10 days.[32]
Once the acute phase is over and patients are stable and considered to have stable heart failure, they
should be encouraged to do regular aerobic exercise, and it is recommended that they be enrolled in a
multidisciplinary care management program.[1]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
arrhythmias short term high
Acute heart failure is frequently precipitated by arrhythmias, in particular atrial fibrillation, but acute heart
failure may also cause arrhythmias.[120] [121]
complications of treatment: nitroglycerin short term high
Commonly causes headache and hypotension. The headache is usually mild to moderate in severity and
either resolves or diminishes in intensity with continued nitrate therapy. If hypotension occurs then the
infusion rate should be decreased. If hypotension persists then the infusion should be discontinued and
restarted when the patient is hemodynamically stable.
complications of treatment: diuretics short term medium
Overdiuresis leads to worsening of renal function, hypotension, and hypokalemia, and also activation
of neurohormones including renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic system. It may potentiate
the toxicity of other agents like digoxin, either by causing hypokalemia or by decreasing the glomerular
filtration.
In cases of worsening renal impairment due to overdiuresis, the dose of diuretics should be decreased.
In case of severe renal impairment the diuretic can be withheld and the patients assessed daily, with
reintroduction of diuretic at lower doses.
complications of treatment: inotropes short term medium
Dobutamine and milrinone can cause arrhythmias and worsening of coronary ischemia.
The occurrence of sustained arrhythmias should lead to discontinuation. In cases where these
medications are absolutely needed, concomitant use of amiodarone may be advisable, although there are
no large-scale data on the use of antiarrhythmics in this setting. If the patient has symptomatic coronary
ischemia, these infusions should be discontinued.

Acute heart failure Follow up
Prognosis
In hospitals, mortality ranges from 2% to 20% depending on clinical factors found on admission.[116]
Predictors of adverse outcomes include: hypotension, renal dysfunction, older age, male sex, ischemic
congestive heart failure (CHF), previous CHF, respiratory rate on admission >30/minute, anemia,
hyponatremia, elevated troponin, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, and other comorbidities such as
cancer.[117]
One study found that among patients hospitalized with heart failure, patients across the ejection fraction
spectrum have a similarly poor 5-year survival with an elevated risk for cardiovascular and heart failure
admission.[118] All patients in this cohort, regardless of ejection fraction, had a remarkably high mortality
rate at 5 years from index admission (75.4%).[118] One meta-analysis has shown that presence of wide
QRS or bundle branch block (BBB) is associated with a modest increase in the risk of all cause mortality in
patients with acute heart failure (irrespective of the type of BBB).[119]
