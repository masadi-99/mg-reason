Unstable angina Overview
Summary
Unstable angina (UA) should be suspected based on: the presence of symptoms suggestive of myocardial
ischemia (e.g., acute chest pain); ECG findings (no evidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction); and the
result of troponin testing (no dynamic elevation of cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) above the 99th percentile).
A resting 12-lead ECG should be recorded and interpreted within 10 minutes of the point of first medical
contact in any patient with suspected unstable angina (and other acute coronary syndromes [ACS]).
In patients with suspected ACS, nonelevated (or uncertain) hs-cTn levels, no ECG changes and no
recurrence of pain, a noninvasive stress imaging test or coronary computed tomography angiograph (CCTA)
should be considered as part of initial evaluation.
Acute management includes antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy to reduce the extent of myocardial
damage and complications. Further management is based on the results of troponin testing and risk
assessment. This may include dual antiplatelet therapy and an invasive strategy or noninvasive investigation.
Long-term management should aim to modify risk factors for cardiovascular disease and use of drug to
prevent recurrence.
Definition
Unstable angina (UA) is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that is defined as myocardial ischemia at
rest or on minimal exertion in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury/necrosis.[1] It is characterized by
specific clinical findings of prolonged (>20 minutes) angina at rest; new onset of severe angina; angina that is
increasing in frequency, longer in duration, or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a recent episode
of myocardial infarction.[1]

Unstable angina Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death worldwide, accounting for 17.9 million deaths per
year.[5] Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common cause of cardiovascular death; data from the ESC
in 2019 showed that IHD accounted for 38% of CVD deaths in females and 44% in males.[1] [6]
Coronary heart disease mortality has fallen over the last 30 years in Europe and is decreasing in many
developed countries, but is increasing in developing and transitional countries, with more than 75% of
CVD death occurring in developing countries.[5] These trends reflect changes in population longevity,
urbanization, and lifestyle changes.[5] In the US, it is estimated that >780,000 people will experience an
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) each year, and approximately 70% of these will have non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).[2]
IHD is more common in men than in women.[6] [7] Retrospective data from 2010 to 2016 showed that in-
hospital mortality in the US was higher in females with NSTEMI than in males (4.8% compared with 3.9%,
based on unadjusted data). This difference in mortality remained after controlling for age, comorbidities, and
hospital factors.[8] Epidemiology data have shown that ACS cases with ST-elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI) appear to be declining and that NSTEMI occurs more frequently than STEMI.[7] International data
suggests that the incidence of NSTEMI continues to rise.[9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] This is likely to be due to
the advent of more sensitive assays for myocardial injury, earlier pharmacotherapy, and reperfusion (and
prevention) of STEMI.[15]
Etiology
Coronary atherosclerotic disease is the underlying cause in nearly all patients with acute myocardial
ischemia. The most common cause of unstable angina(UA) is coronary artery narrowing caused by a
thrombus that develops on a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque and is usually nonocclusive.[2]
A less common cause is intense vasospasm of a coronary artery (variant or Prinzmetal angina, ischemia and
no obstructed arteries [INOCA], or secondary to cocaine use). This intense vasospasm is caused by vascular
smooth muscle or by endothelial dysfunction in INOCA.
Pathophysiology
The initiating lesion in coronary artery disease (CAD) is a fissure in the vessel endothelial lining over an
underlying cholesterol plaque, which results in a loss in the integrity of the plaque cap. Plaques that fissure or
rupture tend to have a thin fibrous cap, a high lipid content, few smooth muscle cells, and a high proportion of
macrophages and monocytes.[16] [17]
The fissure or plaque rupture leads to exposure of subendothelial matrix elements (e.g., collagen),
stimulating platelet activation and thrombus formation. Release of tissue factor directly activates the
coagulation cascade and promotes the formation of fibrin.
If an occlusive thrombus forms, the patient may develop an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
unless the affected myocardium is richly collateralized. If the thrombus formation is not occlusive, the patient
may develop non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction/UA with nonspecific ST changes on the ECG (ST
depression or T-wave changes).

Unstable angina Theory
Arterial inflammation caused by or related to infection may cause plaque destabilization and rupture and
precipitate acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Activated macrophages and T lymphocytes located at the
shoulder of a plaque increase the expression of enzymes such as metalloproteinase that may cause thinning
and disruption of the plaque, leading to ACS.[18]
Myocardial supply and demand mismatch may cause ischemia without significant CAD. These include:
• Increased myocardial oxygen requirements such as fever, tachycardia, thyrotoxicosis
• Reduced coronary blood flow: for example, hypotension
• Reduced myocardial oxygen delivery such as anemia or hypoxemia
In patients with prior ACS with coronary stents, stent thrombosis or in-stent restenosis may cause ST-
elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, or UA. Both stent thrombosis and
restenosis have complex causes, triggers, pathophysiology, and risk factors. Of importance, premature
cessation of antiplatelet agents in patients with stents (drug-eluting and bare-metal) may trigger an ACS.[1]
[2]
Classification
Classification of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)[1][2]
The term ACS is used to describe the spectrum of conditions that includes UA, non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (non-STEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
The classification of patients is based on ECG findings. Patients are divided into two categories:
1. Chest pain with persistent ST segment elevation (>20 minutes) on ECG is classified as STEMI.
2. Chest pain with no persistent ST segment elevation is classified as non-ST-elevation ACS. The
ECG changes may include transient ST segment elevation, ST depression, T wave inversion, or
pseudonormalization of T wave, or the ECG may be normal.
Further categorization of non-ST-elevation ACS is by measurement of cardiac biomarkers:
• Elevated: non-STEMI
• Nonelevated: UA
Specific clinical findings in UA include prolonged (>20 minutes) angina at rest, new onset of severe angina;
angina increasing in frequency, longer in duration or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a recent
episode of myocardial infarction.[1]
Case history
Case history #1
A 65-year-old man, who smokes and has a history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease,
now presents with increasing frequency and severity of chest discomfort over the past week. He reports
previously having chest pain after walking 3 blocks but now is unable to walk more than half a block
without developing symptoms. The pain radiates to the left side of the neck and is only eased after
increasing periods of rest.

Other presentations
Unstable angina may present without chest pain or with "chest pain-equivalent" or noncharacteristic
symptoms, especially in older populations, female patients, or in the presence of diabetes, dementia, and
renal failure.[1][3] [4] Noncharacteristic symptoms include dyspnea, epigastric pain, indigestion, dizziness,
syncope (usually related to severe pain), sweating, and weakness.[1]

Unstable angina Diagnosis
Approach
Optimal care for patients presenting with chest pain suggestive of unstable angina (UA) includes accurate
and timely diagnosis utilizing a combination of clinical, ECG, and laboratory markers, to minimize time to
appropriate therapy.
History
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be suspected in any patient with acute chest pain, which includes
pain in other areas (e.g., the arms, back, or jaw), that lasts longer than 15 minutes, is associated with
nausea and vomiting, marked sweating, breathlessness, or particularly a combination of these, and/or
is either new in onset or occurs as sudden worsening of known stable angina (i.e., recurrent episodes of
chest pain lasting longer than 15 minutes that occur frequently and with little or no exertion, or decreasing
efficacy of antianginal drugs).[1]
Typical features include age >45 years, smoker, with long-standing hypertension, diabetes, or
hypercholesterolemia. A history of peripheral vascular disease or preexisting heart disease should be
determined.
Most patients present with chest pain, although women, people with diabetes, and older people may
present with noncharacteristic symptoms of ischemia.
Cardiac chest pain is often described as a retrosternal pressure or heaviness that radiates to the jaw,
arm, or neck, and may be intermittent or persistent. Patients may perceive anginal symptoms as pain,
discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing.[78] Specific clinical findings in
UA include prolonged (>20 minutes) angina at rest, new onset of severe angina; angina increasing
in frequency, longer in duration or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a recent episode of
myocardial infarction (MI).[1] Pain may be accompanied by other symptoms such as diaphoresis, nausea,
dyspnea, and syncope.[1] [79]
Patients may present with a range of noncharacteristic classic symptoms, any of which may be the
sole presenting symptom. These include weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and syncope.
These are more common in women, older people, and those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.[1]
 Symptoms usually considered noncardiac may still be ischemic in origin.[78] In appropriate clinical
situations, a diagnosis of UA should be considered when patients present with epigastric pain, recent-
onset heartburn/indigestion (particularly if unrelated to meals), shoulder pain (with or without neck, jaw,
or arm pain), back pain, or isolated dyspnea. Rarely the presenting symptom may be sharp/stabbing
or pleuritic chest pain. However, pain described as sharp, fleeting (few seconds duration), related to
inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or which is shifting in location, suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.
Examination
Physical exam is generally normal in patients with UA. However, the patient may have significant sweating
due to high sympathetic drive.[1] [79] If the patient is hemodynamically unstable (low blood pressure
[BP] or shock), has evidence of left ventricular failure, or has a life-threatening arrhythmia (ventricular
tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) an acute MI should be suspected; these are unlikely to be features of
UA.[80] [81] See Shock , Acute heart failure , Sustained ventricular tachycardias , ST-elevation myocardial
infarction , and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction .

Unstable angina Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Rarely, murmur of ischemic mitral regurgitation, concomitant valvular disease (e.g., aortic stenosis), or
signs of heart failure may be present.
Presence of bruits and peripheral arterial disease suggests extracardiac vascular disease and identifies
patients with higher likelihood of significant coronary artery disease (CAD).
Physical exam is critical in making important alternative diagnoses in patients with chest pain. For
example, aortic dissection is suggested by pain radiating to the interscapular region and the back with
unequal pulses, or murmur of aortic regurgitation. Fever may be suggestive of endocarditis or pneumonia.
Acute pericarditis is suggested by pericardial friction rub, and cardiac tamponade may be evidenced
by pulsus paradoxus. A large pneumothorax may lead to tracheal deviation, hyper-resonance, and
unilaterally decreased air entry. A large pulmonary embolism may result in hypotension with elevated
jugular venous pressure with clear lung fields. Exam also helps in identifying possible precipitating and
contributing factors such as malignant hypertension, thyrotoxicosis, or anemia.
ECG
Guidelines recommend that an ECG be obtained and interpreted by a qualified physician within the first
10 minutes after a patient presents with chest pain.[1] [78][82]
ST-segment depression and T-wave changes may be seen in patients with UA. Alternatively, the initial
ECG may show transient ST elevation, or may be normal.[1] 
Transient ST-segment depression (>0.05 mV) or T-wave inversion (>0.2 mV) during the symptomatic
period that resolve when the patient becomes asymptomatic strongly suggest acute ischemia and severe
underlying coronary artery disease.[2] The extent of ST-segment depression, as well as the magnitude in
millimeters from baseline, are important prognostic indicators.[83] [84] Additional ECG leads (V3R, V4R,
V7-V9) are recommended if ongoing ischemia is suspected when standard leads are inconclusive.[1]
In patients with recurrent symptoms or in case of diagnostic uncertainty, additional 12-lead ECG should
be obtained.[1]
If the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symptomatic and there is a high clinical
suspicion for acute coronary syndrome, serial ECGs should be performed to detect ischemic changes.[2]
[78]
The timing for repeat ECGs should be guided by symptoms, especially if chest pain recurs or a change
in clinical condition develops.[78] In clinical practice a repeat ECG is usually performed at 6 and 24
hours (more frequently if clinical status changes). If possible, previous ECGs should be obtained for
comparison.
Cardiac biomarkers
Cardiac biomarkers (troponin I or T) should be measured on presentation.
High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays allow rapid exclusion of myocardial necrosis and are
recommended by guidelines in the US and Europe.[1] [78] [82] The 0 hour/1 hour algorithm (where
a high-sensitive cardiac troponin measurement is made at presentation [0 hours] and at 1 hour after
presentation) is recommended to rule out non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes, or the 0 hour/2
hour algorithm may be used as a second-best option. Additional testing after 3 hours is recommended
if the first two cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are not conclusive and the

Unstable angina Diagnosis
clinical condition is still suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.[1] A diagnosis of UA can usually be
made if subsequent dynamic troponin testing shows cardiac troponin remaining below the 99th percentile.
Diagnostic imaging including invasive coronary angiography, functional (stress) testing, or coronary
computed tomography angiography may be useful for patients in whom cardiac troponin and ECG results
remain inconclusive.[1]
In clinical practice, diagnostic algorithms for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes should be used
in conjunction with all available clinical information and ECG. Additional serial cardiac troponin testing
should be pursued if clinical suspicion remains high, or whenever the patient develops recurrent chest
pain.[1] [78]
When a previous-generation troponin assay is used, cardiac-specific troponin (troponin I or T) levels
should be measured at presentation and 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset in all patients who present with
symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndromes.[2] Additional troponin levels should be obtained
beyond 6 hours after symptom onset in patients with normal troponins on serial examination when, based
on clinical presentation and/or ECG changes, there is an intermediate or high index of suspicion for acute
coronary syndrome.[2] In low-to-intermediate risk patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome,
undetectable high-sensitivity troponin T values at admission are associated with very low risk of death or
MI within 90 days.[85]
Troponin remains elevated up to 10 to 14 days after release. Thus, in a patient who had an acute MI
several days earlier presenting with chest discomfort, a single, slightly elevated troponin level may
represent old ischemia. In patients in whom a re-infarction is suspected, a troponin re-elevation of 20% or
more has been advocated as a marker.[86]
Among patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, even slightly elevated blood
levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, with a strong
and graded association between all detectable levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T and risk for
myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality. The yearly rate of
death was 0.5% among patients with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels <0.005 micrograms/L, and
this rate increased in a graded manner with increasing levels to 33% among patients with high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin T levels ≥0.05 micrograms/L.[87]
Cardiac troponins are more sensitive and specific markers of cardiomyocyte damage than creatine kinase
(CK), its myocardial band isoenzyme (CK-MB), and myoglobin. In patients with MI, troponin levels rise
rapidly (usually within 1 hour from symptom onset if using high-sensitivity assays) and remain elevated
for several days. Hence, with the advent of hs-cTn, other biomarkers such as CK, CK-MB, and myoglobin
should not be used in diagnosis.[1] [2] [78] [88]
If there is no evidence of myocardial injury or necrosis, the patient with history and ECG changes
suggestive of non-ST-elevation MI (non-STEMI) is considered to have UA.[2]
Other blood tests
Baseline bloods for complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, liver function, blood sugar, C-
reactive protein, lipid/cholesterol profile and coagulation profile should be taken at presentation. Serum
cholesterol falls significantly after a few hours of admission following an MI, so it should be measured at
the time of initial presentation.[89]

Unstable angina Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Imaging
Chest x-ray should be performed on presentation to identify other causes of chest pain.[82]
An emergent echocardiogram should always be performed in patients with cardiogenic shock or
hemodynamic instability.[1] [90] Point-of-care transthoracic echocardiogram can also be used to look
for regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle in patients with an atypical presentation or
equivocal ECG, look for mechanical complications of acute MI (such as left ventricular function, right
ventricular function, ventricular septal rupture, left ventricular free wall rupture, acute mitral regurgitation,
pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade) and for evidence to suggest alternative etiologies associated
with chest pain (e.g., acute aortic disease, pulmonary embolism).[1] [2] [90][91] [92]
A predischarge echocardiogram is indicated for all patients postacute MI to assess left ventricular function
after coronary reperfusion therapy and to guide prognostication.[2] [93]
Invasive coronary angiography (with or without revascularization) should be considered for a patient
with suspected UA (with a negative troponin testing result) based on the risk assessment and clinical
presentation, and is the investigation of choice for assessing the presence and severity of CAD, and
allows concurrent treatment with angioplasty and stenting.[94] Patients with UA have a significantly lower
risk of death compared with those with non-STEMI and get less benefit from an immediate invasive
approach.[95] An inpatient invasive strategy (coronary angiography within 72 hours of admission, with
follow-on percutaneous coronary intervention if indicated) is generally recommended for patients with a
high index of suspicion for UA, particularly for those who have an intermediate or higher risk of adverse
cardiovascular events.[1]
Functional (stress) testing with stress echocardiography, perfusion/stress cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) imaging, myocardial perfusion scan, may be considered by the cardiology team as part of the
initial workup in patients with suspected ACS but nonelevated (or inconclusive) hs-cTn, no ECG changes,
and no recurrence of pain.[1] They can also be performed after stabilization, to identify the extent of
myocardial ischemia and direct patients for possible invasive management.[78] However, do not perform
stress CMR in patients with acute chest pain and high probability of CAD.[96]
In patients with normal ECG and normal cardiac troponins, computed tomographic (CT) angiography
to assess coronary artery anatomy, or rest myocardial perfusion imaging to exclude myocardial
ischemia, may reasonably be performed.[2] [78] Coronary CT angiography has been accepted in the
acute setting to identify significant proximal coronary artery stenosis when ECG is not helpful and an
intermediate clinical suspicion of acute coronary syndrome exists, as indicated by mild angina, prior MI,
compensated or prior heart failure, diabetes, or renal insufficiency.[97] [98] However, do not use coronary
CT angiography in high-risk emergency department patients presenting with acute chest pain as it is
not indicated for patients with high-risk features, for example, ischemic ECG changes or positive cardiac
markers.[1] [96]
Risk stratification
The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the use of
validated chest pain risk scores as part of standardized clinical decision pathways to determine which
patients require further investigation, particularly in settings where high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays
are not available.[78] [82]

Unstable angina Diagnosis
Risk scoring systems provide a summative assessment of the risk of a patient experiencing a major
adverse cardiovascular event, or death, within the next 30 days from presentation with a possible
ACS.[78] They combine troponin levels with other clinical information, such as age, ST segment changes
on ECG, symptoms, and CAD risk factors. Emergent diagnostic testing for suspected CAD is not needed
for patients deemed low risk.[78]
Example validated risk scores recommended by the ACC/AHA include the Thrombolysis in Myocardial
Infarction (TIMI) risk score and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk model.[2]
Do not order a coronary artery calcium (CAC) test in patients with known atherosclerotic disease,
including those with stents and bypass grafts, as this offers limited incremental prognostic value for these
individuals.[96] [100] [101]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
Chest pain (common)
• Cardiac chest pain is typically retrosternal sensation of pain, pressure, or heaviness radiating to the
left arm, both arms, right arm, neck, or jaw, which may be intermittent or persistent. The pain may
occur daily or several times a day, instead of occasionally, or decreasing levels of activity needed to
trigger chest pain and may occur at rest.
Other diagnostic factors
diaphoresis (common)
• Diaphoresis is a common feature due to high sympathetic drive.[79]
• Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be suspected in any patient with chest pain, which includes
pain in other areas (e.g., the arms, back or jaw), that is associated with nausea and vomiting, marked
sweating or diaphoresis, and/or breathlessness, or particularly a combination of these.[79]
epigastric pain (common)
• Patients may present with a range of noncharacteristic symptoms (chest-pain equivalent symptoms),
any of which may be the sole presenting symptom. Epigastric pain, indigestion-like symptoms, isolated
dyspnea, or syncope can indicate ACS. These noncharacteristic presentations are more common in
women, older people, and people with diabetes.[1]
dyspnea (common)
• Isolated dyspnea can occur, particularly in older patients, women, and patients with diabetes.[1]
nausea and vomiting (common)
• Nausea and vomiting are common features. May be the only symptom.
carotid bruit (common)
• Indicates preexisting atherosclerotic disease.

Unstable angina Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
diminished or absent peripheral pulses (common)
• Indicates preexisting atherosclerotic disease.
syncope (uncommon)
• The patient may have syncope. This occurs more frequently in older patients, women, and patients
with diabetes.[1]
back pain (uncommon)
• Be aware that women may present with middle/upper back pain.
arrhythmias (uncommon)
• Most commonly sinus tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular tachycardias are
possible. Urgent and immediate angiography with the intent to perform revascularization is indicated
if the patient has a life-threatening arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation).[1]
 Waiting for results of troponin testing would delay angiography.[1]
abnormal#heart sounds (uncommon)
• A new systolic murmur may be present due to ischemic mitral regurgitation, which is associated with
a poor prognosis, or a mechanical complication (e.g., papillary muscle rupture or ventricular septal
defect). A third heart sound indicates compromised left ventricular function and heart failure and is
associated with worsened prognosis.
rales (uncommon)
• Indicates volume overload and compromised left ventricular function.
Risk factors
Strong
smoking
• Smoking causes nearly 1 in 5 deaths in the US and is the single most important modifiable risk factor
for cardiovascular disease (CVD).[19] Cigarette smokers are substantially more likely than nonsmokers
to develop coronary artery disease (CAD), to have a stroke, and to develop peripheral vascular
disease, and are at increased risk of fatal and nonfatal recurrences of these diseases.[19] [20] [21]
• Smoking increases risk for CAD by direct promotion of atherosclerosis, reduced oxygen delivery in
the blood, increased thrombogenesis, and direct coronary artery spasm.[22] Even mild and passive
smoking, and exposure to environmental tobacco, is associated with increased risk; risk increases
further as the number of cigarettes smoked per day increases.[3] [7][20][23] [24] [25] Current use of
smokeless tobacco also increases the risk of CAD compared with people who have never used.[7] [24]
[25] Patients who stop smoking reduce their risk of recurrent CVD by about one third compared with
patients who do not stop smoking.[26]
• Surprisingly, current smoking is associated with a lower risk of acute death in the setting of acute
coronary syndrome.[2] This is referred to as the "smoker's paradox".[27]

Unstable angina Diagnosis
hypertension
• A major risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and for poor outcomes in patients with ACS.
About 69% of people who have a first myocardial infarction (MI) have blood pressure (BP) >140/90
mmHg.[1] Hypertension is one of the most prevalent risk factors for CAD in the US; approximately
30% of Americans have BP >140/90 mmHg, placing them at greater risk of MI, and of poor outcomes
in the event of ACS.[1] [2] [28] [29] Even prehypertension (untreated systolic BP 120-139 mmHg
and untreated diastolic BP 80-89 mmHg, or both) increases risk twofold compared with normal
levels.[7] High BP induces ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction/damage, and promotes
atherosclerosis, all of which predispose patients to cardiac events. By increasing cardiac after-load
and myocardial oxygen consumption, uncontrolled hypertension can contribute to and worsen anginal
symptoms.
• Effective treatment of hypertension dramatically reduces the risk of cerebrovascular events, heart
failure, and future MI.[1]
diabetes mellitus
• Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).[2] They have
a two- to fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who do not have
diabetes.[30] The mechanisms are not fully known but they may reflect vascular abnormalities of
inflammation, endothelial and smooth muscle function, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
hypercoagulability.
• CAD accounts for 75% of all deaths in the diabetic population.[2] Diabetes is associated with
more extensive CAD, unstable lesions, and less favorable long-term outcomes (death, MI, ACS
readmission), with approximately double the risk of long-term mortality from CAD than that of people
without diabetes following MI.[2] [28]
• An HbA1c of <7% (<53 mmol/mol) is the goal of treatment for patients with diabetes.[7] [31] However,
for patients with CAD, this goal may be less stringent (i.e., <8% [<64 mmol/mol]).[31]
obesity and metabolic syndrome
• Estimates suggest that more than half of adults in Western society are overweight or obese.[7] [32]
[33] Adipokines and other hormones secreted by adipose tissue are highly linked to inflammation and
atherosclerosis.[34] Obesity is associated with diastolic dysfunction and is a strong stimulus for left
ventricular hypertrophy.[35] [36] Obesity and the metabolic phenotype (abdominal obesity with known
history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance) predispose to coronary artery disease,
and increase cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.[2] [7] [33] [35] [37] Bariatric surgery for weight
loss reduces risk of major cardiovascular events (fatal ACS and stroke), incident heart failure and
cardiovascular mortality.[38]
sedentary behavior and physical inactivity
• Sedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[7] Epidemiologic
studies suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between physical activity and cardiorespiratory
fitness and reduced cardiovascular mortality.[39] The relative risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)
associated with physical inactivity ranges from 1.5 to 2.4, an increase comparable to that for high
cholesterol, high BP, and cigarette smoking.[40] Physical activity has antiatherosclerotic, psychologic,
antithrombotic, antiischemic, and antiarrhythmic effects that are important in primary and secondary
prevention of CAD.[39] Regular exercise increases cardiorespiratory fitness and lowers myocardial
oxygen demand.[41] Sustained, regular physical activity lowers BP, reduces lipid levels, reduces
adiposity, increases insulin sensitivity, and decreases inflammation, stress, and adrenergic activity.[42]

DIAGNOSIS
In patients with CAD, there is a direct correlation between the volume of moderate to vigorous physical
activity and reduction in cardiovascular risk and mortality.[43] [44]
dyslipidemia
• Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, decreased high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), and elevated ratio of LDL to HDL are all independently associated with increased
risk of atherosclerosis.[45] There is a linear relationship between reduction in LDL-cholesterol and risk
of MI or other major vascular events; absolute risk reduction of major vascular events depends on the
baseline risk of cardiovascular events and degree of LDL-cholesterol lowering.[46] In postmenopausal
women, dysfunctional HDL may mean that high HDL levels (usually considered protective) are
also associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis.[47] Lipid-lowering therapy reduces future
ischemic events and limits disease progression.[1] [2] [48] [49] Current guidelines recommend
high-dose statin therapy in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) or CAD equivalent,
irrespective of LDL levels.[1] [50] [51] Other lipid-lowering treatments can be considered in patients
who are contraindicated or intolerant of statins.
chronic kidney disease (CKD)
• Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with acute coronary syndrome have chronic kidney disease
(CKD).[1] [52] Excess cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in patients with CKD is caused, at least in
part, by higher prevalence of traditional risk factors in this group; there is a very high prevalence
of comorbid CVDs in patients with CKD, ranging from ischemic heart disease to arrhythmias and
venous thromboembolism.[7] Decreasing glomerular filtration rate is associated with increasing risk of
cardiovascular events, including death.[2] [53]
atherosclerosis (history of angina, MI, stroke, transient ischemic attack,
peripheral vascular disease)
• Atherosclerotic heart disease is the underlying mechanism in coronary artery disease (CAD). It
evolves over decades and can begin in childhood. One study found intimal lesions in the aorta in all
those ages 15-19 years, and in the right coronary artery in more than half of those of this age.[54]
 Atherosclerosis is typically silent until an acute event occurs (e.g., acute coronary syndrome [ACS]).
A sedentary lifestyle, excess caloric intake, and cigarette smoking are strongly associated with
atherosclerosis.
• In an acute setting, the presence or absence of the traditional risk factors for CAD are not specific or
sensitive for diagnosing ACS. However, they do appear to be important in determining prognosis in
ACS and targeting secondary prevention strategies.[2]
• Long-standing angina pectoris is a risk factor for coronary events.[55] Presence of peripheral arterial
disease increases the likelihood of associated coronary atherosclerosis.[2]
family history of premature CAD
• Defined as premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in family members (men ages <50 years; women
ages <55 years).[56] Family history includes a first-degree relative with a history of MI, sudden cardiac
death, aortic dissection, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft. Inherited
(primary) disorders of lipoprotein metabolism are an important cause, though other genetic variants
may also play a role.[57] On physical exam, patients may have eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis
(lipid accumulation within retinal vessels), or tendinous xanthomas. In the acute setting of acute
coronary syndrome (ACS), presence or absence of family history does not help in treatment, but

presence of family history increases the probability of ACS, and is associated with an increased risk of
30-day cardiac events in patients with ACS.[2]
age >60 years
• Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is more common in older patients; the majority of patients presenting
with ACS are age >65 (median age 68).[2] Patients with non-STEMI (NSTEMI) are often older than
patients with STEMI; half of patients with NSTEMI are ages 70 years or older, whereas half of those
with STEMI are ages 64 years or younger.[10] The mean age of patients presenting with STEMI is 60
years for men, and 71 years for women.[58]
cocaine use
• Cocaine accounts for up to 25% of acute MI in people ages 18-45 years.[59] In the hour after cocaine
is used, the risk of myocardial infarction is 24 times the baseline risk.[60] This is probably due to
cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm and thrombosis, in addition to a direct effect on heart rate and
arterial pressure. Cocaine also has direct myocardial toxic properties.[2]
depression
• An independent predictor of future MI in otherwise healthy people.[61] [62]
sleep apnea
• Untreated moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with a 17%
increase in relative risk of cardiovascular events compared with risk in patients without OSA.[63]
 Patients with preexisting OSA are at increased risk of further cardiac events following ACS compared
with patients who do not have OSA.[64] [65]
elevated C-reactive protein levels
• Elevation in C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation) is associated with increased risk of coronary
artery disease and has prognostic value in addition to lipid profile.[66]
mediastinal radiation
• High-dose radiation involving the heart is associated with an increased risk of developing coronary
artery disease, as well as increased cardiovascular mortality.[67] [68]
Weak
migraine
• People with migraine are more likely to have acute coronary syndrome and have higher rates of
cardiovascular mortality.[69] It is unclear whether this is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, or due to higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with migraine.[69]
adverse pregnancy outcomes
• Women who have had adverse outcomes of pregnancy (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
gestational diabetes, preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction) are at increased risk of future
cardiovascular disease.[70] [71]

cardiac biomarkers
• High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays allow rapid exclusion
of myocardial necrosis.[1] [78] [82] The 0 hour/1 hour algorithm
(where a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurement is made
at presentation [0 hours] and at 1 hour after presentation) is
recommended to rule out non-ST-elevation acute coronary
syndromes (NSTE-ACS) when using high-sensitivity assays, or
the 0 hour/2 hour algorithm may be used as a second-best option.
Additional testing after 3 hours is recommended if the first two
cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are
not conclusive and the clinical condition is still suggestive of acute
coronary syndrome.[1] In clinical practice, diagnostic algorithms for
NSTE-ACS should be used in conjunction with all available clinical
information and ECG. Additional serial cardiac troponin testing should
be pursued if clinical suspicion remains high, or whenever the patient
develops recurrent chest pain.[1] [78]
• When a previous-generation troponin assay is used, cardiac-specific
troponin (troponin I or T) levels should be measured at presentation
and 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset in all patients who present with
symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndromes.[2] Additional
troponin levels should be obtained beyond 6 hours after symptom
onset in patients with normal troponins on serial examination
when, based on clinical presentation and/or ECG changes, there
is an intermediate or high index of suspicion for acute coronary
syndrome.[2] In low-to-intermediate risk patients with suspected
ACS, undetectable high-sensitivity troponin T values at admission are
associated with very low risk of death or myocardial infarction (MI)
within 90 days.[85]
• Troponin remains elevated up to 10-14 days after release. Thus,
in a patient who had an acute MI several days earlier presenting
with chest discomfort, a single, slightly elevated troponin level may
represent old ischemia.
• In patients in whom a re-infarction is suspected, a troponin re-
elevation of 20% or more has been advocated as a marker.[86]
• Among patients presenting to the emergency department with chest
pain, even slightly elevated blood levels of high-sensitivity cardiac
troponin T are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, with a
strong and graded association between all detectable levels of high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin T and risk for myocardial infarction,
heart failure, and cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality.
The yearly rate of death was 0.5% among patients with high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels <0.005 micrograms/L, and this
rate increased in a graded manner with increasing levels to 33%
among patients with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels ≥0.05
micrograms/L.[87]
• Cardiac troponins are more sensitive and specific markers of
cardiomyocyte damage than creatine kinase (CK), its myocardial
band isoenzyme (CK-MB), and myoglobin. In patients with myocardial
infarction, troponin levels rise rapidly (usually within 1 hour from
symptom onset if using high-sensitivity assays) and remain elevated
for several days. Hence, with the advent of high-sensitivity cardiac
troponin assays (hs-cTn), do not use other biomarkers such as CK,
CK-MB, and myoglobin in diagnosis.[1] [2] [78] [88] If there is no
evidence of myocardial injury or necrosis, the patient with history
and ECG changes suggestive of non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI) is
considered to have UA.[2]

Thrombocytopenia is an independent predictor of poor outcomes,
including death, major bleeds, and life-threatening prothrombotic

count <100,000/microliter or a relative drop of 50% from baseline.[1]

Test Result
echocardiogram
• An emergent echocardiogram should always be performed in patients
with cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability.[1] [90] Point-
of-care transthoracic echocardiogram can also be used to look for
regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle in patients
with an atypical presentation or equivocal ECG, look for mechanical
complications of acute MI (such as left ventricular function, right
ventricular function, ventricular septal rupture, left ventricular free
wall rupture, acute mitral regurgitation, pericardial effusion, cardiac
tamponade) and for evidence to suggest alternative etiologies
associated with chest pain (e.g., acute aortic disease, pulmonary
embolism).[1] [2] [90][91][92]
• A predischarge echocardiogram is indicated for all patients post-
acute MI to assess left ventricular function after coronary reperfusion
therapy and to guide prognostication.[93] Used to assist diagnosis in
the acute stage if ECG is inconclusive.
• May also provide information about precipitating causes such as
aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or pericardial effusion.
transient regional wall
motion abnormalities
coronary angiography
• Coronary angiography (with or without revascularization) should
be considered for a patient with suspected unstable angina (with a
negative troponin testing result) based on the risk assessment and
clinical presentation, and is the investigation of choice for assessing
the presence and severity of coronary artery disease, and allows
concurrent treatment with angioplasty and stenting.[80] [94]
flow-limiting stenosis
functional (stress) testing
• Functional (stress) testing (e.g., stress echocardiography, perfusion/
stress cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging, myocardial
perfusion scan) may be considered by the cardiology team as part of
the initial workup in patients with suspected ACS but nonelevated (or
inconclusive) hs-cTn, no ECG changes, and no recurrence of pain.[1]
 They can also be performed following stabilization, to identify the
extent of myocardial ischemia and direct patients for possible invasive
management.[78]
• However, do not perform stress CMR in patients with acute chest
pain and high probability of coronary artery disease. Stress testing
can increase risk and delay treatment for patients with acute chest
pain and markers of high risk: for example, ST-segment elevation or
positive cardiac biomarkers.[96]
stress echocardiography:
reversible regional wall
motion abnormalities;
perfusion/stress CMR:
reversible (ischemic)
defect; myocardial
perfusion imaging:

(reversible defects =

coronary CT angiography
• In patients with normal ECG and normal cardiac troponins, CT
angiography to assess coronary artery anatomy, or rest myocardial
perfusion imaging to exclude myocardial ischemia, may reasonably
be performed.[2] [78] Coronary CT angiography has been accepted
in the acute setting to identify significant proximal coronary artery
stenosis when ECG is not helpful and an intermediate clinical
suspicion of acute coronary syndrome exists, as indicated by mild
angina, prior MI, compensated or prior heart failure, diabetes, or renal
insufficiency.[97] [98]
• However, do not use coronary CT angiography in high-risk
emergency department patients presenting with acute chest pain as
flow-limiting stenosis

Stable angina • Pain occurs only in context
of exertion or emotional
stress, not worsening over
time, and relieved by nitrates
or rest.
• ECG may be normal in the
absence of pain but may
show ST depression during
episodes of angina or on
stress testing.
Prinzmetal (variant or
vasospastic) angina
• Typically occurs without
provocation and usually
resolves spontaneously or
with rapid-acting nitrate.[2]
• May be precipitated
by emotional stress,
hyperventilation, exercise, or
a cold environment.[2] [103]
• Most episodes occur early in
the morning.[2]
• May be younger and/or
smoker.[2]
• Calcium-channel blockers
suppress symptoms (beta-
blockers do not suppress
symptoms).[103]
• ST elevation during acute
episode.[2]
• Coronary angiography
(invasive or noninvasive)
excludes severe obstructive
coronary artery disease but
may show spasm.[2] (Fixed
lesions and spasm may
coexist.)
• Nonpharmacologic
provocative tests (e.g., cold
pressor or hyperventilation)
or pharmacologic (e.g.,
acetylcholine) under
supervision and in absence
of contraindications to
provocative testing (left main
disease, advanced 3-vessel
disease, presence of high-
grade obstructive lesions,
significant left-ventricular
systolic dysfunction,
advanced heart failure) may
be diagnostic when invasive
assessment is not helpful.[2]
Non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction
• Clinical presentation may be
indistinguishable.
• ECG may be normal or
show ST depression or T
wave inversion. Cardiac
biomarkers (troponin I and T)
are elevated.
ST-elevation myocardial
infarction
• Clinical presentation may be
indistinguishable.
• ECG shows persistent ST
elevation in 2 or more leads.
Cardiac biomarkers (troponin
I and T) are elevated.
Congestive heart failure • Breathlessness, orthopnea,
tachycardia, and peripheral
edema are usually
predominant. Chest pain
may occur if coronary
perfusion is poor.
• Echocardiogram may show
reduced left ventricular
ejection fraction or signs
of diastolic dysfunction
with normal left ventricular
ejection fraction.
• CXR may show congestion,
cardiomegaly, or pleural

Chest wall pain • Onset often insidious, and
may be history of repetitive
movement or minor trauma.
Pain may be reproduced on
palpation or movement. Not
improved with rest or nitrates
but may be relieved by local
injection of lidocaine.
• CXR or bone scan may show
skeletal pathology such as
rib fracture, osteoarthritis, or
metastatic tumor. Diagnosis
of soft tissue lesions is

Pericarditis • Recent myocardial
infarction, renal failure, chest
irradiation, or associated
connective tissue disease.
• Pain relieved by sitting up
and leaning forward and is
worse when lying supine. If
pleuropericarditis, the pain
may be worse or present
only on inspiration.
• Pericardial rub may be
heard.
• ECG: concave ST elevation
in all leads except aVR; PR
segment depression.
• Echo: may show minimal
pericardial effusion, but is
frequently normal.
Myocarditis • May be preceded by viral
infection.
• Symptoms of myocarditis
include chest pain (which
may be pleuritic as a result
of concomitant pericarditis),
palpitations, fatigue, or
signs of heart failure (e.g.,
peripheral edema, increasing
dyspnea, and weight gain).
• ECG may show evidence
of pericarditis or
myopericarditis (ST elevation
or nonspecific ST-T
changes). Other findings
include arrhythmias or
conduction disturbances.
• Echocardiogram is helpful
in excluding other causes of
heart failure (e.g., valvular
heart disease).
• Troponin levels are elevated
in up to one third of cases.
• Serum viral antibody titers
may suggest recent viral
infection, but testing is rarely
indicated in the diagnosis
of viral myocarditis or any
dilated cardiomyopathy,
owing to its low specificity
and the delay of rising viral
titers, which would have
no impact on therapeutic
decisions.

helps in diagnosis and
when compared with
endomyocardial biopsy
shows a sensitivity of 83%
and a specificity of 53%.

Differentiating tests
• MRI shows an area of
delayed hyper-enhancement
that does not match a
coronary artery territory.
• Endomyocardial biopsy
is necessary to establish
a confirmed diagnosis of
myocarditis. Histologic
criteria for myocarditis
are well established.[104]
However, routine biopsy
for establishing diagnosis
of myocarditis is rarely
helpful clinically, because
histologic diagnosis seldom
has an impact on therapeutic
strategies, unless giant cell
myocarditis is suspected.
Aortic dissection • History of hypertension, or
Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome. Occasionally
precipitated by pregnancy.
• Severe tearing chest pain
radiating between shoulder
blades.
• Unequal pulses, interarm
differential blood pressure,
diastolic murmur of aortic
regurgitation.
• CXR: may show wide
mediastinum.
• CT chest or transesophageal
echo: visualization of
luminal flap will confirm
the dissection. ECG may
show evidence of inferior
ST-elevation myocardial
infarction if the right coronary
cusp is involved in the
dissection, causing blockage
of the right coronary artery.
Pulmonary embolism • Recent surgery,
immobilization, prolonged air
travel, or cancer.
• Acute shortness of breath,
pleuritic chest pain, or
syncope.
• Hypoxia, cyanosis, elevated
jugular venous pressure with
hypotension and clear lung
fields.
• ECG: sinus tachycardia,
right bundle branch block,
S1Q3T3 pattern.
• CXR: oligemic and
hyperlucent lung fields,
wedge-shaped infarct if
pulmonary infarction.
• Ventilation-perfusion scan:
pulmonary embolism is likely
when an area of ventilation is
not perfused.
• CT angiogram: reveals
pulmonary embolism/
thrombus.
Pleuritis • Recent viral infection or
prodrome of infection.
• Chest pain worse with
inspiration.
• Audible pleuritic rub.
• CXR: may show resolving
pneumonia.
Pneumothorax • Underlying lung disease,
trauma, or recent procedures
• CXR: collapsed lung.

Criteria
Severity grading of angina[105]
Angina can be graded according to severity following the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification
from grade 1 to 4.
This grading is based on the New York Heart Association functional classification for heart failure.
• Class 1 symptoms: ordinary physical activity does not cause angina, such as walking or climbing
stairs. Angina occurs with strenuous, rapid, or prolonged exertion at work or recreation.
• Class 2 symptoms: slight limitation of ordinary activity. Angina occurs on walking or climbing stairs
rapidly, walking uphill, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, wind, emotional stress; or only
during the few hours after awakening.
• Class 3 symptoms: marked limitations of ordinary physical activity. Angina occurs on walking 1 to 2
blocks on the level and climbing 1 flight of stairs in normal conditions and at a normal pace.
• Class 4 symptoms: inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort; anginal symptoms may
be present at rest.
Screening
Screening of asymptomatic population
There is no role for screening tests in low-risk patients. Routine screening with ECG, exercise treadmill
test (ETT), or electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) scanning for coronary calcium are not
recommended.[58] [106]

Unstable angina Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
At present there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening with ECG, ETT, or
EBCT scanning for either the presence of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) or prediction of CAD in
adults at increased risk of CAD events.[106]
For individuals in certain occupations, such as pilots, public transport operators, or heavy machine operators
(for whom sudden incapacitation or death may endanger safety of others), considerations other than health
benefit to the individual patient may influence the decision to screen for CAD.

Unstable angina Management
Approach
A 12-lead ECG should be obtained and interpreted within 10 minutes of initial presentation.[1] [78] Until
the results of cardiac biomarkers are known further management will be dictated by ECG findings of ST-
elevation (see ST-elevation myocardial infarction  [STEMI]), or a working diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute
coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) which would include both non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI;
classically ST-segment depression, with elevated cardiac biomarkers, see non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction ) or UA (unstable angina; history and ECG changes suggestive of NSTEMI with normal cardiac
biomarkers).
All patients should be given a single loading dose of aspirin as soon as possible, unless they have significant
bleeding risk or hypersensitivity to aspirin. Pain relief with nitrates should be offered as soon as possible.
Morphine can be added if nitrates are ineffective.[1] [2]
Initial treatment
In cases where a cardiac etiology is suspected, early management interventions should be started while
further results are still pending.[1] The aims of treatment in NSTE-ACS are to alleviate pain and anxiety
and to prevent recurrence of ischemia in any patient with UA, and to modify risk factors for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and offer support for lifestyle changes.[2] [107]
Monitoring
Patients with suspected UA should be triaged to high acuity and be immediately placed on cardiac
monitoring with an available defibrillator.[1] [2] Patients should be monitored for 24-48 hours depending
on symptomatology and angiographic findings. The duration of cardiac monitoring is generally dictated
by the clinical condition, symptoms, presence of ischemia, and arrhythmias.In general, rhythm monitoring
up to 24 hours or to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; whichever comes first) is recommended
for patients at low risk for cardiac arrhythmias and for >24 hours is recommended in patients at increased
risk for cardiac arrhythmias.[1] After PCI, the duration of cardiac monitoring depends on the presence
or absence of ongoing ischemia, and hemodynamic or electrical instability. In general, after successful
revascularization of all ischemic lesions, monitoring should be continued for 12-24 hours and in cases
without revascularization, it should be continued for 24-48 hours.[108]
Risk assessment
The early estimation of risk is based on the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score
and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk model.[2]  The TIMI risk score and
GRACE score both identify patients who would benefit from early invasive therapy, and use of these
scores is recommended to guide the timing of coronary angiography.[94] See diagnosis section for more
information on risk stratification.
In older patients, the presence of comorbid conditions, variable preexisting functional status and patient
preferences regarding goals of care make disease management more complex. An individualized and
patient-centered approach is recommended.[109]
Oxygen
Supplemental oxygen should be given to patients with NSTE-ACS with arterial saturation <90%,
respiratory distress, or other high-risk features of hypoxemia.[2]

Unstable angina Management
MANAGEMENT
Pain relief
Pain relief with sublingual nitrates should be offered as soon as possible. Intravenous nitrates should
be considered for all patients who continue to have chest pain. There are no large-scale randomized
placebo-controlled trials of nitrate use in UA. However, in multiple small open-label studies, intravenous
nitrates have been very useful for relief of angina and symptomatic relief.[110] The main contraindication
for their use is hypotension. The major therapeutic benefit is related to the venodilator effects that lead
to decrease in myocardial preload and left ventricular end diastolic volume, resulting in a decrease in
myocardial oxygen consumption. Nitrates also dilate coronary vessels and improve collateral flow. The
dose should be titrated up until desired effects are achieved or adverse effects, notably headache or
hypotension, develop. Following stabilization, an oral formulation can be started. Morphine can be added
if nitrates are ineffective; there may be some situations where morphine may be used alone (e.g., nitrates
are contraindicated).[2]
Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers are recommended as front-line antianginal drugs.[2] Beta-blockers should be initiated
within the first 24 hours for patients who do not have one or more of the following: signs of heart failure,
evidence of a low output state, increased risk for cardiogenic shock, or other relative contraindications
to beta-blockade (e.g., heart block, active asthma).[2] Intravenous administration is recommended in the
emergency department when there is ongoing chest pain.[111] In other cases, oral treatment is sufficient.
Antiplatelet agents
All patients with suspected NSTE-ACS should be given a single loading dose of aspirin as soon as
possible, unless they have significant bleeding risk or hypersensitivity to aspirin.
An oral P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) is recommended, in addition to aspirin, for
12 months, unless there are contraindications such as excessive risk of bleeding.[1] [2] Ticagrelor and
prasugrel are associated with reduced ischemic events compared to clopidogrel, though there is also an
increased bleeding risk with these agents.[112] [113] [114] [115]
Ticagrelor is recommended, in the absence of contraindications, for all patients at moderate to high risk of
ischemic events (e.g., elevated cardiac troponins) regardless of initial treatment strategy.[1] [2]
Clopidogrel is recommended for patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel. An increased
loading dose of clopidogrel (or a supplementary dose at PCI following an initial dose) is recommended for
patients scheduled for an invasive strategy when ticagrelor or prasugrel is not an option.[1]
Prasugrel is recommended in patients who are proceeding to PCI if there are no contraindications.[1] [2]
[116] Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack,
and its use is not recommended in patients ages >75 years or in patients with low body weight (<60 kg)
due to increased bleeding risk (though dose reductions may mitigate this risk); therefore, ticagrelor is
often more widely used.[1] [94][117][118] [119]
Cangrelor is an intravenous adenosine triphosphate analog that binds reversibly to the platelet P2Y12
receptor and has a short half-life (<10 minutes).[1] [120] It has been shown to reduce periprocedural
death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization, and stent thrombosis when compared
with clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI.[120] [121] It is a second-line treatment option, although

it may be used first-line in patients who are unable to take oral drug (i.e., sedated, unconscious, or
vomiting).
P2Y12 inhibitors have a fast onset of action, allowing a loading dose administration after coronary
angiography and directly before PCI. However, pretreatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor may be considered
in selected cases and according to the bleeding risk, when the patient cannot undergo an early invasive
strategy. In general, routine pretreatment with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, in addition to aspirin, is not
recommended as it may be deleterious in patients who may have other causes of chest pain, such as
aortic dissection. It is also not recommended if early invasive management is planned and coronary
anatomy is not known.[1]
Numerous trials of NSTE-ACS have shown benefit of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in reducing mortality
and cardiovascular events, both in patients treated medically and in those who underwent PCI.[2]
 However, most, if not all, of the trials were conducted before P2Y12 inhibitors became routine therapy.
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce composite ischemic end-points, but increase the risk of bleeding.[2] 
 With no significant benefit of upstream use of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in an invasive strategy,
it is reasonable to withhold it until after invasive coronary angiography. A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor
(eptifibatide or tirofiban) can be administered to patients with NSTEMI and high-risk features (e.g.,
elevated troponin levels) who are not adequately pretreated with clopidogrel or ticagrelor, at the time of
PCI.[2] In patients undergoing PCI and receiving clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
inhibitor use is recommended if there is a large thrombus burden, evidence of a no-reflow, or slow flow.[1]
[94] [122]
Indications for invasive strategies
Acute MI should be suspected if the patient is clinically unstable. Emergent input from a cardiologist is
needed to arrange emergent invasive coronary angiography (with the intent to perform revascularization);
this is unlikely to be a feature of UA. See ST-elevation myocardial infarction  and Non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction .
General recommendations for invasive coronary angiogram with or without revascularization in NSTE-
ACS include:[1] [2] [94]
• An immediate invasive strategy (<2 hours) in patients with at least one of the following very high-
risk criteria:
• Ongoing or recurrent pain despite treatment
• Hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure [BP] or shock) or cardiogenic shock; see
 Shock
• Recurrent dynamic ECG changes
• Acute left ventricular failure, presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia; see
 Acute heart failure
• A life-threatening arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or cardiac
arrest after presentation; see  Sustained ventricular tachycardias
• Mechanical complications such as new-onset mitral regurgitation
• An early invasive strategy (<24 hours) in patients with at least one of the following high-risk criteria:
• A confirmed diagnosis of NSTEMI based on current recommended high-sensitivity cardiac
troponin (hs-cTn) algorithms
• Dynamic ST- or T-wave changes (symptomatic or silent)

Unstable angina Management
MANAGEMENT
• Transient ST-segment elevation
• GRACE score >140
Patients who have no recurrence of symptoms and have none of the high- or very high-risk features
are considered to be at low risk for acute ischemic events and can be managed by a selective invasive
strategy.[1] [107] Patients with UA have a significantly lower risk of death compared with those with
NSTEMI and get less benefit from an emergent invasive approach.[95] An inpatient invasive strategy
(coronary angiography within 72 hours of admission, with follow-on PCI if indicated) is generally
recommended for patients with a working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS and a high index of suspicion for UA,
particularly for those who have an intermediate or higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events.[1]
Patients who are on optimal medical therapy and are still having symptoms should be considered for
cardiac catheterization; the exact timing of this is individualized, based on acuity and chronicity of
symptoms. A noninvasive test for ischemia (preferably with imaging) is recommended in patients with
none of the above-mentioned risk criteria and no recurrent symptoms, before deciding on an invasive
evaluation.[1]
Following a selective invasive strategy, a coronary angiogram is usually carried out for recurring
symptoms, objective evidence of ischemia on noninvasive testing, or detection of obstructive coronary
artery disease (CAD) on coronary computed tomography angiography.[78]
The benefit of early revascularization in NSTE-ACS depends on the finding of a culprit lesion or
coronary obstruction responsible for the clinical presentation. In more than one third of NSTE-ACS
patients undergoing coronary angiography as part of an invasive strategy, no culprit lesion or target for
revascularization is found.[123]
Ongoing medical treatment
The management of UA uses agents that stabilize the coronary plaque and prevent thrombus formation
in an effort to avert or limit myocardial damage. The goal of pharmacologic anti-ischemic therapy is to
decrease myocardial oxygen demand and to increase myocardial oxygen supply.
Anticoagulation
In patients with NSTE-ACS, anticoagulation is recommended for all patients, in addition to antiplatelet
therapy, irrespective of the initial treatment strategy.[1] [2] The options for anticoagulation include
unfractionated heparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; e.g., enoxaparin), a selective factor
Xa inhibitor (e.g., fondaparinux), or a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., bivalirudin).[1] [2] Bivalirudin is a
reasonable alternative to unfractionated heparin for patients undergoing PCI.[94] In aspirin-treated
patients, short-term unfractionated heparin or LMHW (for up to 7 days) reduced the risk of MI, but there
was a trend toward more major bleeds in the heparin studies compared with control studies.[124] [125]
 Some studies have shown a benefit from short-term treatment in terms of mortality, although others have
not.[124] [125] For patients undergoing PCI, fondaparinux alone is no longer recommended due to a
higher incidence of guiding-catheter thrombosis.[94] [126] [127]
The intensity of antithrombotic treatment should be tailored to individual situations and risk of
complications.[128] Triple therapy (antiplatelet agent, anticoagulation, and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor)
is typically used in high-risk patients.[2]
Beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, nitrates

Unstable angina Management
Beta-blockers are front-line antianginal drugs.[2] Beta-blockers should be initiated within the first 24 hours
for patients who do not have one or more of the following: signs of heart failure, evidence of a low output
state, increased risk for cardiogenic shock, or other relative contraindications to beta-blockade (e.g., heart
block, active asthma).[1] [2]
Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (i.e., diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for symptom
relief in patients with continuing chest pain or frequently recurring angina when beta-blockers are
contraindicated and there is no left ventricular dysfunction.[2] [111] There are only small randomized
trials of calcium-channel blockers in non-STEMI. Generally they show efficacy in relieving symptoms,
which seems to be equivalent to the efficacy of beta-blockers. However, calcium-channel blockers do not
reduce mortality in unselected patients. Even so, both diltiazem and verapamil reduce combined end-
points (long-term mortality and recurrent nonfatal MI) in patients with non-Q-wave MI without pulmonary
congestion.[129] In patients without congestive heart failure who are undergoing thrombolysis for acute
MI, the use of oral diltiazem did not reduce the cumulative occurrence of cardiac death, refractory
ischemia, or nonfatal MI during 6 months' follow-up, but it did reduce the composite end point of nonfatal
cardiac events, especially the need for myocardial revascularization.[130] Use of high-dose short-acting
nifedipine (a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) may have a detrimental effect on mortality in
patients with CAD.[131]
Oral nitrates (preferably long-acting nitrates such as isosorbide mononitrate) can be used as second-line
therapy for angina symptoms when calcium-channel blockers are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or not
achieving adequate symptomatic relief.[107] However, expert advice is that they are frequently used in
clinical practice to provide continued symptomatic relief and prevention of angina.
Combination therapy is usually required in most patients (e.g., a beta-blocker plus a long-acting nitrate,
or a calcium-channel blocker plus a long-acting nitrate). The combination of a beta-blocker and a
dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker is usually avoided in practice as using these agents together
increases the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, atrioventricular (AV) block, and PR interval prolongation,
and monitoring is required (e.g., BP, heart rate, ECG). Rarely, a combination of all three drug classes may
be required with appropriate caution and monitoring.
ACE inhibitors
ACE inhibitors are indicated if hypertension persists despite treatment with nitrates, beta-blockers or
calcium-channel blockers, or in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or congestive heart
failure.[2] They are beneficial in high-risk patients (those with a known history of CAD, stroke, peripheral
vascular disease, or diabetes plus at least one other cardiovascular risk factor), including those with
normal left ventricular function, and should be initiated 12-24 hours after presentation, in the absence of
hypotension, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure.[132]
Long-term management
Following stabilization in confirmed UA, patients should be started on long-term antianginal treatment.
Long-term antithrombotic therapy
• Aspirin should be continued indefinitely. For patients with aspirin allergy, long-term ticagrelor
or clopidogrel use is suggested, and in these patients, clopidogrel should also be continued
indefinitely.

Unstable angina Management
MANAGEMENT
• For UA/non-STEMI patients treated medically without stenting, aspirin should be given indefinitely
and clopidogrel or ticagrelor should normally be prescribed for up to 12 months.[2]
• For UA/non-STEMI patients treated with either bare metal stent (BMS) or drug-eluting stent (DES),
aspirin should be continued indefinitely. Clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor should be given for at
least 12 months in patients with DES and up to 12 months in patients receiving BMS.[2]
• In selected patients undergoing PCI, shorter-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (1–3 months)
is reasonable, with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy to reduce the risk
of bleeding events.[94]
• For patients with coronary artery disease, use of low-dose rivaroxaban (a direct oral anticoagulant)
may be considered in combination with low-dose aspirin for 12 months.[1] [133]
• In patients who are event-free after 3-6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and who are not
high ischemic risk, single agent antiplatelet therapy (preferably with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor) can
be considered.[1] In patients with a high bleeding risk, monotherapy with aspirin or P2Y12 receptor
inhibitor may be considered after 1 month of DAPT.[1]
• De-escalation of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor treatment (e.g., with a switch from prasugrel/
ticagrelor to clopidogrel) may also be considered as an alternative DAPT strategy to reduce
bleeding risk.[1]
• De-escalation of antiplatelet therapy is not recommended in the first 30 days after an ACS
event.[1]
• For patients with CAD, use of low-dose rivaroxaban (a direct oral anticoagulant) may be considered
in combination with low-dose aspirin for 12 months.[1] [133]
Long-term management of lipids
• In the absence of contraindications, high-intensity statin therapy (i.e., statin regimens that reduce
low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol by ≥50%) should be started as soon as possible after
admission in all NSTE-ACS patients.[1]
• For secondary prevention, treatment of patients who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) depends on their risk of future ASCVD events.[1] [134] [135] [136]
• Patients are considered to be at very high risk of future events if they have a history of
multiple major ASCVD events (recent acute coronary syndrome [within the past 12 months],
MI other than the recent acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, symptomatic peripheral
arterial disease [claudication with ankle brachial index <0.85, previous revascularization or
amputation]) or one major ASCVD event and multiple high risk conditions (age ≥65 years,
heterozygous family history, history of previous coronary artery bypass graft or PCI, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, current smoking, persistently elevated LDL-
cholesterol [≥100 mg/dL {≥2.6 mmol/L}] despite maximally tolerated therapy, history of
congestive heart failure). Patients at very high risk of future events should receive high-
intensity statin therapy or maximal statin therapy.[134] Ezetimibe may be added if the patient
is on maximal statin therapy and LDL-cholesterol level remains ≥55 mg/dL (≥1.4 mmol/L). 
• A proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor monoclonal antibody (e.g.,
evolocumab, alirocumab) may be added to maximal statin and ezetimibe therapy if LDL-
cholesterol level continues to remain ≥55 mg/dL (≥1.4 mmol/L).
• In patients not at very high risk of future events, high-intensity statin therapy should be
initiated and continued in those up to 75 years of age, with the aim of achieving a 50% or
greater reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels. Moderate-intensity statin therapy may be used

(reducing LDL-cholesterol by 30% to <50%) if high-intensity statin therapy is not tolerated.
Ezetimibe may be added if the patient is on maximal statin therapy and LDL-cholesterol
level remains ≥55 mg/dL (≥1.4 mmol/L). In patients older than 75 years, moderate- or high-
intensity statin therapy should be considered.
Beta-blockers
• Unless contraindicated, beta-blockers should be continued indefinitely in patients with reduced left
ventricular function, with or without symptoms of heart failure.[1] In other patients, beta-blockers
may be useful, but evidence of their long-term benefit is less well established.
ACE inhibitors
• Unless contraindicated, long-term use of ACE inhibitors is indicated in patients with a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 40% or less and also in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or chronic
kidney disease.[1]
• ACE inhibitors should be considered for all other patients to prevent recurrence of ischemic
events.[2]
Long-term anti-ischemic therapy
• Long-term anti-ischemic therapy in patients with stable ischemic heart disease should be
individualized based on patient characteristics and clinical factors (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure,
left ventricular function) and preferences.
• Anti-ischemic treatment options include beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium-channel blockers,
ivabradine, and ranolazine.[107]
See Chronic coronary disease .
Cardiac rehabilitation
In addition to adequate control of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, risk-factor
intervention is recommended.[1] This includes lifestyle modifications (smoking cessation; regular physical
activity, with 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 times/week; a healthy diet based
on low salt intake, a decreased intake of saturated fats, and a regular intake of fruit and vegetables; and
weight reduction).[26] [107] [137]

be given a single loading dose of aspirin as
soon as possible, unless they have significant
bleeding risk or hypersensitivity to aspirin.
» A P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., ticagrelor, prasugrel,
clopidogrel) is recommended, in addition
to aspirin, for 12 months, unless there are
contraindications such as excessive risk of
bleeding.[1] [2]
» Ticagrelor is recommended, in the absence
of contraindications, for patients at moderate-
to-high risk of ischemic events (e.g., elevated
cardiac troponins), regardless of initial treatment
strategy.[1] [2]
» Clopidogrel is recommended for patients
who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel.
An increased loading dose of clopidogrel (or a
supplementary dose at percutaneous coronary
intervention [PCI] following an initial dose) is
recommended for patients scheduled for an
invasive strategy when ticagrelor or prasugrel is
not an option.[1]
» Prasugrel is recommended in patients
who are proceeding to PCI if there are no
contraindications.[1] [2] [116] Prasugrel is
contraindicated in patients with a history of
ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, and
its use is not recommended in patients ages >75
years or in patients with low body weight (<60
kg) due to increased bleeding risk (though dose
reductions may mitigate this risk); therefore,
ticagrelor is often more widely used.[1] [94][117]

Acute

syndrome
1st early coronary catheterization ±
revascularization
» General recommendations for invasive
coronary angiogram with or without
revascularization in NSTE-ACS include the two
strategies below.[1]
» Strategy 1: an immediate invasive strategy
(<2 hours) is recommended in patients with at
least one of the following very high-risk criteria:
ongoing or recurrent pain despite treatment,
hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure
[BP] or shock) or cardiogenic shock; acute
left ventricular failure, presumed secondary to
ongoing myocardial ischemia; a life-threatening
arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
fibrillation); mechanical complications such as
new-onset mitral regurgitation.[1]
» Strategy 2: an early invasive strategy (<24
hours) is recommended in patients with at
least one of the following high-risk criteria:
confirmed diagnosis of non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on current
recommended high-sensitivity cardiac troponin
(hs-cTn) algorithms; dynamic ST- or T-wave
changes (symptomatic or silent); transient ST-
segment elevation; Global Registry of Acute
Coronary Events (GRACE) score >140.[1]
» Patients who have no recurrence of symptoms
and have none of the high- or very high-risk
features are considered to be at low risk for
acute ischemic events and can be managed by a
selective invasive strategy.[1]
» Patients with UA have a significantly lower
risk of death compared with those with NSTEMI
and get less benefit from an immediate invasive
approach.[95] An inpatient invasive strategy
(coronary angiography within 72 hours of
admission, with follow-on PCI if indicated) is
generally recommended for patients with a
high index of suspicion for UA, particularly for
those who have an intermediate or higher risk of
adverse cardiovascular events.[1]
» Patients who are on optimal medical therapy
and are still having symptoms should be
considered for cardiac catheterization.
» Following a selective invasive strategy, a
coronary angiogram is usually carried out for
recurring symptoms, objective evidence of

» Prasugrel is recommended in patients
who are proceeding to PCI if there are no
contraindications.[1] [2] [116] Prasugrel is
contraindicated in patients with a history of
ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, and
its use is not recommended in patients ages >75
years or in patients with low body weight (<60
kg) due to increased bleeding risk (though dose
reductions may mitigate this risk); therefore,
ticagrelor is often more widely used.[1] [94][117]

» Cangrelor, an intravenous adenosine
triphosphate analog that binds reversibly to the
platelet P2Y12 receptor and has a short half-
life (<10 minutes), may be considered in P2Y12
inhibitor-naive patients undergoing PCI.[1] [120]
 It has been shown to reduce periprocedural
death, MI, ischemia-driven revascularization,
and stent thrombosis when compared with
clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI.[120]
[121] It is a second-line treatment option,
although it may be used first-line in patients who
are unable to take oral medication (i.e., sedated,
unconscious, or vomiting).
» P2Y12 inhibitors have a fast onset of action,
allowing a loading dose administration following
coronary angiography and directly before PCI.
However, pretreatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor
may be considered in selected cases and
according to the bleeding risk, when the patient
cannot undergo an early invasive strategy.

» fondaparinux: 2.5 mg subcutaneously once
daily, continue until hospital discharge
» Anticoagulation is recommended for all
patients, in addition to antiplatelet therapy,
irrespective of the initial treatment strategy.[1] [2]
» Options for anticoagulation include
unfractionated heparin, a low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH; e.g., enoxaparin), or a direct
thrombin inhibitor (e.g., bivalirudin).[1] [2]
» Bivalirudin is a reasonable alternative to
unfractionated heparin for patients undergoing
PCI.[94]
» In aspirin-treated patients, short-term
unfractionated heparin or LMWH (for up to 7
days) reduced the risk of MI, but there was a
trend toward more major bleeds in the heparin
studies compared with control studies.[124] [125]
 Some studies have shown a benefit from short-
term treatment in terms of mortality, although
others have not.[124] [125]
» For patients undergoing PCI, fondaparinux (a
selective factor Xa inhibitor) alone is no longer
recommended due to a higher incidence of
guiding-catheter thrombosis.[94] [126] [127]
» The intensity of antithrombotic treatment
should be tailored to individual situations
and risk of complications.[128] Triple therapy
(antiplatelet agents, heparin, and glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitors) is typically used in high-risk
patients.[2]

» Beta-blockers are front-line anti-anginal drugs.
[2] Beta-blockers should be initiated within
the first 24 hours for patients who do not have
one or more of the following: signs of heart
failure, evidence of a low output state, increased
risk for cardiogenic shock, or other relative
contraindications to beta-blockade (e.g., heart
block, active asthma).[1] [2]
» Intravenous administration is recommended
in the emergency department when there is
ongoing chest pain.[111] In other cases, oral
treatment is sufficient.
» Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
(i.e., diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended
for symptom relief in patients with continuing
chest pain or frequently recurring angina
when beta-blockers are contraindicated and
there is no left ventricular dysfunction.[2] [111]
 There are only small randomized trials of
calcium-channel blockers in non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction. Generally they show
efficacy in relieving symptoms, which seems to
be equivalent to the efficacy of beta-blockers.

However, calcium-channel blockers do not
reduce mortality in unselected patients. Even
so, both diltiazem and verapamil reduce
combined end-points (long-term mortality and
recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI]) in
patients with non-Q-wave MI without pulmonary
congestion.[129] In patients without congestive
heart failure who are undergoing thrombolysis
for acute MI, the use of oral diltiazem did not
reduce the cumulative occurrence of cardiac
death, refractory ischemia, or nonfatal MI
during 6 months' follow-up, but it did reduce
the composite end-point of nonfatal cardiac
events, especially the need for myocardial
revascularization.[130] Use of high-dose short-
acting nifedipine (a dihydropyridine calcium-
channel blocker) may have a detrimental effect
on mortality in patients with coronary artery
disease.[131]
» Oral nitrates (preferably long-acting nitrates,
such as isosorbide mononitrate) can be used
for angina symptoms when calcium-channel
blockers are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or
not achieving adequate symptomatic relief.[107]
 However, expert advice is that they are
frequently used in clinical practice to provide
continued symptomatic relief and prevention of
angina.
» Combination therapy is usually required in
most patients (e.g., a beta-blocker plus a long-
acting nitrate, or a calcium-channel blocker
plus a long-acting nitrate). The combination of
a beta-blocker and a dihydropyridine calcium-
channel blocker is usually avoided in practice
as using these agents together increases the
risk of hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and
PR interval prolongation, and monitoring is
required (e.g., BP, heart rate, ECG). Rarely, a
combination of all three drug classes may be
required with appropriate caution and monitoring.

» Numerous trials of NSTE-ACS have shown
benefit of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in
reducing mortality and cardiovascular events,
both in patients treated medically and in those
who underwent PCI.[2] However, most, if not
all, of the trials were conducted before P2Y12
inhibitors became routine therapy. Glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce composite ischemic
end-points, but increase the risk of bleeding.[2] 
 With no significant benefit of upstream use of
a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in an invasive
strategy, it is reasonable to withhold it until after
invasive coronary angiography.
» A glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide
or tirofiban) can be administered to patients
with NSTEMI and high-risk features (e.g.,
elevated troponin levels) who are not adequately
pretreated with clopidogrel or ticagrelor, at
the time of PCI.[2] In patients undergoing
PCI and receiving clopidogrel, prasugrel, or
ticagrelor, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use
is recommended if there is a large thrombus

» Aspirin should be continued indefinitely. For
patients with aspirin allergy, long-term ticagrelor
or clopidogrel use is suggested, and in these
patients, clopidogrel should also be continued
indefinitely. Prasugrel may be used in these
patients treated with a stent.
» Duration of long-term antiplatelet therapy:
for UA/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
(non-STEMI) patients treated medically without
stenting, aspirin should be given indefinitely and
clopidogrel or ticagrelor should be prescribed for
up to 12 months.[2]
» For UA/non-STEMI patients treated with either
bare metal stent (BMS) or drug-eluting stent
(DES) aspirin should be continued indefinitely.
Clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor should be
given for at least 12 months in patients with
DES and up to 12 months in patients receiving
BMS.[2]
» In selected patients undergoing percutaneous
coronary intervention, shorter-duration dual
antiplatelet therapy (1–3 months) is reasonable,
with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor
monotherapy to reduce the risk of bleeding
events.[94]
» In patients who are event-free after 3-6 months
of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and who
are not high ischemic risk, single antiplatelet
therapy (preferably with a P2Y12 receptor
inhibitor) can be considered.[1] In patients with
a high bleeding risk, monotherapy with aspirin or
P2Y12 receptor inhibitor may be considered after
1 month of DAPT.[1] De-escalation of P2Y12
receptor inhibitor treatment (e.g., with a switch
from prasugrel/ticagrelor to clopidogrel) may also
be considered as an alternative DAPT strategy
to reduce bleeding risk.[1] De-escalation of
antiplatelet therapy is not recommended in the
first 30 days after an ACS event.[1]

use of low-dose rivaroxaban (a direct
oral anticoagulant) may be considered in
combination with low-dose aspirin for 12
months.[1] [133]

Unstable angina Management
Emerging
Factor IX inhibitors
Pegnivacogin, a factor IX inhibitor that is reversible with anivamersen, has been shown to reduce the
incidence of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared with intravenous
heparin, when given during coronary interventions. This was in a phase 2 study that did not include patients
with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). One phase 3 trial including STEMI patients is currently
underway.[138] [139][140]
Factor XI inhibitors
Multiple factor XI inhibitors are under investigation for various indications.[141] Asundexian, a small molecule
factor XIa inhibitor, has been investigated specifically for ACS.[141]
L-carnitine
One meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled trials found L-carnitine to significantly reduce all-cause mortality,
ventricular arrhythmias, and angina symptoms in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction (MI).
Further evaluation is needed.[142]
Bone marrow stem-cell therapy
Stem-cell therapy has been proposed as a potential therapy for the repair and regeneration of damaged
vascular and cardiac tissue following an acute MI. Although current evidence suggests that stem-cell therapy
is safe, its effect on mortality, quality of life, and myocardial function following an acute MI is unclear.[143]
 This is based, however, on limited evidence from small clinical trials. One randomized controlled study
found intracoronary bone marrow cell therapy to be safe, but its effect on myocardial function and myocardial
salvage was unclear.[144]
Colchicine
Several randomized control trials have investigated the role of the anti-inflammatory agent colchicine in both
chronic and ACS.[1] [145] Use of colchicine for secondary prevention was shown to significantly reduce
composite cardiovascular end points (including cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke) in two meta-analyses
of trials investigating patients with a previous acute coronary event.[145] [146] [147] Research suggests the
beneficial effect is greater with early, in-hospital initiation of treatment.[148] Patients should be investigated
for liver and/or kidney disease prior to commencing colchicine.[149] The European Society of Cardiology
recommends that low-dose colchicine be considered for long-term management of patients with ACS on
the basis of its anti-inflammatory properties, particularly if other risk factors are insufficiently controlled or
recurrent cardiovascular events occur under optimal therapy.[1]
Dalcetrapib
Dalcetrapib, a cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the incidence of
new-onset diabetes in patients with recent ACS.[150]
Polypill therapy
One pill that combines routine post-ACS drugs (e.g., aspirin, an ACE inhibitor such as ramipril, and a statin
such as atorvastatin) has been shown to improve treatment compliance and consequently reduce risk of
adverse cardiovascular events post-ACS.[151]
Semaglutide
The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist semaglutide has been shown to reduce the risk of
death from cardiovascular causes in overweight patients with other cardiovascular risk factors.[152] [153]

Vorapaxar
Vorapaxar is an oral competitive protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist that inhibits thrombin-induced
platelet aggregation. In patients with ACS, the addition of vorapaxar to standard therapy did not significantly
reduce the primary end point, but significantly increased the risk of major bleeding including intracranial
hemorrhage.[154]
Primary prevention
The most important preventive actions involve combined dietary and lifestyle modifications (stopping
smoking; increasing physical activity; losing weight; increasing consumption of fish, fruits, vegetables, fiber,
and nuts; reducing salt intake).[72] The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends using the "5A
model" (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) as a framework for counseling patients in behavioral change
to reduce CVD risk.[73]
Although weight loss interventions improve cardiovascular risk factors (including weight, blood pressure,
lipids, insulin resistance) there is limited evidence of improved cardiovascular outcomes in weight loss
trials.[74] Given the imperfections of BMI as a risk marker, the limited efficacy of even multicomponent
lifestyle interventions in promoting sustained weight loss, and concern for weight stigma as a barrier to care,
providers might also focus on physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness rather than weight per se as a
treatment goal.
Smoking is a leading preventable cause of disease, disability and death; even low levels of smoking increase
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).[20] [72]
Support programs, medications, and alternative therapies are available. In adults who use tobacco, a
combination of behavioral interventions plus pharmacotherapy is recommended.[72] Secondhand smoke
exposure should be avoided.[72]
Routine and/or opportunistic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors with calculation of 10-year risk of
ASCVD should be used to guide decisions on treatment with preventive therapies (e.g., statins).[72] [75] 
[ACC: ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus] (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator)
Among adults at borderline (5.0% to <7.5%) and intermediate (≥7.5% to <20.0%) risk, the American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) states that it is reasonable to use the following
additional individual risk-enhancing clinical factors to guide decisions about preventive therapy.[72]
• Family history of premature ASCVD (men, age <55 years; women, age <65 years)
• Primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 160-189 mg/dL [4.1-4.8
mmol/L]; non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] 190-219 mg/dL [4.9-5.6 mmol/L])
• Optimally, three determinations
• Metabolic syndrome (increased waist circumference [by ethnically appropriate cutpoints], elevated
triglycerides [>150 mg/dL, nonfasting], elevated blood pressure, elevated glucose, and low HDL-C [<40
mg/dL in men; <50 mg/dL in women] are factors; a tally of three makes the diagnosis)
• Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with or
without albuminuria; not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation)
• Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or HIV/AIDS
• History of premature menopause (before age 40 years) and history of pregnancy-associated
conditions that increase later ASCVD risk, such as preeclampsia
• High-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., South Asian ancestry)
• Lipids/biomarkers: associated with increased ASCVD risk
• Persistently elevated (optimally, three determinations) primary hypertriglyceridemia (≥175 mg/
dL, nonfasting)
• If measured: elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (≥2.0 mg/L)

Unstable angina Management
• If measured: elevated lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)): A relative indication for its measurement is family
history of premature ASCVD. An Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL or ≥125 nmol/L constitutes a risk-enhancing
factor, especially at higher levels of Lp(a)
• If measured: elevated apolipoprotein B (apoB) (≥130 mg/dL). A relative indication for its
measurement is triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL. A level ≥130 mg/dL corresponds to an LDL-C >160
mg/dL and constitutes a risk-enhancing factor
• If measured: ankle-brachial index (ABI) (<0.9)
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends starting statin therapy for primary prevention in adults
ages 40 to 75 years without ASCVD but who have one or more cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia,
diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or
greater.[76] Those with 10-year risk of between 7.5% and 10.0% may selectively be offered a statin.[76]
 For patients 76 years or older there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against starting a statin for
primary prevention.[76]
Aspirin is no longer routinely recommended for primary prevention but may be considered in selected
patients for whom the absolute cardiovascular benefit outweighs the absolute risk of increased bleeding.[77]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of CVD from the ACC/AHA.[72]
 Estimate CVD risk using a 10-year risk calculator, such as the Pooled Cohort Equations (ASCVD Risk
Estimator Plus). Newer calculators such as PREVENT™ may yield fewer treatment recommendations if
applied at thresholds as outlined in the table below; adjustments to risk thresholds may be required if using
PREVENT™ in conjunction with the ACC/AHA primary prevention guidance, although evidence to support
this approach is limited.
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.
Adults at borderline risk for ASCVD; without type 2 diabetes
5.0% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk

Intervention Goal
Smoking cessation counseling ±

Advise all adults who use tobacco to quit; a
combination of behavioral interventions plus
pharmacotherapy is recommended to maximize quit
rates.
Advise all patients to avoid secondhand smoke
exposure to reduce ASCVD risk.

With overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle
interventions
Where feasible, refer patients for comprehensive
lifestyle interventions as part of a structured
program incorporating regular self-monitoring of
food intake, physical activity, and weight.
The ACC/AHA states that high intensity (≥14
sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight loss
interventions provided by a trained interventionist
work best. However, it is noted that other modalities,
such as electronically delivered weight loss
programs with personalized feedback and some
commercial-based programs, have also shown
moderate results.
Consider whether to offer select patients, or refer
them for, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved pharmacologic therapies and bariatric
surgery, adjunctive to complementary lifestyle
interventions.
It is recommended that BMI is interpreted with
caution in people of Asian ancestry, older adults,
and muscular adults.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss; reduced waist circumference;
increased physical activity; reduced caloric
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Weight loss:
• The ACC/AHA defines clinically meaningful
weight loss as ≥5% initial weight.
Waist circumference:
• Definitions of elevated waist circumference
are ≥40 inches (≥102 cm) in men and ≥35
inches (≥88 cm) in women.
Physical activity:
• Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic
physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥150
minutes/week (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on
most days of the week), is recommended for
initial weight loss.
• Higher levels of physical activity,
approximately 200-300 minutes/week, are
recommended to maintain weight loss or
minimize weight regain after 1 year.
Reduced caloric intake:
• Caloric intake should be reduced by ≥500
kcal/day from baseline, which often can be
attained by limiting women to 1200-1500 kcal/
day and men to 1500-1800 kcal/day.
• A very-low-calorie diet (defined as <800
kcal/day) is recommended only in limited
circumstances and only by trained clinicians
in a medical care setting with the patient
under medical supervision.

With moderate or severe hypercholesterolemia
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
A maximally-tolerated statin is recommended for
all patients ages 20-75 years with severe primary
hypercholesterolemia, regardless of estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk.
For patients ages >75 years, statins are not
routinely recommended, but may be considered on
a case-by-case basis depending on the individual
risk status and potential for adverse effects.
Although statins are not routinely recommended
in young adults ages 20-39 years, they
may be considered in those with moderate
hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1
mmol/L]) where there is a positive family history of
premature ASCVD.

With risk-enhancing factors or high coronary artery calcium score, but no
hypercholesterolemia; ages 40-75 years
Intervention Goal
Consider a moderate-intensity statin
If risk-enhancing factors are present, have a risk
discussion with the patient regarding initiation of a
moderate-intensity statin.
Coronary artery calcium scoring is not routinely
used to guide treatment decisions in the borderline
risk group. However in select borderline risk adults it
may be used to guide decision making regarding the
need for a statin as follows.
• Coronary artery calcium score 0 Agatston
units (AU): reasonable to withhold a statin
and reassess in 5-10 years, providing higher
risk conditions (e.g., diabetes, family history
of premature CHD, cigarette smoking) are
absent.
• Coronary artery calcium score 1-99 AU:
reasonable to initiate statin treatment for
patients ≥55 years.
• Coronary calcium score ≥100 AU or ≥75th
age/sex/race percentile: reasonable to initiate
a statin.
For patients >75 years old, statins are not routinely
recommended; assessment of risk status and a
clinician–patient risk discussion is needed to decide
whether to continue or initiate statin treatment,
taking into account statin safety and the potential for
statin-associated adverse effects.

Unstable angina Management
With overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle
interventions
Where feasible, refer patients for comprehensive
lifestyle interventions as part of a structured
program incorporating regular self-monitoring of
food intake, physical activity, and weight.
The ACC/AHA states that high intensity (≥14
sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight-loss
interventions provided by a trained interventionist
work best. However, it is noted that other modalities,
such as electronically delivered weight-loss
programs with personalized feedback and some
commercial-based programs, have also shown
moderate results.
Consider whether to offer select patients, or refer
for pharmacologic therapies and bariatric surgery,
adjunctive to complementary lifestyle interventions.
It is recommended that BMI is interpreted with
caution in people of Asian ancestry, older adults,
and muscular adults.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss; reduced waist circumference;
increased physical activity; reduced caloric
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Weight loss:
• The ACC/AHA defines clinically meaningful
weight loss as ≥5% initial weight.
Waist circumference:
• Definitions of elevated waist circumference
are ≥40 inches (≥102 cm) in men and ≥35
inches (≥88 cm) in women.
Physical activity:
• Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic
physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥150
minutes/week (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on
most days of the week), is recommended for
initial weight loss.
• Higher levels of physical activity,
approximately 200 to 300 minutes/week, are
recommended to maintain weight loss or
minimize weight regain after 1 year.
Reduced caloric intake:
• Caloric intake should be reduced by ≥500
kcal/day from baseline, which often can be
attained by limiting women to 1200-1500 kcal/
day and men to 1500-1800 kcal/day.
• A very-low-calorie diet (defined as <800
kcal/day) is recommended only in limited
circumstances and only by trained clinicians
in a medical care setting with the patient
under medical supervision.

Unstable angina Management
MANAGEMENT
With moderate or severe hypercholesterolemia
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
A maximally-tolerated statin is recommended for
all patients ages 20-75 years with severe primary
hypercholesterolemia, regardless of estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk.
For patients ages >75 years, statins are not
routinely recommended, but may be considered on
a case-by-case basis depending on the individual
risk status and potential for adverse effects.
Although statins are not routinely recommended
in young adults ages 20-39 years, they
may be considered in those with moderate
hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1
mmol/L]) where there is a positive family history of
premature ASCVD.

Unstable angina Management
Without severe primary cholesterolemia (LDL-C <190 mg/dL [<4.9 mmol/L]); ages 40-75 years
Intervention Goal
Consider a moderate-intensity statin,
following risk discussion
Have a risk discussion with the patient to decide
whether to initiate a moderate-intensity statin.
Knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for
all patients but particularly for those at intermediate
risk (ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤20%). The presence
of risk-enhancing factors may lower the threshold for
statin initiation or intensification.
In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery
calcium scores may also be used to guide treatment
decisions as follows:
• Coronary artery calcium score 0 AU:
reasonable to withhold a statin and reassess
in 5-10 years, providing higher risk conditions
(e.g., diabetes, family history of premature
CHD, and cigarette smoking) are absent.
• Coronary artery calcium score 1-99 AU:
reasonable to initiate statin treatment for
patients ages ≥55 years.
• Coronary calcium score ≥100 AU or ≥75th
age/sex/race percentile:reasonable to initiate
a statin.
For patients ages >75 years, statins are not
routinely recommended; assessment of risk status
and a clinician-patient risk discussion is needed
to decide whether to continue or initiate statin
treatment, taking into account statin safety and the
potential for statin-associated adverse effects.
Reduction in LDL-C by 30% to 49%; reduced
overall risk of ASCVD

Intervention Goal
kidney disease, a target blood pressure
<130/80 mmHg is usually recommended.
With comprehensive evaluation suggestive of a favorable risk:benefit ratio for prophylactic
aspirin; ages 40-70 years
Intervention Goal
Consider low-dose aspirin
To balance the benefits and risks, low-dose aspirin
is recommended only for select adults ages 40-70
years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at
increased bleeding risk, following shared decision
making.
The ACC/AHH notes that prophylactic aspirin
generally becomes more favorable for patients with
>10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. This is an
individualized decision:
• Contemporary data show that absolute
risk for ASCVD events typically exceeds
that of bleeding and, although the gap of
relative benefit to relative harm for aspirin
has narrowed, the number needed to treat
to prevent an ASCVD event remains lower
than the number needed to harm to cause
bleeding.
• Some patients, in discussion with their
clinician, may feel that the benefit of
prophylactic aspirin is comparable to the
risk and may instead choose to focus on
optimal control of other modifiable ASCVD
risk factors.
Consider risk enhancing factors ± coronary artery
score, where available, as part of the risk:benefit
analysis.
Prophylactic aspirin is not typically recommended
for:
• Adults ages >70 years due to a potential risk
of harm, including increased risk of bleeding.
• Those ages <40 years; there is insufficient
evidence to judge the risk:benefit ratio of
routine aspirin for the primary prevention of
ASCVD in this age group.
Reduction of CVD risk
Reassess the appropriateness of treatment at
regular intervals, in case known risk factors for
increased bleeding develop, which may alter the
risk:benefit assessment.
Consider treatment discontinuation at ages 70
years; prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention
adults ages >70 years is potentially harmful and is
not recommended on a routine basis.
Adults at high risk for ASCVD; without type 2 diabetes

Unstable angina Management
With stage 1 (blood pressure 130-139/80-89 mmHg) or stage 2 (blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg)
hypertension
Intervention Goal
Nonpharmacologic treatment and medication
to lower blood pressure
Recommend the following nonpharmacologic
treatment to patients:
• Weight loss
• A heart-healthy dietary pattern
• Sodium restriction
• Dietary potassium supplementation
• Increased physical activity with a structured
exercise program
• Limited alcohol intake.
Offer antihypertensive medication in line with
published clinical guidance on management of
hypertension.
See Essential hypertension .
Blood pressure reduction (goal typically
<130/80 mmHg); improved dietary habits;
increased physical activity; reduced alcohol
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Assess adherence to, and the impact of,
nonpharmacologic treatment within 3-6 months.
Weight loss:
• The best goal is ideal body weight, but aim
for at least a 1 kg reduction in body weight for
most adults who are overweight.
Heart-healthy dietary pattern:
• Aim for consumption of a diet rich in fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy
products, with reduced content of saturated
and total fat.
Sodium restriction:
• Optimal goal is <1500 mg/day, but aim for at
least a 1000 mg/day reduction in most adults.
Dietary potassium supplementation:
• Aim for 3500-5000 mg/day, preferably by
consumption of a diet rich in potassium.
Increased physical activity:
• Aerobic exercise: aim for 90-150 minutes/
week, 65% to 75% heart rate reserve.
• Dynamic resistance: aim for 90-150 minutes/
week.
• Isometric resistance: aim for 4 × 2 minutes
(hand grip), 1 minute rest between exercises,
30% to 40% maximum voluntary contraction,
three sessions/week for 8-10 weeks.
Limited alcohol intake:
• For people who consume alcohol, reduce
consumption to ≤2 drinks daily (men) or ≤1
drink daily (women).

Unstable angina Management
MANAGEMENT
Intervention Goal
• For those requiring pharmacologic treatment
for hypertension, including those with chronic
kidney disease, a target blood pressure
<130/80 mmHg is usually recommended.
With comprehensive evaluation suggestive of a favorable risk:benefit ratio for prophylactic
aspirin; ages 40-70 years
Intervention Goal
Consider low-dose aspirin
To balance the benefits and risks, low-dose aspirin
is recommended only for select adults ages 40-70
years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at
increased bleeding risk, following shared decision
making.
The ACC/AHH notes that prophylactic aspirin
generally becomes more favorable for patients with
>10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. This is an
individualized decision:
• Contemporary data show that absolute
risk for ASCVD events typically exceeds
that of bleeding and, although the gap of
relative benefit to relative harm for aspirin
has narrowed, the number needed to treat to
prevent an ASCVD event remains lower than
the number needed to cause harm (bleeding).
• Some patients, in discussion with their
clinician, may feel that the benefit of
prophylactic aspirin is comparable to the
risk and may instead choose to focus on
optimal control of other modifiable ASCVD
risk factors.
Consider risk enhancing factors ± coronary artery
score, where available, as part of the risk:benefit
analysis.
Prophylactic aspirin is not typically recommended
for:
• Adults ages >70 years due to a potential risk
of harm, including increased risk of bleeding.
• Those ages <40 years; there is insufficient
evidence to judge the risk:benefit ratio of
routine aspirin for the primary prevention of
ASCVD in this age group.
Reduction of CVD risk
Reassess the appropriateness of treatment at
regular intervals, in case known risk factors for
increased bleeding develop, which may alter the
risk:benefit assessment.
Consider treatment discontinuation at age 70;
prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults
ages >70 years is potentially harmful and is not
recommended on a routine basis.

Unstable angina Management
Secondary prevention
Aggressive risk-factor intervention is recommended.[1]
• Smoking cessation should be strongly advised, including use of resources and adjunctive agents.
• For adults with confirmed hypertension and known cardiovascular disease or 10-year atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease event risk of 10% or higher, a BP target of less than 130/80 mmHg is
recommended.[175]
• LDL levels should be lowered to goals of <55 mg/dL.
• HbA1C should be kept at <0.07 (<7% of total hemoglobin) in patients with diabetes.
• In patients with ischemic heart disease, an automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is
recommended for primary prevention in the following scenarios:[156]
• In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less that is due to ischemic heart
disease who are at least 40 days post-myocardial infarction (MI) and at least 90 days post
revascularization, and with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure
despite appropriate management, an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than
1 year is expected
• In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less that is due to ischemic heart
disease who are at least 40 days post-MI and at least 90 days post revascularization, and
with NYHA class I heart failure despite appropriate management, an ICD is recommended if
meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected
• In patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia due to prior MI, left ventricular ejection
fraction of 40% or less, and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation
at electrophysiological study, an ICD is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than 1
year is expected
• For secondary prevention in patients with ischemic heart disease, an automated ICD is recommended
when the history is consistent with an arrhythmic etiology for syncope and ejection fraction <35%.[156]
Clinicians caring for cardiac patients need to be aware of the high incidence of major depressive disorder in
this population, and its association with worsened cardiovascular outcomes.[176] Accordingly, screening for
symptoms of depression should be performed and therapy, including pharmacologic, should be offered.[177]
Cardiac rehabilitation, a long-term multifaceted program including exercise, dietary and lifestyle interventions,
patient education, and counseling, is recommended for appropriate non-ST-elevation acute coronary
syndrome patients and may improve clinical outcomes.[137][178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [Evidence B]
Patient discussions
Patients with UA should be targeted for aggressive lifestyle and risk-factor modification.
They may return to their usual activities, but are often advised to avoid strenuous exercise until
noninvasive risk stratification (using either exercise or pharmacologic stress, and echo or nuclear imaging
modalities) is performed in the outpatient setting.
Smoking cessation should be emphasized and aggressive interventions including support groups and
pharmacologic (nicotine and non-nicotine-containing) products are recommended. Similarly, diet and
lipid-lowering therapy should be pursued.[1][2][160] Patients should be informed that blood pressure and
diabetes management must be tightly controlled as appropriate.

Unstable angina Follow up

Monitoring
Monitoring
The duration of cardiac monitoring is generally dictated by the clinical condition, symptoms, presence of
ischemia, and arrhythmias.
The duration of cardiac monitoring after percutaneous coronary intervention depends on the presence
or absence of ongoing ischemia, and hemodynamic or electrical instability. In general after successful
revascularization of all ischemic lesions, monitoring should be continued for >12-24 hours and in cases
without revascularization, it should be continued for >24-48 hours.[108]
Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) should be monitored in the
coronary care unit; however, those with UA (troponin negative) without recurrent or ongoing symptoms
and normal ECG can be monitored on a regular floor.[1]
Low-risk patients are defined by the absence of recurrent chest pain, ECG changes, serum cardiac
markers, and findings of heart failure.[174] These patients should undergo noninvasive testing (using
either exercise or pharmacologic stress, and echo or nuclear imaging modalities) prior to hospital
discharge and require aggressive risk-factor modification.
Patients initially treated conservatively should be reevaluated 2 to 6 weeks after discharge. They should
be assessed for cardiac catheterization and revascularization, based on symptoms and noninvasive
testing.

Unstable angina Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
venous thromboembolism (VTE) short term low
ACS has been associated with an increased risk of VTE, particularly for pulmonary embolism.[173]
congestive heart failure long term high
Congestive heart failure caused by decreased left ventricular (LV) function occurs frequently after ACS
because of myocardial damage, infarct progression, and LV remodeling after the acute episode. Heart
failure post ACS may be more common in females than males.[172]
Appropriate use of drugs, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, and
diuretics, when appropriate, decreases the incidence and progression of congestive heart failure.
Biventricular pacing with or without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator should be considered if
appropriate criteria are met.
recurrent ischemia and infarction variable high
Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) can have recurrent ischemia or infarction caused by further
plaque rupture and progression of atherosclerosis.
Recurrence should be treated in the same manner as the initial presentation.
Aggressive risk factor modification after the initial presentation decreases incidence of recurrences.
depression variable high
Depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for adverse outcomes following ACS.[62] ACS
can also precipitate depression in people without prior psychiatric conditions.[62] [169] [170] Patients
should routinely be screened for depression following a myocardial infarction (MI).[169] Data suggest that
a combined psychosocial approach to the treatment of depression improves outcome in patients. Exercise
combined with pharmacotherapy may be the most efficacious approach.[61] Pharmacotherapy may be
associated with excess risk in patients with residual cardiac dysfunction; cognitive behavioral therapy or
exercise therapy may be more appropriate in this patient group.[171]
Prognosis
Mortality
Overall mortality for the non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patient population is 4.8%
over a 6-month period.[161]
After 6 months, NSTE-ACS population mortality rates exceed those of the ST-elevated myocardial infarction
population.[162]

Unstable angina Follow up
FOLLOW UP
At 12 months, rates of adverse cardiovascular events (recurrent ischemia, myocardial infarction [MI], and
death) are as high as 10% in NSTE-ACS patients, possibly reflecting diffuse active atherosclerotic disease
beyond the initial culprit lesion.[2] [163]
Prognostic factors
Adverse prognostic markers in patients with UA include rest pain, presence of comorbidity (e.g., diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, renal failure), signs of left ventricular failure, ST depression on ECG,
elevated biomarkers, and angiographic findings of left main disease and multivessel disease.[164]
Short-term risk of death or nonfatal MI in patients with UA is related to a number of factors:
• A history of accelerated tempo of ischemic symptoms in the preceding 48 hours
• Prolonged ongoing rest pain >20 minutes
• Pulmonary edema or new mitral regurgitation
• Age >75 years
• ECG findings of ST-T changes, new bundle branch block, sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Risk assessment models
Risk assessment models integrating prognostic markers have been validated as predictor of outcome at 14
days, 30 days, and up to 6 months.[165] [166] [167]
These models for NSTE-ACS short-term outcomes have been shown to maintain predictive value for death
or MI at 1 year.[168]

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
