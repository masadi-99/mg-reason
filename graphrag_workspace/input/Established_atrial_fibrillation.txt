Established atrial fibrillation Overview
Summary
Established atrial fibrillation (AF) is clinically diagnosed “paroxysmal,” “persistent,” “long-standing persistent,”
and “permanent” chaotic and irregular atrial arrhythmia.
Prevalence increases progressively with age.
Patients frequently have coexisting cardiac or noncardiac conditions, such as hypertension, coronary artery
disease, valvular disease, heart failure, obesity, sleep apnea, or pulmonary disease.
Causes significant morbidity (e.g., palpitations, dyspnea, angina, dizziness or syncope, and features of heart
failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or stroke) and death. Many patients are asymptomatic or have
symptoms that are less specific for cardiac arrhythmias, such as mild dementia or silent strokes.
ECG shows absent P waves, presence of fibrillatory waves, and irregularly irregular QRS complexes.
Treatment strategy depends on the severity of symptoms, the duration of AF, and the presence of comorbid
conditions. Treatment involves correction of the abnormal rate, or rate plus rhythm, along with anticoagulation
in high-risk patients.
Risks and benefits of a chosen therapy, such as rate control or rhythm control strategies utilizing beta-
blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmic agents, catheter-based
or surgical ablation for pulmonary vein isolation and left atrial substrate modification, pacemakers, and
ablation of the atrioventricular node need to be weighed based on multiple clinical factors to optimize patient
outcome.
Definition
AF is a supraventricular tachycardia with uncoordinated atrial activation and ineffective atrial contraction.[1]
[2] Diagnosis requires ECG documentation. ECG characteristics include irregularly irregular RR intervals
(where atrioventricular conduction is present); absence of distinct P waves; irregular atrial activations.[1][2]
Atrial fibrillation: P waves are not discernible; the ventricular (QRS complexes) rate is irregularly irregular

Established atrial fibrillation Overview
OVERVIEW
 It is primarily defined based on duration and frequency of episodes; therefore, established AF could be
paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent, and even new onset if detected for the first time.
For details on new-onset AF, please see New-onset atrial fibrillation .
Clinical AF is symptomatic or asymptomatic AF that is documented by surface ECG.
Subclinical AF is detection of the arrhythmia in individuals who do not have symptoms attributable to AF and
in whom there is no previous ECG documenting AF. This includes AF detected by implantable or wearable
devices.
Atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) are defined as events detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices
that exceed the programmed detection rate limit set by the device and can be used to define the burden
of disease in established AF. AHREs require visual inspection to confirm AF and exclude other atrial
arrhythmias, artifact, or oversensing.[1][2]

Established atrial fibrillation Theory
Epidemiology
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia and global incidence and prevalence are increasing.[6]
[7] [8] In 2017, the global prevalence was estimated at 0.51%, an increase of over 30% in 20 years; similarly
the global incidence had also increased by over 30%.[9] 
The prevalence of AF increases with age, from 0.5% at 40 to 50 years to 5% to 15% at 80 years. Men are
more often affected than women.[10] The Rotterdam study found that the lifetime risk of developing AF at
55 years old was 24% in men and 22% in women.[11] In the Framingham and Rotterdam studies, after
adjustment for age and other risk factors, AF occurrence was greater in men than in women but occurrence
was similar in other analyses.[11] [12] [13] The Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly (SAFE) project
reported that the baseline prevalence of AF in participants age over 65 years was 7.2%, with a higher
prevalence in men (7.8%) and people age 75 years or older, with an incidence of 0.69% to 1.64% per year,
depending on screening method.[14] These incidence data refer to cross-sectional study data whereby most
people would have AF lasting >7 days (persistent, paroxysmal, or permanent AF) rather than acute AF. 
 The prevalence and incidence of AF in nonwhite populations is less well studied. The Global Burden of
Disease Study 2017 found that the rates of prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
decreased from 1990 to 2017, but the absolute number of patients with AF, the annual number of new cases,
and DALYs increased.[15] In the US, the prevalence of AF is estimated to increase from approximately 5.2
million in 2010 to 12.1 million in 2030.[16]
Etiology
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with all types of cardiac disease, as well as many noncardiac conditions.
[1]
The conditions most commonly associated with AF include:
• Hypertension
• Coronary artery disease
• Heart failure
• Valvular heart disease
• Diabetes
• Thyroid disease
• Sleep-disordered breathing
• COPD
Other conditions that are associated with AF include:
• Atrial and ventricular dilation or hypertrophy
• Electrophysiologic abnormalities (e.g., sick sinus syndrome)
• Congenital heart disease
• Cardiac or juxtacardiac benign or malignant, primary, or metastatic tumors
• Inflammatory or infiltrative disease (e.g., pericarditis, amyloidosis, myocarditis)
• Age-induced atrial and ventricular fibrosis
• Autonomic neuronal dysfunction
• Alcohol and caffeine misuse
• Noncardiac pulmonary hypertension
• Infections

THEORY
• Chronic kidney disease
In rare cases, AF may be familial or genetic, such as in Lamins A and C heart disease and other familial
cardiomyopathy.[17]
Postoperative AF is common, particularly after cardiac surgery such as transplant, CABG, and valve
replacement.[3] Although most episodes are self-terminating, there is an increased risk of recurrent AF in the
years following the procedure.[3]
Lifestyle factors that increase the risk of AF include smoking, alcohol, obesity, and lack of physical activity.[1]
[2]
Pathophysiology
Since its early description, several theories have evolved in our current understanding of pathophysiologies
of AF.[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Pathophysiology of AF involves multiple etiologies and complex
electrophysiologic changes. AF is usually associated with anatomically and histologically abnormal atria as a
result of underlying heart disease. Dilation of the atria with fibrosis and inflammation causes a difference in
refractory periods within the atrial tissue and promotes electrical reentry that results in AF. The fractionation
of a mother wave into multiple wavelets in the presence of enlarged atria, in conjunction with the short
refractory periods and slow conduction properties of the atria, lead to sustained AF. The presence of rapidly
firing foci, typically in the pulmonary veins, may trigger AF, and this is sustained by fibrillatory conduction or
multiple re-entrant circuits. Clinical cardiovascular disease entities, such as hypertension, congestive heart
failure, and coronary disease, through mechanisms such as myocardial stretch and fibrosis with disruption in
cell-to-cell coupling, can lead to triggers and cellular and electrical remodeling that may promote AF.[1][21]
[25]
Classification
2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and
management of atrial fibrillation[1]
The 2023 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American Association of Colleges of
Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS) guideline classifies AF using stages. This updated
classification recognizes AF as a progressive disease that requires different strategies for management at
different stages, including prevention.
• Stage 1: at risk for AF (presence of risk factors)
• Stage 2: pre-AF (evidence of structural or electrical findings further predisposing patient to AF)
• Stage 3: AF (patients may transition between substages)
• Stage 3A: paroxysmal AF (intermittent, lasting up to 7 days)
• Stage 3B: persistent AF (continuous and sustained for over 7 days and requires intervention)
• Stage 3C: long-standing persistent AF (continuous AF lasting >12 months)
• Stage 3D: successful AF ablation (free from AF after ablation or surgical intervention)
• Stage 4: permanent AF (no further attempts at rhythm control)

Established atrial fibrillation Theory
2020 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of
atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European
Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS)[2]
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) classifies AF in terms of the presentation, duration, and
frequency of episodes:
• First diagnosed/new-onset AF: AF not diagnosed before, irrespective of its duration or the presence/
severity of AF-related symptoms. May be symptomatic or asymptomatic (detected by physical exam or
ECG).[3]
• Paroxysmal AF: AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days
• Persistent AF: AF that is continuously sustained beyond 7 days, including episodes terminated by
cardioversion after 7 days or longer
• Long-standing persistent AF: a subgroup of persistent AF that is continuous for >1 year in duration
• Permanent AF: AF that is refractory to cardioversion and sinus rhythm cannot be restored or
maintained, such that AF is accepted as a final rhythm. A decision has been made by the patient
and physician not to pursue restoration of sinus rhythm by any means, including catheter or surgical
ablation
The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS and ESC guidelines both advise that the following terms are no longer used:[1][2]
• Valvular/nonvalvular AF: the term valvular/nonvalvular AF has been used to differentiate patients with
AF in the presence/absence of moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a prosthetic heart valve. This
terminology may be confusing and should be avoided
• Lone AF: the term "lone AF" has previously been used to identify AF in younger patients without
structural heart disease. However, because definitions are variable, and all patients with AF have
some form of pathophysiologic basis, the term "lone AF" is potentially confusing and should not be
used
• Chronic AF: guidelines now advise that the term "chronic AF" should be abandoned, as it has variable
definitions
Case history
Case history #1
A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and prior
myocardial infarction presents to the emergency department with palpitations and shortness of breath.
These symptoms started 2 days ago. She was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate
response a year and a half ago, at which time an attempted direct current cardioversion and a trial of
sotalol to maintain sinus rhythm and prevent further episodes of AF were unsuccessful. The patient was
treated with digoxin and metoprolol to control rate and warfarin to prevent stroke. Current physical exam
shows that she is febrile and has an irregularly irregular radial pulse at a rate between 90 and 110 beats
per minute, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Heart sounds
are irregular, but no third or fourth heart sound gallop or murmurs are audible. The breath sounds are of
bronchial character associated with crepitations over the left basal lung area.

Established atrial fibrillation Diagnosis
Approach
Patients with established atrial fibrillation (AF) may present with typical symptoms (e.g., palpitations,
shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness), complications of AF (e.g., stroke), or associated
conditions (e.g., features of thyroid disease), or they may be asymptomatic. An ECG usually confirms the
diagnosis. Further investigations include baseline laboratory blood tests and echocardiogram.
Clinical presentation
The most common presenting symptoms of AF are palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue; chest
pain, dizziness, and anxiety occur less frequently.[2][78] [79] AF may also present with symptoms
associated with stroke.[2] [78]
Women and younger patients usually present with palpitations, whereas men are more likely to
be asymptomatic.[79] Black patients report more AF symptoms compared with white or Hispanic
patients.[79]
AF can cause a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy resulting in symptoms of congestive heart failure.[3]
In some cases, due to the rapidity of the ventricular response, cerebral hypoperfusion can result in
presyncope or syncope.
In asymptomatic patients, AF may be incidentally detected during a health check or following an acute
complication, such as stroke. The prevalence of AF in patients with a first-ever ischemic stroke has been
found to be around 15% to 25%.[4] [5]
The past medical and surgical history may be significant for all types of cardiac disease (such as
valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and other
arrhythmias), as well as for many noncardiac conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disease, and cancer.
Risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) should be considered, with screening and diagnosis
where indicated. Although polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosing SDB, home sleep apnea
testing shows promise in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea in most patients with AF.[43]
The modified European Heart Rhythm Association symptom scale can be used to assess and quantify
symptoms before and after initiation of treatment. It evaluates the effect of six symptoms of AF
(palpitations, fatigue, dizziness, dyspnea, chest pain, and anxiety) on the patient’s daily activity.[2]
• Class 1: AF does not cause any symptoms
• Class 2a (mild): normal daily activity not affected by symptoms related to AF
• Class 2b (moderate): normal daily activity not affected by symptoms related to AF, but patient
troubled by symptoms
• Class 3 (severe): normal daily activity affected by symptoms related to AF
• Class 4 (disabling): normal daily activity discontinued.
AF symptoms do not always correlate with objectively measured AF episodes and AF can switch between
symptomatic and asymptomatic even in the same individual.[79]
Multiple studies have shown a clear association between AF and increased risk of cognitive impairment
and dementia.[79] [80] [81][82] [83] This association is independent of whether patients had prior stroke
or not, and whether the dementia is due to Alzheimer disease or vasculopathies.[79] [81] [84] The
pathophysiology and exact mechanisms (e.g., silent microinfarcts, cerebral hypoperfusion and bleed,
ischemic stroke) of AF-related dementia require further evaluation.

DIAGNOSIS
Physical examination
The pulse may be irregularly irregular and rapid but, depending on where the pulse is taken, decreased
perfusion may cause an underestimation of these findings.[2][78] Palpation of the carotids or auscultation
may be necessary. An apparently palpable regular pulse does not exclude AF. It can be extremely difficult
to appreciate irregularity if the pulse rate is very rapid or very slow. The latter may occur in patients
with very poor atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction due to intrinsic AV nodal disease or AV nodal
blocking drugs. In patients with digitalis toxicity, a junctional rhythm may be present in the face of AF. An
apparently irregular pulse does not always indicate AF: for example, other causes of irregular pulse are
frequent premature atrial and/or ventricular complexes in the presence of sinus rhythm, atrial tachycardia,
or atrial flutter. It is therefore necessary to confirm the rhythm with an ECG. Other findings may include
irregular jugular venous pulsations, variation in the intensity of the first heart sound, or absence of a fourth
sound heard previously during sinus rhythm.
There may be physical findings consistent with an underlying cause of AF, such as features of heart
failure, stroke, or an endocrinological problem, such as hyperthyroidism. In an older patient the symptoms
may be as subtle as a decrease in mentation or listlessness.
ECG
An ECG is performed in all patients with possible AF, and is usually confirmatory. P waves are absent
and are replaced by rapid fibrillatory waves, which vary in size, shape, and timing, leading to an irregular
ventricular response when AV conduction is intact.

Atrial fibrillation: P waves are not discernible; “fibrillatory or f waves” of varying amplitudes and very rapid and
irregular rates are particularly seen in lead V1; the ventricular (QRS complexes) rate is irregularly irregular
From the collection of Dr Bharat K. Kantharia
Low-amplitude P waves, such as in an atrial tachycardia, especially multifocal atrial tachycardia that may
be observed in patients with COPD, may mimic AF. In patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices
(CIEDs) such as the permanent pacemakers, AF may be detected as atrial high rate episodes (AHRE).
Like clinical AF, CIED-recorded AHRE need to be confirmed by inspection of stored electrogram events
because some AHRE may be electrical artifacts/false positives.[1] In patients with CIEDs, if surface
ECG shows rapid-paced ventricular rate, underlying AF may not be visible between the paced ventricular
complexes and the diagnosis of AF may be missed. Inconsistent premature atrial contractions can impart
an irregular ventricular rhythm that at times may be called AF by the ECG diagnostic algorithms.
ECG can also be used to screen for a preexcitation syndrome, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
See Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome .
Other rhythms that need to be excluded are counterclockwise atrial flutter, clockwise atrial flutter, and
multifocal atrial tachycardia. Where diagnostic uncertainty remains, the use of Holter monitoring or an
event recorder (e.g., Cardiomemo) may also be required.[1] [78]

Mobile health technologies, including smart devices, have become a popular research area for AF
detection.[85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] A large number of mobile health apps and wearable activity monitors
are available, but many are not clinically validated and caution is advised for clinical use.[1] [2] If AF is
detected by mobile or wearable devices, diagnosis should be confirmed with single-lead or 12-lead ECG
analyzed by a physician with expertise in ECG rhythm interpretation.[1] [2]

Established atrial fibrillation Diagnosis
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiogram may be performed after the 12-lead ECG, and is important to exclude
important cardiac pathologies and risk factors for persistent AF, such as valvular and pericardial disease
and cardiomyopathies.[1] [2] Furthermore, it can suggest left atrial thrombus. However, absence of
thrombi in the left atrium by a transthoracic echocardiogram does not rule them out. In order to exclude
left atrial thrombi, it is mandatory to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram as opposed to a
transthoracic echocardiogram, because this test is more accurate at detecting left atrial thrombi. All
patients who need cardioversion, and have unknown or suboptimal anticoagulation profile, should have a
transesophageal echocardiogram first to exclude left atrial thrombus.
Laboratory evaluation
Thyroid function tests should be done in all patients presenting with AF. Hyperthyroidism can be
diagnosed with laboratory work and treated appropriately with medication, radioablative therapy, or
surgery. Diagnosing thyrotoxicosis is also important when the ventricular rate is difficult to control.[1]
[2] Furthermore, cardiomyopathy related to thyrotoxicosis may reverse completely upon treatment of
thyrotoxicosis. Routine biochemistry including serum electrolytes plus serum magnesium, blood urea
nitrogen, and liver aminotransferases should be done to assess for the presence of other comorbid
conditions, and to assess electrolyte and metabolic status. These tests are also helpful in choosing
antiarrhythmic agents and their dosages. Screening for diabetes mellitus should also be considered.
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
presence of cardiovascular risk factors (common)
• Key cardiovascular risk factors for AF include hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart
failure, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and presence of other arrhythmias.
presence of noncardiovascular risk factors (common)
• Key noncardiovascular risk factors for AF include conditions such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease,
alcohol misuse, and certain cancers (e.g., primary lung cancer involving the pleura and pericardium;
breast cancer and malignant melanoma metastasizing to the pericardium). AF can also develop during
cancer treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.[59]
palpitations (common)
• Common symptom, although some patients are asymptomatic.
tachycardia (common)
• Most patients have tachycardia if not already taking a rate-controlling medication.
irregular pulse (common)
• Over 90% of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) have irregular pulse on palpation.
However, an apparently regular pulse does not exclude AF. It can be extremely difficult to appreciate

Other diagnostic factors
stroke (common)
• As a complication of atrial fibrillation (AF).
• Studies evaluating patients with a first-ever ischemic stroke have found a high (15% to 25%)
prevalence of AF.[4] [5]
• Studies assessing prolonged ECG monitoring (using a 30-day event-triggered recorder or an
insertable cardiac monitoring device) in patients with cryptogenic stroke have found AF to be common
in these patients.[92] [93]
shortness of breath (uncommon)
• Patients may present with dyspnea due to atrial fibrillation-related cardiomyopathy.
fatigue (uncommon)
• Patients may present with fatigue due to atrial fibrillation-related cardiomyopathy.
chest pain (uncommon)
• Patients may present with anginal chest pain due to concomitant CAD.
dizziness (uncommon)
• The reasons for dizziness are several. Due to loss of atrial kick and resultant decline in the stroke
volume, patients with stiff ventricles and diastolic dysfunction in particular may experience dizziness.
• Patients may also develop dizziness due to thromboembolic events, or due to poor cerebral perfusion,
especially if they have concomitant cerebrovascular disease.
syncope (uncommon)
• Patients may present with syncope.[91]
hypotension (uncommon)
• Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate may cause hemodynamic instability.
elevated jugular venous pressure (uncommon)
• A feature of associated heart failure.
murmur or gallop rhythm (uncommon)
• Murmurs associated with underlying valvular disease, such as mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart
disease, may be audible. A gallop rhythm may be heard in heart failure.
rales (uncommon)
• A feature of associated heart failure.

decrease in mentation or listlessness (uncommon)
• In an older patient the symptoms may be as subtle as a decrease in mentation or listlessness. Multiple
studies have shown a clear association between atrial fibrillation and increased risk of cognitive
impairment and dementia.[80] This association is independent of whether patients had prior stroke or
not, and whether dementia is due to Alzheimer disease or vasculopathies.[84]
Risk factors
Strong
hypertension
• Hypertension is a strong established risk factor for development of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is a
common comorbidity.[12] [26] [27] [28] In the Framingham study, hypertension was significantly
associated with risk of AF in men and women (odds ratios 1.5 and 1.4 respectively).[27] Increased
systolic and diastolic blood pressure in what is considered within the normal range has also been
associated with increased risk of developing AF.[28] Likely mechanisms may be related to the effect of
pressure and myocardial stretch on the electrophysiologic characteristics in the atrial muscle.
coronary artery disease (CAD)
• CAD and AF share common risk factors and are common comorbidities.[29] Presence of CAD
increases the risk of developing AF.[30]
congestive heart failure
• Heart failure and AF often coexist, and the two conditions may cause or exacerbate each other.[2]
 Heart failure is a powerful predictor of the occurrence of AF, being diagnosed in as many as 35% of
patients, and this may be an underestimate.[31] The mechanisms are related to atrial stretch-mediated
effects. AF occurs more commonly in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.[3] The
presence of AF in patients with heart failure is associated with a worse prognosis.[3]
advancing age
• Prevalence increases dramatically with advancing age for both sexes (odds ratio of 2.1 for men and
2.2 for women for each decade of advancing age); at least double after age 50 years.[27]
diabetes mellitus
• Diabetes mellitus is significantly associated with risk of AF in both sexes (odds ratio 1.4 for men
and 1.6 for women).[27] The presence of diabetes in patients with AF has been associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.[32]
valvular disease
• Valvular heart disease is found in 33% of patients with AF.[3] Strong association with rheumatic
heart disease, especially mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation. In the Framingham study, valve
disease was significantly associated with risk of AF in men and women (odds ratios 1.8 and 3.4
respectively).[27]
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Around 20% to 25% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also have AF.[3]

alcohol misuse
• Excessive amounts of alcohol acutely or moderate amounts over a long period, particularly if
associated with a cardiomyopathy, are associated with an increased risk of AF.[33] [34] The
associations are variably reported but several studies suggest a relationship.[35] [36] [37] It can also
be seen with withdrawal symptoms.[38] [39]
presence of other arrhythmias
• AF may also result as degeneration of other rapid arrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter,
or atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia.
smoking
• Smoking is associated with the incidence of AF, with more than a twofold increased risk of AF
attributed to current smoking.[3]
• Among smokers who quit, there is a trend toward a lower incidence of AF compared with those who
continue to smoke.
• In the large prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, participants were followed-up
for over a mean of 13.1 years.[40] Compared with never smokers, the multivariable-adjusted hazard
ratios for AF were 1.32 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.57) in former smokers, 2.05 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.47) in current
smokers, and 1.58 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.85) in ever smokers. Associations were similar by sex, race, and
type of AF. People who quit smoking exhibited a trend indicating a slightly lower risk of developing AF
compared with those who continued to smoke.[40]
obesity
• Abdominal adiposity and higher body fat mass have been shown to increase the risk of AF.[41] Obesity
is estimated to account for one fifth of AF cases; weight gain and a higher midlife body mass index are
strongly correlated with AF.[42]
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)
• SDB, comprising obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea, and Cheyne-Stokes breathing,
is strongly associated with AF.[43]
• The prevalence of OSA among people with AF is estimated at 50% or higher.[44] OSA and AF share
common risk factors (e.g., age, male sex, obesity, hypertension, and heart failure).[43] [45] There is
mounting evidence for a cause-effect relationship between SDB and AF; for example, the VARIOSA-
AF cohort study (Variability of Sleep Apnea Severity and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation) showed that ≥1 hour
of AF was twice as likely the day after nights with the highest SDB severity compared with nights with
the lowest SDB severity. Conversely, AF did not predict respiratory disturbances.[43] [46] Sustained
physiologic stresses associated with SDB, including disturbed sleep, autonomic fluctuations, and
repetitive hypoxia and hypercapnia, are thought to interact with circadian mechanisms to remodel
the structure and electrophysiologic function of the heart over time, increasing the risk of rhythm
disorders.[43] Use of continuous positive airway pressure in patients with OSA is associated with
a reduced risk of recurrent AF after catheter ablation.[47] However, there is a need for high-quality
randomized clinical trial evidence in this area.[43] See Obstructive sleep apnea , Central sleep apnea .
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
• COPD is present in 10% to 15% of patients with AF and is an independent predictor of AF progression
from paroxysmal to permanent.[3]

chronic kidney disease (CKD)
• CKD is present in up to 50% of patients with AF.[2] [48] Proposed mechanisms include a generalized
pro-inflammatory state and the pathologic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
leading to atrial remodeling.[3] AF is particularly common in patients undergoing hemodialysis.[3]
sedentary lifestyle
• Physical inactivity may be an independent risk factor for AF.[49]
thyroid disease
• About 10% to 15% of patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis develop AF.[50] [51] [52]
• Suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone alone is a risk factor for AF. In the older population,
hyperthyroidism may not be clinically evident (apathetic hyperthyroidism) and AF may be a clinical sign
of this entity.[50] [52]
• One meta-analysis found that subclinical hyperthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and clinical
hyperthyroidism were all associated with an increased risk of AF.[53]
Weak
autonomic neuronal dysfunction
• Increased parasympathetic tone is linked to the occurrence of AF, as it heterogeneously reduces the
atrial effective refractory period and predisposes to reentry.[18] [54] [55] [56] Investigational drugs that
block certain potassium channels regulated by acetylcholine suppressed AF in certain experimental
models. Data from catheter ablation procedures suggest better long-term outcomes with denervation
of parasympathetic ganglia near the pulmonary veins.
caffeine misuse
• Can be a risk factor in susceptible people.
cancer
• Patients with cancer have an increased risk of developing AF, and the risk may depend on type of
cancer.[57] [58]
• AF may also develop in patients undergoing cancer treatment, particularly in those ≥65 years and/
or with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.[59] Cancer surgery is associated with AF, with the
highest rate reported for lung surgery.[59] In addition, patients who have had radiation therapy to
the mediastinum for cancers such as Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are prone to AF. Many
chemotherapy agents are also associated with the development of AF, for example, tyrosine kinase
inhibitors.[59] [60]
working long hours
• One prospective multi-cohort study found that people who worked long hours (≥55 hours per week)
were more likely to develop AF than those working standard hours (35-40 hours per week).[61]
excessive exercise
• Moderate exercise appears to be beneficial; however, extreme levels of exercise may be associated
with a higher risk of AF.[49] [62] There is a fivefold increase in lifetime risk of AF in athletes.[3]

height
• Taller individuals are likely to be at increased risk of AF. Likely mechanisms are related to the larger
left atrial size that is associated with tall stature.[63] In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, height was
found to be a risk factor for incident AF, with 35% to 65% higher risk of AF per 10 cm difference in
height.[64]
air pollution
• Studies have suggested an association between exposure to air pollution and an increased incidence
of AF.[65] [66]

• Studies suggest that there is an association between migraine with aura and incidence of AF in
otherwise healthy individuals.[67]

Test Result
ECG
• The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) requires ECG documentation
by at least a single-lead recording during the episode of
arrhythmia.[1] [2] This test is very accurate in detecting persistent
AF. However, where diagnostic uncertainty remains or if rate control
needs further evaluation, Holter monitoring or an event recorder (e.g.,
Cardiomemo) may also be required.[1] [78]
Atrial fibrillation: P waves are not discernible; the
ventricular (QRS complexes) rate is irregularly irregular
From the collection of Dr Arti N. Shah
• Low-amplitude P waves such as in an atrial tachycardia, especially
multifocal atrial tachycardia that may be observed in patients with
COPD, may mimic AF.
• In patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such
as the permanent pacemakers, AF may be detected as atrial high
rate episodes (AHREs). Like clinical AF, CIED-recorded AHRE need
to be confirmed by inspection of stored electrogram events because
some AHREs may be electrical artifacts/false positives. In patients
with CIEDs, if surface ECG shows rapid-paced ventricular rate,
underlying AF may not be visible between the paced ventricular
complexes and the diagnosis of AF may be missed.
• ECG can also be used to screen for a preexcitation syndrome, such
as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Screening
Stroke may be the initial presentation of atrial fibrillation (AF). Studies evaluating patients with a first-ever
ischemic stroke have found the prevalence of AF to be 15% to 25%.[4] [5] Furthermore, studies assessing
prolonged ECG monitoring (using a 30-day event-triggered recorder or an insertable cardiac monitoring
device) in patients with cryptogenic stroke have found AF to be common in these patients.[92] [93] Therefore,
strategies for primary preventative screening for AF in patients at high risk of stroke can be considered.
There is no expert consensus or guideline recommendation on screening patients with asymptomatic
AF. The US Preventive Services Task Force advises that current evidence is insufficient to assess the
balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF.[94] However, screening for AF can be performed in
patients implanted with a pacemaker or defibrillator. In an observational study involving patients receiving
an implantable pacemaker, new-onset AF and long-term AF burden were frequently observed in patients
with heart block or sinus node disease, but were significantly more predominant in patients with sinus node
disease in whom AF is part of the syndrome.[95]
Patients undergoing cancer treatment are at higher risk of AF, and should have an ECG as part of a baseline
cardiovascular risk assessment.[59] Those at higher risk, for example those on certain chemotherapy agents,
should be screened with more regular ECGs and/or opportunistic pulse taking.[59]
Mobile health technologies, including smart devices, have become a popular research area for AF
detection.[85] [86] A large number of mobile health apps and wearable activity monitors are available, but
many are not clinically validated and caution is advised for clinical use.[1][2] If AF is detected by mobile or
wearable devices, diagnosis should be confirmed with single-lead or 12-lead ECG analyzed by a physician
with expertise in ECG rhythm interpretation.[1][2]

Established atrial fibrillation Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The main elements in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) are:
• Ventricular rate control
• Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm
• Prevention of stroke and thromboembolic events
• Lifestyle and risk factor modification
The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent tachycardia-induced
cardiomyopathy and thromboembolic events. Treatment involves correction of the abnormal rate/rhythm,
along with anticoagulation.
Factors in the patient's presentation and diagnostic assessment that guide appropriate treatment include the
following:
• Whether the patient is hemodynamically stable or unstable
• If hemodynamically stable, whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic
• The presence of associated heart failure (HF) or other comorbidities
• The presence of a thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
• If a thrombus is absent on TEE, whether the patient has a high or low thromboembolic risk.
The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends following the integrated Atrial fibrillation Better Care
(ABC) pathway for holistic management of any patient with AF:[2] [98]
• A: Anticoagulation/avoid stroke
• B: Better symptom management (rate/rhythm control)
• C: Cardiovascular and comorbidity optimization (including lifestyle changes)
Need for hospital admission
Patients with comorbidity may require hospital admission. In particular, admission to the hospital is
indicated for:
• Patients with underlying heart disease who have hemodynamic consequences or symptoms of
angina, heart failure, or syncope or who are at risk for a complication resulting from therapy of the
arrhythmia.
• Patients with associated or precipitant medical conditions that require further treatment, such
as heart failure, pulmonary problems (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism), hypertension, or
hyperthyroidism.
Hospital admission should also be considered on an individual case basis for older patients.
Hemodynamically unstable AF
Patients with established AF may present acutely with hemodynamic instability. This may occur following
a change in clinical situation; for example, exacerbation of heart failure, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia,
metabolic abnormalities, etc. AF with a rapid ventricular rate causing ongoing chest pain, hypotension,
shortness of breath, dizziness, or syncope requires immediate direct current (DC) cardioversion.[3] This
is performed under adequate short-acting general anesthesia and involves delivery of an electrical shock
synchronized with the intrinsic activity of the heart by sensing the R wave of the ECG (i.e., synchronized).
Most currently used external defibrillators utilize biphasic energy, and as low as 100 J may be used as

Established atrial fibrillation Management
the starting level for the successful termination of AF. However, energy from 200 J to a maximum of 400 J
may be used, depending on body size and the presence of other comorbid conditions. 
Hemodynamically stable AF
In hemodynamically stable patients, in addition to review of lifestyle and risk factors and assessment of
stroke risk, a clinical decision on initial management needs to be made as to whether to follow a primarily
rate-control or rhythm-control strategy. A rate-control strategy aims to control the ventricular rate, but
with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm. A rhythm-control strategy attempts to restore
and maintain sinus rhythm using approaches including pharmacologic therapy, electrical cardioversion,
and catheter or surgical ablation. The treatment strategy depends on the severity and duration of the
symptoms and is individualized for each patient.[1] [2]
Decisions on anticoagulation and rate-control versus rhythm-control strategy should be made with the
patient, following discussion of options.
Lifestyle and risk factor modification
US guidelines recommend that all patients with AF receive comprehensive guideline-directed lifestyle
and risk factor modification, which includes maintenance of ideal weight and weight loss if overweight or
obese, having a physically active lifestyle, reducing unhealthy alcohol consumption, stopping smoking,
controlling diabetes, and controlling blood pressure/hypertension.[1]
Prevention of stroke and thromboembolism: anticoagulation
The patient's risk of stroke and thromboembolic events should be assessed using a validated clinical risk
score, such as the CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool.[1] [2] [78] Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association/American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society
(ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS) recommend that the risk is evaluated annually.[1] The CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool, a
modified version of the CHADS₂ tool, is the most validated risk score and is generally preferred.[1] [2] [78]
 CHA₂DS₂-VASc allocates 1 point each for chronic heart failure, hypertension, age 65-74 years, diabetes
mellitus, vascular disease, and female sex, and 2 points each for a history of stroke or transient ischemic
attack, or age 75 years and older.[99]  The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS and ESC guidelines recommend the
use of oral anticoagulants for patients with AF and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women
(which corresponds to annual thromboembolic risk of ≥2%).[1] [2] With a score of ≥1 in men or ≥2 in
women (which corresponds to annual thromboembolic risk of ≥1% to <2%), the use of oral anticoagulants
to prevent thromboembolic stroke can be considered; additional factors that may modify stroke risk, such
as hypertension control, can be taken into account.[1] [2] Use of oral anticoagulants in patients with a
nonsex-related CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 is particularly important to consider in patients over the age of
65 years.[3] 
Newer stroke risk scores that have been validated include GARFIELD-AF  [GARFIELD-AF Risk
Calculator] (https://af.garfieldregistry.org/garfield-af-risk-calculator)  and ATRIA  [ATRIA Stroke Risk
Score] (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1842/atria-stroke-risk-score)  
Use of any anticoagulation strategy needs to be balanced with the risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial
bleeding.[100] Scoring systems such as ORBIT, HAS-BLED, HEMORR₂HAGES, and the newer direct
oral anticoagulants (DOAC) score can help to quantify this risk and assess how the bleeding risk can be
minimized.[101]  [MdCalc. HEMORR₂HAGES Score for Major Bleeding Risk] (https://www.mdcalc.com/
calc/1785/hemorr2hages-score-major-bleeding-risk)   When used in combination with a stroke risk
score such as CHA₂DS₂-VASc, bleeding risk tools provide a means to balance the benefits and risks of

anticoagulation with patients. Bleeding risk scores should not be used to exclude people from receiving
anticoagulant treatment.[1] [2] [102]
In patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as the permanent pacemakers and
defibrillators, AF may be detected as atrial high rate episodes (AHREs). AHREs can be silent, (i.e., not
causing or correlating with symptoms [subclinical AF]) and vary in duration. Anticoagulation therapy for
prevention of thromboembolism and stroke based on subclinical AF has not shown to be convincingly
useful; use of DOACs in the ARTESIA and NOAH-AF trials was associated with increased risk of major
bleeding.[103] [104] In patients who have longer duration AHREs, are at higher risk of stroke (e.g.,
measured by CHA₂DS₂-VASc), and have symptomatic AF, anticoagulation may be of benefit.[1] [2] [105]
Oral anticoagulation drugs for stroke prevention are warfarin or a DOAC such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
apixaban, or edoxaban. All patients should preferably be started on a DOAC, unless they are not eligible
(e.g., presence of moderate to severe mitral valve stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or DOACs
are not available.[1] [2] [78] Unlike warfarin, DOACs are nonvitamin K-dependent. While dabigatran is an
oral direct thrombin inhibitor, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit factor Xa directly. All DOACs
have consistently shown safety and efficacy compared with warfarin in large, randomized clinical trials for
stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF.[3] [106]
• Dabigatran was compared with warfarin in patients with AF at increased risk of stroke in the RE-
LY trial that included 18,113 patients and had a median follow-up of 2 years.[107] Compared
with warfarin, dabigatran at a lower dose showed noninferiority and, at higher doses, it showed
superiority regarding rates of stroke and systemic embolism (warfarin 1.69%/year, lower dose
dabigatran 1.53%/year, and higher dose dabigatran 1.11%/year for a primary end point of stroke
and systemic embolism). Adverse bleeding event rates were lower with a lower dose and similar
with a higher dose of dabigatran compared with warfarin. Although there was significantly higher
rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding with higher dose of dabigatran, intracranial bleeding was
significantly lower with both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin.[107]
• Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in
patients with nonvalvular AF in the ROCKET AF (14,264 patients and a median follow-up of 1.9
years), ARISTOTLE (18,201 patients and a median follow-up of 1.8 years), and ENGAGE AF
(21,105 patients and a median follow-up of 2.8 years) trials, respectively. The primary end point
of stroke and/or systemic embolism end points were 1.7% per year with rivaroxaban compared
with 2.2% per year with warfarin in the ROCKET AF, 1.27% per year with apixaban compared with
1.6% per year with warfarin in ARISTOTLE, and 1.61% per year with a lower dose and 1.18% per
year a higher dose edoxaban compared with 1.50% per year with warfarin in ENGAGE AF trials,
respectively.[108] [109] [110] [111]
These trials, together with results of meta-analyses, have shown that DOACs are noninferior to warfarin
for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF, and may be associated with a reduced risk of fatal
bleeding.[106] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] It is, therefore, reasonable to use a DOAC as a first-line agent
or subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients with AF. DOACs are generally safe in older patients;
however, dabigatran may be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with
warfarin.[117]
If DOACs are used in patients with renal impairment, they should be used with caution. Some DOACs
may require a dose adjustment and others are not recommended, depending on the degree of renal
impairment and the indication for use. Consult a drug information source for specific guidance on use
in patients with renal impairment. Regular monitoring, including complete blood count, renal function,

and liver function, is recommended. DOACs should not be in combination with heparin (including low
molecular weight heparin [LMWH]), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.
The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality of
anticoagulation control as reflected by the average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2 to 3. The
SAMe-TT₂R₂ scoring system (based on sex, age, medical history, treatment interactions, tobacco use,
and race) is a tool that may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients who are less likely to maintain
TTR >70% and who should, therefore, be managed with DOACs instead of warfarin.[118] [119]  [SAMe-
TT₂R₂ score] (http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/resources/tools/same-tt2r2.html) 
The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS, ESC, and NICE (UK) guidelines do not recommend aspirin as an alternative
to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with AF.[1] [2] [78]
Adults with AF who are prescribed anticoagulation should discuss the options with their healthcare
professional at least once per year.[1] [78]
Anticoagulation treatment in AF may reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.[120] One
meta-analysis found that use of oral anticoagulants was associated with a significant reduction in
cognitive impairment in patients with AF, and that DOACs had a more protective effect compared
with warfarin.[121] Currently, no unique score system is available for the risk stratification of patients
with AF and dementia. Many physicians tend to use CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores as surrogate or extended
methodology for dementia risk-stratification. Some investigators have used components of some
commonly performed blood tests independently and integrated with CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores to risk stratify
dementia. However, much work is still needed in developing simple, easy, and widely applicable risk-
stratifying systems for AF-related dementia.[122]
Recommendations for anticoagulation in patients with concomitant conditions are available and should
be consulted.[1] [2] See “Considerations for management of specific comorbidities” below for specific
examples.
Prevention of stroke and thromboembolism: left atrial appendage
occlusion and exclusion
Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may be considered as an alternative for stroke
prevention when there are absolute contraindications to use of anticoagulants, or the risk of bleeding
outweighs the benefits.[1] [2] [78] [123][124] 
LAAO devices such as the WATCHMAN™ and the Amplatzer™ Cardiac Plug device may be implanted
percutaneously via transeptal catheterization. The WATCHMAN™ device has a polyethylene membrane
that covers a self-expanding nitinol cage with barbs to anchor the device in the left atrial appendage
(LAA). In the PROTECT AF trial, the primary efficacy event rate (a composite end point of stroke,
cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism) of the WATCHMAN™ device was considered noninferior
to that of warfarin.[125] There was a higher rate of adverse safety events in the intervention group
than in the control group, due mainly to periprocedural complications. The Amplatzer™ Cardiac Plug
consists of a small proximal disk, a central polyester patch, and a larger distal disk with hooks to anchor
the device in the LAA. It does not require anticoagulation and a European trial found a 96% success
rate for deployment/implantation but with a 7% incidence of serious complications.[126] Another
nonpharmacologic approach to isolate and occlude LAA is to tie off the LAA using the LARIAT device,
which is an epicardial snare.[127] The WATCHMAN FLX™ device is a next-generation LAA closure
device that has a greater number of struts and dual-row J-shaped anchors to maximize device stability.

MANAGEMENT
A prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study (PINNACLE FLX) found the WATCHMAN FLX™ to be
associated with a low incidence of adverse events and a high incidence of anatomic closure.[128]
Concomitant surgical LAA exclusion may be considered (in addition to continued anticoagulation)
in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2 or equivalent stroke risk who are undergoing cardiac
surgery (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft or valve surgery).[1] The safety and efficacy of concomitant
surgical LAAO in patients with AF undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication was evaluated in
a multicenter, randomized trial (Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study [LAAOS III]). Participants had a
mean age of 71 years and a mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 4.2 and most continued to receive ongoing
antithrombotic therapy. The risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower in the group who had
concomitant LAAO performed during the surgery than the group who didn’t at a mean follow-up of 3.8
years.[129]
In a decision-analytic Markov model designed to simulate a virtual clinical trial of stroke prevention
strategies (DOACs and LAAO), it was shown that the clinical benefit of LAAO over DOACs depends on
patients' baseline risks for stroke and bleeding. Although LAAOs were favorable among patients with the
highest bleeding risk (higher HAS-BLED scores), that benefit became less certain at higher stroke risk
(higher CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores).[130] [131]
Rate-control strategy
Pharmacologic rate control:
• A rate-control strategy may be preferred over rhythm control in older patients who have a longer
history of AF and fewer symptoms.[1] [2] Older patients (>70 years) are more prone to drug
interactions and proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs, such as exacerbation of underlying
sinus node dysfunction.[132] [133] [134] [135] Additionally, rate control is also generally preferred
in patients who have a larger left atrium, less left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, less atrioventricular
regurgitation, and an easily controlled heart rate. Aggressive rate control with pharmacologic
agents may result in significant depression of the left ventricular systolic function. In some patients
who have slow resting heart rates, drug therapy could be hazardous. A lenient rate-control strategy
(resting heart rate <110 bpm) may be reasonable as long as patients remain asymptomatic and
left ventricular systolic function is preserved. The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS and European Society of
Cardiology guidelines support lenient rate control (resting heart rate of <100 to <110 bpm) for target
rate control therapy, but this should be guided by underlying patient symptoms.[1] [2]
• Patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF with rapid ventricular response requiring acute rate control
are treated with either beta-blocker, a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem or
verapamil, if ejection fraction [EF] >40%), digoxin, or amiodarone.[1] [2]
• In terms of choosing a single drug or combination of these drugs, consider any comorbid
conditions, the presence or absence of heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF).
• When LV function is preserved, a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel
blocker is preferred. The beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, propranolol, and
bisoprolol may be used orally. In patients with HF, carvedilol is effective in rate control, and
in combination with digoxin may improve LV function. Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel
blockers must not be used in the presence of HF with reduced EF (≤40%) owing to their
negative inotropic effect.

Established atrial fibrillation Management
• Digoxin is not considered a first-line agent for the purpose of rate control, but it can be
useful (either alone or in combination) when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated. One study explored whether digoxin use
was independently associated with increased mortality in patients with AF. Compared with
propensity score-matched control participants, the risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]:
1.78; 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.31) and sudden death (adjusted HR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.11 to 4.12) was
significantly higher in new digoxin users. In patients with AF taking digoxin, the risk of death
was independently related to serum digoxin concentration and was highest in patients with
concentrations of at least 1.2 nanograms/mL.[136]
• Amiodarone may be considered for acute rate control in patients who are critically ill or in
decompensated heart failure when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel
blockers are ineffective or contraindicated.[1] [2]
• Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (if EF >40%) may also be used for
long-term rate control, with digoxin considered either alone or in combination if other options are
not tolerated or contraindicated.[1] [2]
• Beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, and digoxin may be used in conjunction with drugs typically
used for heart failure, such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors. It should be remembered that a rapid
rate itself could contribute to heart failure symptoms, and continuing or increasing beta-blockers
may be appropriate rather than contraindicated in these patients as long as other medications such
as diuretics are adjusted accordingly.
Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) and pacing:
• AVNA and pacemaker implantation may be considered for rate control when rapid ventricular
response is refractory to pharmacologic rate control and attempt at rhythm control has either been
unsuccessful, or the patient is not eligible for rhythm control.[1] [2]
• This "ablate and pace" strategy involves ablation of the AV junction and implantation of a
permanent ventricular pacemaker therapy. Atrial lead implantation in those with paroxysmal AF, a
coronary sinus lead in those with ventricular dyssynchrony, and even a defibrillator lead in those at
risk of sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias may be necessary. The ablate and pace
strategy provides an improvement in symptoms, better rate control, and reduces adverse events of
uncontrolled heart rate on left ventricular function (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy), especially
in patients in whom rate control with multiple pharmacologic agents proves difficult.[137] [138] [139]
[140] 
Rhythm-control strategy
A rhythm control strategy aims to restore and maintain sinus rhythm using approaches including
pharmacologic therapy, electrical cardioversion, and catheter or surgical ablation.[1] A rhythm control
strategy may be preferred over rate control in younger patients who have a shorter history of AF and a
higher symptom burden.[1] [2] [141] Additionally, rhythm control may be preferred in patients who have
a smaller left atrium, greater left ventricular dysfunction, greater atrioventricular regurgitation, and a less
easily controlled heart rate.[1]
In the Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET4), patients diagnosed
with AF within the last 12 months were randomized to receive either early rhythm control therapy or
usual care. Patients in the early rhythm control group received antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation,
as well as cardioversion of persistent AF, early after randomization. Patients receiving usual care were
initially treated with rate-control therapy without rhythm-control therapy and only received rhythm-control
therapy for uncontrolled symptoms. The trial was stopped early (at 5 years follow-up) for efficacy. The

MANAGEMENT
primary outcome, a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, hospitalization for heart
failure, or acute coronary syndrome, occurred in 249 patients in the early rhythm control group (3.9/100
person-years) and in 316 patients in the usual care group (5.0/100 person-years).[142] Prespecified
subanalysis found that the primary cardiovascular outcomes continued to be reduced with early rhythm
control in patients with a high comorbidity burden (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥4), but not in those with fewer
comorbidities.[143] A population-based cohort study in Korea found that a benefit of early rhythm control
among low-risk patients who would not have been eligible for EAST-AFNET4 (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 0 to
1).[144] One meta-analysis (which included EAST-AFNET4) found that early initiation of rhythm control
therapy was associated with improved outcomes (a composite of death, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke,
hospitalization with HF, or acute coronary syndrome) in patients who had been diagnosed with AF within
1 year.[145] A follow-up study of EAST-AFNET4 suggested that the efficacy of early rhythm control is
mediated by the presence of sinus rhythm at 12 months.[146] 
Compared with a rate-control strategy, restoring the sinus rhythm reduces the possibility of embolic
stroke due to clot formation in the left atrium. Long-term anticoagulation for stroke prevention may not
be necessary in the rhythm-control group. However, one should be cautious in assuming that rhythm
control is always effective. Recurrences are common, and asymptomatic AF is frequent when patients
have been followed after AF ablations clinically and with cardiac implantable electronic devices. Even
though there may be electrical sinus rhythm, mechanical function may not be adequate, and stasis and
the other causes of thrombus formation may still exist. The decision to continue with anticoagulation and
type used should take into account the risks of the therapy and the risk for stroke. Attention to rate control,
even when in sinus rhythm, is also necessary.
Cardioversion
DC cardioversion is indicated to restore sinus rhythm in patients with hemodynamic instability from AF.
Either DC cardioversion or pharmacologic cardioversion can be considered in hemodynamically stable
patients.[1] DC cardioversion is quicker and more effective than pharmacologic cardioversion and is
generally preferred, but it requires sedation.
Both DC and pharmacologic cardioversion are associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events,
and risk must be minimized before going ahead.[147] [148]
• If cardioversion is indicated for an episode of AF ≥48 hours or of unknown duration, it must be
performed only after a minimum of 3 weeks on oral anticoagulation (DOAC or warfarin), or after
imaging to rule out presence of intracardiac thrombus (e.g., if patient has had previous LAAO and
is not receiving anticoagulation).[1]
• If the duration of AF is <48 hours, cardioversion is generally thought to have a low risk of
thromboembolic events with anticoagulation afterward; however, imaging to rule out the presence
of an intracardiac thrombus may be considered before cardioversion, particularly in those who have
not received a minimum of 3 weeks on oral anticoagulation and those at higher thromboembolic
risk.[1] The benefit of pericardioversion anticoagulation or imaging in patients with a low risk of
thromboembolism and AF duration <12 hours is uncertain.[1] AF that is asymptomatic before the
immediate event is common, making a determination of the duration uncertain.
• Guidelines recommend that therapeutic anticoagulation is started before cardioversion and
continued for at least 4 weeks afterward.[1]
• If intracardiac thrombus is identified on imaging and cardioversion is delayed, anticoagulation
is given for a minimum of 3-6 weeks and imaging repeated before cardioversion is considered
again.[1]

Established atrial fibrillation Management
In patients with hemodynamically stable persistent AF with preserved left ventricular function and no
evidence of metabolic and electrolyte disturbances, pharmacologic cardioversion may be attempted with
administration of intravenous ibutilide under close telemetry monitoring.[1] Ibutilide prolongs repolarization
of the atrial tissue by enhancing the slow inward depolarizing sodium current in the plateau phase of
repolarization. For cardioversion of acute AF and atrial flutter to sinus rhythm, ibutilide is very efficacious;
the conversion rate of persistent lasting for more than 30 days is approximately 48%.[149] Because the
half-life of ibutilide is 3-6 hours, prolonged observation period is recommended in patients who have
received ibutilide.[150] [151] Intravenous amiodarone is also an option for pharmacologic cardioversion
(including patients with HF), but time to cardioversion is longer than with ibutilide.[1] [2] Intravenous
procainamide, if available, may be considered for pharmacologic cardioversion (in patients who do not
have HF with reduced EF) when other intravenous agents are contraindicated.[1]
Pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs may be considered in some patients to facilitate the success of
DC cardioversion and reduce risk of AF recurrence.[150] [151]
If pharmacologic conversion is attempted and is unsuccessful, DC conversion should be considered
rather than switching to an alternative antiarrhythmic agent.[1]
Selected outpatients who have recurrent AF may self-administer a single oral dose of flecainide or
propafenone (known as the "pill-in-the-pocket" approach).[1] [2] An atrioventricular node-blocking agent
(beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) should be administered concomitantly, to
prevent atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. Safety and efficacy of this approach in selected patients should
be established first in a monitored hospital setting.[1] [2]
Pharmacologic maintenance of sinus rhythm
Long-term use of antiarrhythmic drugs is considered for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion
in patients in whom catheter ablation is not suitable or not preferred. Pharmacologic maintenance of
sinus rhythm can also be considered while awaiting ablation. Adverse effects associated with use of
antiarrhythmics include bradycardia or worsening of underlying sinus node dysfunction, or AV block.
There is a risk of other arrhythmias developing with the use of these antiarrhythmics for AF. Choice of
antiarrhythmic agent is therefore primarily guided by safety, considering cardiac comorbidities and other
risk factors for proarrhythmic events.[1] [2]
• In patients with normal LV function, no previous myocardial infarction (MI), and no significant
structural heart disease, dofetilide, dronedarone, flecainide, or propafenone are recommended.[1]
[2] Amiodarone is an alternative option in these patients, but it is associated with a range of
adverse effects and drug interactions, so it is recommended only when other antiarrhythmics are
ineffective or contraindicated. Sotalol may also be considered in this group.[1]
• Although (like sotalol, propafenone, and flecainide) dronedarone is less effective than amiodarone
for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, it has fewer adverse effects.[152] [153] [154] [155]
 Dronedarone is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with paroxysmal or
persistent AF and associated cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age >70 years, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident, left atrial diameter ≥50 mm, or left ventricular
ejection fraction <40%), who are in sinus rhythm, or who will be cardioverted. It is contraindicated
in patients with AF who cannot, or will not, be converted into normal sinus rhythm (i.e., permanent
AF) as a safety review showed that dronedarone doubles the risk of serious cardiovascular events
including stroke, systolic and diastolic heart failure, and death in patients with permanent AF.[156]

MANAGEMENT
• In patients with significant structural heart disease, including heart failure with reduced EF (≤40%),
or with history of myocardial infarction, options are amiodarone or dofetilide.[1] [2] Dronedarone
may be considered in patients who do not have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV
heart failure or decompensation in the last 4 weeks.[154] Sotalol should not be used in patients
with HFrEF.[1] [2]
• The ESC guidelines include specific recommendations for patients with coronary artery disease
(CAD), heart failure with preserved EF (EF >40%), or significant valvular disease: these include
amiodarone and dronedarone, with sotalol as an alternative.[2] Class Ic agents (e.g., flecainide,
propafenone) have a higher mortality in patients with CAD and are contraindicated in patients with
CAD and cardiac dysfunction.[1]
• There are also certain specific adverse effects that are more associated with certain antiarrhythmic
agents. For example, with class Ic agents (i.e., propafenone or flecainide), conversion of AF to
atrial flutter can occur with a faster ventricular response. This is due to slowing of the atrial cycle
length allowing faster AV nodal conduction. Indeed, patients can present with a wide complex
tachycardia simulating ventricular tachycardia due to rate-dependent conduction slowing in the
ventricular myocardium or a bundle-branch block pattern. Therefore, patients eligible for the use
of class Ic antiarrhythmics (i.e., propafenone or flecainide) should always be taking an AV nodal
blocking drug (e.g., beta-blocker, diltiazem, or verapamil) before initiating treatment.
• Dofetilide and sotalol may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. These agents should
be initiated within the hospital cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and dosing should be
modified based on creatinine clearance.
• It is important to monitor liver enzymes when patients are treated with dronedarone and
amiodarone. For the latter, patients should also have at least 6-month assessment of thyroid
function and annual assessment of pulmonary function tests, including diffusing lung capacity for
carbon monoxide.[1]
• Overall, antiarrhythmic drugs should be used very cautiously especially in patients with abnormal
left ventricular (LV) function and heart failure, as there is evidence showing that antiarrhythmic
drugs increase adverse events. Some antiarrhythmic agents such as sotalol may increase
mortality.[157]
Catheter ablation
Catheter ablation is used to prevent AF progression and improve symptoms in selected patients with
paroxysmal or persistent AF.[1] [2] [158] It may be used as a first-line option in some patients and in other
patients is used when antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, not tolerated, or are contraindicated.[1]
[2] [158] Isolation of the pulmonary vein is generally recommended as the target of ablation, unless
another specific AF trigger is identified.[1] [2] [158] Catheter ablation using either radiofrequency or cryo
energy to create pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) results in similar outcomes.[158] [159] [160] Additional
complex atrial substrate modification ablation strategies (e.g., linear ablations to isolate the roof and
the posterior wall of the left atrium, ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms, focal source, or
rotors) may be considered, but the benefit of this versus PVI alone is not confirmed.[1] [2] [158]
Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation over drug therapy
for rhythm control in select patients. The RAAFT (Radiofrequency Ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug
for Atrial Fibrillation Treatment) II trial and the MANTRA-PAF (Medical ANtiarrhythmic Treatment or
Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation) trial have shown better outcomes for freedom
from any AF or symptomatic AF, and improvement in quality of life with ablation.[161] [162] In the EARLY-
AF (Early Aggressive Invasive Intervention for Atrial Fibrillation) trial, at 3 years of follow-up, compared
with initial use of antiarrhythmic drugs, initial treatment of paroxysmal AF with cryoballoon catheter

Established atrial fibrillation Management
ablation was associated with a lower incidence of persistent AF and recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmia.[163]
The Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial, found
that, compared with medical therapy, catheter ablation led to improvements in quality of life, but did
not significantly reduce a composite end point of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac
arrest.[164] [165] One subgroup analysis of patients with AF and heart failure symptoms at baseline found
that catheter ablation led to improvements in survival, nonrecurrence of AF, and quality of life compared
with drug therapy.[166] Another randomized trial (CASTLE-AF) showed that the primary end point,
composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned hospitalization for worsening heart failure, significantly
improved with catheter ablation. In patients with heart failure, catheter ablation for AF was associated
with a significantly lower rate of a composite end point of death from any cause or hospitalization for
worsening heart failure than was medical therapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.87; P=0.007).
These findings indicate that catheter ablation should be considered sooner in patients with AF and LV
dysfunction.[3] [167] Meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials comparing catheter ablation with
conventional treatment in patients with AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have found that
catheter ablation decreases mortality, AF recurrence, and hospitalizations, and improves LV function,
functional capacity, and quality of life, without an increase in complications.[167] [168] [169][170][171]
[172] [173] 
Patients with AF and HF are selected for catheter ablation in a shared decision-making process.[174]
[175] In patients with HF and reduced EF (EF ≤40%) factors that should be taken into account include
LV dysfunction, functional class, comorbid conditions, hemodynamic stability, ventricular scar burden,
duration of AF, and degree of adverse atrial remodeling. Patients more likely to benefit generally are
younger and have less severe disease.[174] [175]
Patients with persistent AF who are in AF at the time of ablation should have a TEE performed to screen
for thrombus. The presence of a left atrial thrombus is a contraindication to catheter ablation of AF.
Risk of thromboembolic events is increased following catheter ablation and all patients should receive
uninterrupted oral anticoagulation before, during, and after ablation.[1] [158] Following ablation therapy,
anticoagulation is continued for at least 3 months, or longer depending on underlying risk factors (such as
stroke risk). Rate-lowering medications and antiarrhythmics may also be continued, but this will depend
on various patient factors, and the decision is individualized. If symptomatic AF recurs after catheter
ablation, a repeat procedure often results in a better success rate. Surgical ablation is another option but
does not necessarily have to follow a failed percutaneous catheter ablation.
Surgical ablation
Surgical ablation (open surgery, rather than using catheter techniques) is most often reserved for those
who are having cardiac surgery for other reasons, such as bypass or valve surgery (e.g., mitral-valve
surgery). Surgical ablation may also be used in patients with left atrial thrombus, or it may be chosen
by certain patients who do not prefer the catheter approach, in which case a minimally invasive surgical
approach is often used.[158] [176] The Cox maze procedure is the conventional surgical approach.
Multiple, precisely placed incisions are made in both atria, with the aim of isolating and terminating
the abnormal electrical impulses' routes. The Cox maze IV procedure uses a modified approach.[177]
[178] Alternative methods of creating lesions in the atria by ablation rather than incision have also been
developed (e.g., radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy, and ultrasound).

MANAGEMENT
Hybrid convergent ablation, which combines minimally invasive surgical (epicardial) and catheter
(endocardial) ablation, may be considered for patients with symptomatic, persistent AF refractory to
antiarrhythmic drug therapy.[1] [2] [179] 
Considerations for management of specific comorbidities
Heart failure (HF)
• AF and HF may cause or exacerbate each other and the relationship is complex.[2] There are
specific considerations for rate control and rhythm control strategies in patients with AF and HF,
which are covered above and also summarized here. All patients with AF and HF should receive
guideline-directed HF therapy.
• Rate control:[1] [2]
• The optimal target heart rate in patients with AF and HF is unclear; stricter rate control
may be considered in patients with suspected AF-induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF
symptoms undergoing pharmacologic rate-control therapy.[1] [2]
• In patients with AF and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF; EF >40%), a beta-blocker or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker is preferred for rate control.
• Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers must not be used in patients with HF with
reduced EF (HFrEF; EF ≤40%) owing to their negative inotropic effect.
• Digoxin is an alternative option for rate control in patients with AF and either HFpEF or
HFrEF.
• Amiodarone may be considered for acute rate control in patients with decompensated HF
when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are ineffective or
contraindicated.
• Beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, and digoxin may be used where indicated in conjunction
with drugs typically used for HF, such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors.
• In patients with HF, carvedilol is effective in rate control, and in combination with digoxin may
improve LV function.[180]
• It should be remembered that a rapid rate itself could contribute to heart failure symptoms,
and continuing or increasing beta-blockers may be appropriate rather than contraindicated in
these patients as long as other medications such as diuretics are adjusted accordingly.
• AVNA and pacing may be an option in selected patients with HF where rhythm control or
pharmacologic rate control has failed.[1] [2]
• Rhythm control:
• The US guidelines recommend an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control in
patients who present with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF.[1]
• DC cardioversion is generally preferred over pharmacologic cardioversion in patients with
(and without) HF, but is not always an option.
• Antiarrhythmic drugs should be used very cautiously especially in patients with abnormal
LV function and HF, as there is evidence that antiarrhythmic drugs increase adverse events.
Some antiarrhythmic agents, such as sotalol, may increase mortality.[157]
• Ibutilide may be used for pharmacologic cardioversion in patients with HFpEF (EF >40%),
but should be avoided in patients with HFrEF (EF ≤40%). Intravenous amiodarone is an
option for both those with HFpEF and HFrEF (but time to cardioversion is longer than with
ibutilide).[1] [2] Intravenous procainamide, if available, may be considered for pharmacologic

cardioversion in those with HFpEF when other intravenous agents are contraindicated; it
should be avoided in those with HFrEF.[1]
• The "pill-in-the-pocket" approach, self-administering a single oral dose of flecainide or
propafenone, may be an option in selected outpatients who have recurrent AF and preserved
EF. It is not an option for those with HFrEF.[1] [2]
• Patients with AF and HF are selected for catheter ablation in a shared decision-making
process.[174] [175] Patients more likely to benefit from catheter ablation are generally
younger, have an earlier stage of HF, and have less severe disease.[174] [175] In patients
with HFrEF (EF ≤40%) factors that should be taken into account include LV dysfunction,
functional class, comorbid conditions, hemodynamic stability, ventricular scar burden,
duration of AF, and degree of adverse atrial remodeling.
• Catheter ablation has been shown to improve outcomes compared with pharmacologic
therapy/conventional treatment in patients with HF and AF.[166] [167] See Catheter ablation
section above for more details.
• In patients with AF and significant structural heart disease, including HFrEF, options for long-
term maintenance of sinus rhythm are amiodarone or dofetilide.[1] [2] Dronedarone may
be considered in patients who do not have New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV
HF or decompensation in the last 4 weeks.[154] Sotalol should not be used in patients with
HFrEF.[1] [2]
• The ESC guidelines recommend amiodarone and dronedarone for long-term maintenance
of sinus rhythm in patients with HFpEF, with sotalol as an alternative.[2] For patients
with HFpEF and AF, the use of flecainide or propafenone is reasonable for long-term
maintenance of sinus rhythm provided no previous MI, or known or suspected significant
structural heart disease, or ventricular scar or fibrosis is present.[1]
Obesity
• Weight loss in patients with comorbid obesity is recommended (as part of comprehensive lifestyle
and risk factor modification program) to reduce AF incidence, progression, recurrence, and
symptoms.[1] [2]
• The US guidelines recommend an ideal target weight of at least 10% weight loss in those with
AF.[1]
• When considering anticoagulation, DOACs may be used over warfarin in those with class III obesity
(BMI ≥40 kg/m²). Given concerns about drug absorption, warfarin may be preferred in those who
have undergone bariatric surgery.[1]
• See Obesity in adults .
Diabetes
• Control of comorbid diabetes is important for risk factor modification at all stages of AF.[1] [2]
 Additionally, optimal glycemic control before AF catheter ablation has been associated with
reduced risk of AF recurrence after ablation.[1] [2]
• When considering anticoagulation, DOACs have been associated with reduced vascular mortality
compared with warfarin in those with AF and diabetes.[1] [2]
• See Overview of diabetes .
Hypertension
• Control of comorbid hypertension is important for risk factor modification at all stages of
AF. Optimal BP control is recommended to reduce recurrence of AF and risk of AF-related
cardiovascular events, such as stroke and bleeding.[1] [2]

MANAGEMENT
• See Essential hypertension .
Valvular heart disease (VHD)
• The risk of stroke and thromboembolism is increased in patients with AF and VHD. The US
guidelines recommend that patients with AF and significant (moderate or greater) mitral stenosis or
a mechanical heart valve should receive long-term anticoagulation regardless of CHA₂DS₂-VASc
score.[1] Warfarin is recommended over DOACs in these patients.[1] [2]
• In patients with AF and other comorbid VHD (i.e., not moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis or a
mechanical heart valve), DOACs may be used over warfarin in those who are candidates for
anticoagulation.[1] [2]
• The ESC guidelines recommend amiodarone and dronedarone for long-term maintenance of sinus
rhythm in patients with AF and significant valvular disease, with sotalol as an alternative.[2]
• Concomitant surgical ablation carried out during mitral-valve surgery has been shown to reduce the
risk of recurrent AF.[1] [2] [181] [182]
Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
• AF and CKD are common comorbidities; however, there are limited data on management of AF in
patients with CKD. The US guidelines note that doses of antiarrhythmic drugs are adjusted based
on pharmacokinetic data and clinical experience, and that amiodarone is the only antiarrhythmic
drug that does not require dose adjustment in patients with CKD or those receiving dialysis.[1] The
guidelines also note that if performing catheter ablation in patients with CKD, particular attention
must be paid to fluid balance when using irrigated radiofrequency catheters.[1]
• Renal function must be considered when selecting an anticoagulant regimen:
• Some DOACs may require a dose adjustment and others are not recommended, depending
on the degree of renal impairment and the indication for use. Consult a drug information
source for specific guidance on use in patients with renal impairment.
• In patients with AF and mild or moderate renal impairment who do not have valve disease,
the use of DOACs has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of stroke or systemic
embolism and a reduced risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, which suggests a
favorable risk profile of these agents in patients with mild to moderate renal disease.[183]
• The US guidelines specifically advise that patients with stage 3 CKD may receive either
a DOAC (preferred) or warfarin; patients with stage 4 CKD may reasonably receive either
warfarin or a DOAC; and patients with end-stage CKD (CrCl <15 mL/min) or who are on
dialysis may reasonably receive warfarin or apixaban.[1] In Europe, DOACs are not approved
for patients with CrCl ≤15 mL/min or on dialysis.[2]
• See Chronic kidney disease .
Liver dysfunction
• In patients with AF and liver disease, choice of anticoagulation may be guided by liver function.
• In those with mild or moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh score A or B), DOACs may be used
over warfarin; however, rivaroxaban should not be used in moderate liver disease (Child-
Pugh B).[1] [2]
• There are no data on use of DOACs in patients with severe liver disease (Child-Pugh
class C). In Europe, DOACs are contraindicated in these patients.[1] [2] Warfarin may be
used in patients with Child-Pugh class C liver disease; in high-risk patients (recent major
bleeding, active coagulopathy, severe thrombocytopenia, or high-risk varices not amenable
to intervention) decision to use is individualized.[184]

Established atrial fibrillation Management
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome
• In patients with AF and WPW syndrome, rapid conduction of atrial electrical activity to the ventricles
via an accessory pathway (preexcitation) may cause fast ventricular rates, with an increased risk of
ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.[1] [2]
• Hemodynamically stable patients with preexcited AF may be treated with pharmacologic
cardioversion with ibutilide or procainamide (if available). AV nodal blocking agents (e.g.,
verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, beta-blockers) are contraindicated in
preexcited AF.
• Hemodynamically unstable patients with preexcited AF should be treated with DC
cardioversion.
• See Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome .
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
• Patients with HCM and AF have an increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism and should
receive long-term anticoagulation regardless of CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.[1] The US guidelines on
HCM recommend DOACs as the preferred option in patients with HCM and AF, and warfarin as the
second-line alternative.[185]
• A rhythm control strategy may be preferred in patients with HCM; choice of rhythm control is
individualized and cardioversion or antiarrhythmic drugs may be used. Catheter ablation may
also be considered, but is less effective in those with HCM compared with those without. Surgical
ablation may also be considered as a potential rhythm management option in patients undergoing
surgical myectomy.[185]
Pulmonary disease
• In patients with AF and COPD, cardioselective beta-blockers may be used for rate control (other
rate control agents may also be used, but beta-blockers do not need to be avoided). In patients with
reactive airway disease, such as asthma, beta-blockers should be avoided.[1]
• The US guidelines advise that in those with AF and pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary
vascular disease, a rhythm-control strategy may improve functional status and potentially prolong
survival.[1]
Chronic coronary disease (CCD)
• For maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and CAD, the ESC guidelines recommend
amiodarone and dronedarone, with sotalol as an alternative.[2] Class Ic agents (e.g., flecainide,
propafenone) have a higher mortality in patients with CAD and are contraindicated in patients with
CAD and cardiac dysfunction.[1]
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)
• Patients with AF should have their risk factors for SDB considered, and screening, diagnosis, and
management of SDB provided where indicated.[43] Although polysomnography is the gold standard
for diagnosing SDB, home sleep apnea testing shows promise in diagnosing OSA in most patients
with AF.[43]
• Treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure may reduce AF
burden and risk of recurrence; however, more evidence is needed to confirm this.[1] [2]

Established atrial fibrillation Management
MANAGEMENT
• Patients with AF and cancer should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Treatments for AF
may be less effective if it is caused directly by the cancer therapy.[59]
• Drug-drug interactions can occur between cancer therapies and AF therapies (antiarrhythmics, rate
control agents, and anticoagulants).
• When using antiarrhythmic agents, risk of QT interval prolongation should be considered as
patients with cancer are already at an increased risk.[1]
• Beta-blockers are preferred for rate control in patients with cancer and AF, particularly if
the cancer therapies have potential cardiovascular risk; diltiazem and verapamil should be
avoided due to associations with negative inotropic effects and drug-drug interactions.[59]
• When choosing an anticoagulant in patients with cancer and AF, the cancer type, status, and
prognosis, as well as the patient’s bleeding/thromboembolic risk should all be considered. DOACs
are recommended as first-line in patients without a high bleeding risk, severe renal dysfunction, or
significant drug-drug interactions. LMWH can be considered in patients who have active cancer and
AF if DOACs are not suitable.[59]
Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)
• The US guidelines advise that adults with moderate or complex CHD may tolerate AF poorly
and rhythm control is generally preferred over rate control. Choice of antiarrhythmic must be
individualized.[1] Ablation may be an option in patients with AF and simple CHD.
• Electrophysiologic procedures should be performed by those with expertize in ACHD and in
collaboration with an ACHD cardiologist.[1]
• Some patients with moderate or complex CHD (e.g., Fontan circulation, cyanosis) are at higher
risk for thromboembolic events and anticoagulation may be indicated regardless of usual AF risk
score.[1] [2]

Acute
paroxysmal or persistent AF:
hemodynamically unstable
1st direct current (DC) cardioversion
» Patients with established atrial fibrillation
(AF) may present acutely with hemodynamic
instability. AF with a rapid ventricular rate
causing ongoing chest pain, hypotension,
shortness of breath, dizziness, or syncope
requires immediate direct current (DC)
cardioversion.[3]
» DC cardioversion is performed under adequate
short-acting general anesthesia and involves
delivery of an electrical shock synchronized
with the intrinsic activity of the heart by sensing
the R wave of the ECG (i.e., synchronized).
Most currently used external defibrillators utilize
biphasic energy, 100-360 J, depending on
body size and the presence of other comorbid
conditions.
» Imaging to rule out the presence of a clot
should be considered whenever possible before
cardioversion, in those at higher thromboembolic
risk, or unknown anticoagulation profile.[1] AF
that is asymptomatic before the immediate
event is common, making a determination of the
duration uncertain..

» A rate-control strategy may be preferred over
rhythm control in older patients who have a
longer history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and fewer
symptoms, and in whom likelihood of successful
restoration of sinus rhythm would be deemed
low, such as in patients with very large left
atrium.[1] [2]
» Aggressive rate control with pharmacologic
agents may result in significant depression of the
left ventricular (LV) systolic function. A lenient
rate-control strategy (resting heart rate <110
bpm) may be reasonable as long as patients
remain asymptomatic and left ventricular systolic
function is preserved.[1] [2]
» Patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF with
rapid ventricular response requiring acute rate
control are treated with either a beta-blocker,
a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker
(diltiazem or verapamil, if ejection fraction [EF]
>40%), digoxin, or amiodarone.[1] [2]
» Choice of therapy is determined by presence
of comorbidities, presence or absence of
heart failure, and left ventricular EF. When left
ventricular function is preserved, a beta-blocker
or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker
is preferred. Digoxin is not considered a first-
line agent for the purpose of rate control, but it
can be useful (either alone or in combination)
when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers are ineffective or
contraindicated. Amiodarone may be considered
for acute rate control in patients who are critically
ill when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers are ineffective or
contraindicated.[1] [2]
» Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers (if EF >40%) may also be
used for long-term rate control, with digoxin
considered either alone or in combination if other
options are not tolerated or contraindicated.[1]

» Risk of stroke and thromboembolic events
should be assessed in all patients using
a validated clinical risk score, such as the
CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool.[1] [2] [78] Guidelines from
the American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association/American Association of
Colleges of Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society
(ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS) recommend that the risk
is evaluated annually.[1]
» The CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool is the most validated
risk score and is most widely used.[1] [2] [78]
 CHA₂DS₂-VASc allocates 1 point each for
chronic heart failure, hypertension, age 65-74
years, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease, and
female sex, and 2 points each for a history of
stroke or transient ischemic attack, or age 75
years and older.[99]  The ACC/AHA/ACCP/
HRS and ESC guidelines recommend the use
of oral anticoagulants for patients with AF and
a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥2 in men or ≥3
in women (1 for gender, and 2 for additional
risk factors), which corresponds to annual
thromboembolic risk of ≥2%.[1] [2] With a score
of ≥1 in men or ≥2 in women (1 for gender
and 1 for additional risk factors; corresponds
to annual risk of ≥1% to <2%), the use of oral
anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic
stroke can be considered; additional factors that
may modify stroke risk, such as hypertension
control, can be taken into account.[1] [2] Use of
oral anticoagulants in patients with a nonsex-
related CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 is particularly
important to consider in patients over the age of
65 years.[3]
» Use of any anticoagulation strategy needs to
be balanced with the risk of bleeding, particularly
intracranial bleeding.[100] Scoring systems
such as ORBIT, HAS-BLED, HEMORR₂HAGES,
and the newer direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)
score can help to quantify this risk and assess
how the bleeding risk can be minimized.[101]

Bleeding Risk] (https://www.mdcalc.com/
calc/1785/hemorr2hages-score-major-bleeding-
risk)   When used in combination with a stroke
risk score such as CHA₂DS₂-VASc, bleeding risk
tools provide a means to balance the benefits
and risks of anticoagulation with patients.
Bleeding risk scores should not be used to
exclude people from receiving anticoagulant
treatment.[1] [2] [102]
» In patients with cardiac implantable electronic
devices, AF may be detected as atrial high
rate episodes (AHRE), which can be silent/
asymptomatic. Anticoagulation therapy for
prevention of thromboembolism and stroke
based on subclinical AF has not shown to
be convincingly useful; use of DOACs in the
ARTESIA and NOAH-AF trials was associated
with increased risk of major bleeding.[103] [104]
 In patients who have longer duration AHREs,
are at higher risk of stroke (e.g., measured by
CHA₂DS₂-VASc), and have symptomatic AF,
anticoagulation may be of benefit.[1] [2] [105]
» Oral anticoagulation drugs for stroke
prevention are warfarin or a DOAC such as
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.
All patients should preferably be started on
a DOAC, unless they are not eligible (e.g.,
presence of moderate to severe mitral valve
stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or
DOACs are not available.[1] [2] [78] DOACs
are generally safe in older patients; however,
dabigatran may be associated with an increased
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with
warfarin.[117]
» If DOACs are used in patients with renal
impairment, they should be used with caution.
Some DOACs may require dose adjustment
and some contraindicated. Consult a drug
information source for specific guidance on
use in patients with renal impairment. DOACs
should not be used in combination with heparin
(including low molecular weight heparin
[LMWH]), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.
» The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation
with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality
of anticoagulation control as reflected by the
average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of
INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT₂R₂ scoring system
(based on sex, age, medical history, treatment
interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool that
may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients
who are less likely to maintain TTR >70% and
who should, therefore, be managed with DOACs
instead of warfarin.[118] [119]  [SAMe-TT₂R₂

» Risk of stroke and thromboembolic events
should be assessed in all patients using
a validated clinical risk score, such as the
CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool.[1] [2] [78] Guidelines from
the American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association/American Association of
Colleges of Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society
(ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS) recommend that the risk
is evaluated annually.[1]
» The CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool is the most validated
risk score and is most widely used.[1] [2] [78]
 CHA₂DS₂-VASc allocates 1 point each for
chronic heart failure, hypertension, age 65 to
74 years, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease,
and female sex, and 2 points each for a history
of stroke or transient ischemic attack, or age
75 years and older.[99]  The ACC/AHA/ACCP/
HRS and ESC guidelines recommend the use
of oral anticoagulants for patients with AF and
a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥2 in men or ≥3
in women (1 for gender, and 2 for additional
risk factors), which corresponds to annual
thromboembolic risk of ≥2%.[1] [2] With a score
of ≥1 in men or ≥2 in women (1 for gender
and 1 for additional risk factors; corresponds
to annual risk of ≥1% to <2%), the use of oral
anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic
stroke can be considered; additional factors that
may modify stroke risk, such as hypertension
control, can be taken into account.[1] [2] Use of
oral anticoagulants in patients with a nonsex-
related CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 is particularly
important to consider in patients over the age of
65 years.[3]
» Use of any anticoagulation strategy needs to
be balanced with the risk of bleeding, particularly
intracranial bleeding.[100] Scoring systems such
as ORBIT, HAS-BLED, HEMORR₂HAGES, and
the newer DOAC score can help to quantify this
risk and assess how the bleeding risk can be
minimized.[101]  [MdCalc: HEMORR₂HAGES
Score for Major Bleeding Risk] (https://
www.mdcalc.com/calc/1785/hemorr2hages-
score-major-bleeding-risk)   When used in
combination with a stroke risk score such as
CHA₂DS₂-VASc, bleeding risk tools provide
a means to balance the benefits and risks of
anticoagulation with patients. Bleeding risk
scores should not be used to exclude people
from receiving anticoagulant treatment.[1] [2]

therapy for prevention of thromboembolism and
stroke based on subclinical AF has not shown
to be convincingly useful; use of DOACs in the
ARTESIA and NOAH-AF trials was associated
with increased risk of major bleeding.[103] [104]
 In patients who have longer duration AHREs,
are at higher risk of stroke (e.g., measured by
CHA₂DS₂-VASc), and have symptomatic AF,
anticoagulation may be of benefit.[1] [2] [105]
» Oral anticoagulation drugs for stroke
prevention are warfarin or a DOAC such as
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.
All patients should preferably be started on
a DOAC, unless they are not eligible (e.g.,
presence of moderate to severe mitral valve
stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or
DOACs are not available.[1] [2] [78] DOACs
are generally safe in older patients; however,
dabigatran may be associated with an increased
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with
warfarin.[117]
» If DOACs are used in patients with renal
impairment, they should be used with caution.
Some DOACs may require dose adjustment
and some may be contraindicated. Consult a
drug information source for specific guidance on
use in patients with renal impairment. DOACs
should not be used in combination with heparin
(including LMWH), heparin derivatives, or
warfarin.
» The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation
with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality
of anticoagulation control as reflected by the
average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of
INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT₂R₂ scoring system
(based on sex, age, medical history, treatment
interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool that
may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients
who are less likely to maintain TTR >70% and
who should, therefore, be managed with DOACs
instead of warfarin.[118] [119]  [SAMe-TT₂R₂
score] (http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/resources/tools/
same-tt2r2.html) 
» Recommendations for anticoagulation in
patients with concomitant condition are available
and should be consulted.[1] [2]
» Concomitant surgical LAA exclusion may
be considered (in addition to continued
anticoagulation) in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-
VASc score ≥2 or equivalent stroke risk who
are undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary
artery bypass graft or valve surgery).[1]

generally preferred in patients who have a larger
left atrium, less left ventricular dysfunction,
less atrioventricular regurgitation, and an easily
controlled heart rate.
» Aggressive rate control with pharmacologic
agents may result in significant depression of
the left ventricular systolic function. In some
patients who have slow resting heart rates,
drug therapy could be hazardous. A lenient
rate-control strategy (resting heart rate <110
bpm) may be reasonable as long as patients
remain asymptomatic and left ventricular systolic
function is preserved.
» Patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF with
rapid ventricular response requiring acute rate
control are treated with either a beta-blocker,
a nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker
(diltiazem or verapamil, if ejection fraction [EF]
>40%), digoxin, or amiodarone.[1] [2]
» Choice of therapy is determined by presence
of comorbidities, presence or absence of
heart failure, and left ventricular EF. When left
ventricular function is preserved, a beta-blocker
or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker
is preferred. Digoxin is not considered a first-
line agent for the purpose of rate control, but it
can be useful (either alone or in combination)
when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers are ineffective or
contraindicated. Amiodarone may be considered
for acute rate control in patients who are critically
ill when beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers are ineffective or
contraindicated.[1] [2]
» Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers (if EF >40%) may also be
used for long-term rate control, with digoxin
considered either alone or in combination if other
options are not tolerated or contraindicated.[1]
[2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
HF: in patients with AF and HF with preserved
EF (HFpEF; EF >40%), a beta-blocker or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker is
preferred for rate control. Nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers must not be used in
patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; EF
≤40%) owing to their negative inotropic effect.
Digoxin is an alternative option for rate control
in patients with AF and either HFpEF or HFrEF.
Amiodarone may be considered for acute rate

» Considerations for patients with comorbid
pulmonary disease: cardioselective beta-
blockers (e.g., atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol)
may be used for rate control in patients with AF
and COPD (other rate control agents may also
be used, but beta-blockers do not need to be
avoided). Beta-blockers should be avoided in
patients with reactive airway disease, such as
asthma.[1]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
cancer: patients with AF and cancer should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team. Treatments
for AF may be less effective if it is caused
directly by the cancer therapy.[59] Drug-drug
interactions can occur between cancer therapies
and AF therapies. Beta-blockers are preferred
for rate control in patients with cancer and
AF, particularly if the cancer therapies have
potential cardiovascular risk; diltiazem and
verapamil should be avoided due to associations
with negative inotropic effects and drug-drug
interactions.[59]

hemodynamically stable patients.[1] DC
cardioversion is quicker and more effective than
pharmacologic cardioversion and is generally
preferred, but it requires sedation.
» Both DC and pharmacologic cardioversion
are associated with increased risk of
thromboembolic events and risk must be
minimized before going ahead.[147] [148] If
cardioversion is indicated for an episode of AF
≥48 hours or of unknown duration, it must be
performed only after a minimum of 3 weeks on
oral anticoagulation (DOAC or warfarin), or after
imaging to rule out presence of an intracardiac
thrombus (e.g., if patient has had previous
LAAO and is not receiving anticoagulation).[1]
If the duration of AF is <48 hours, cardioversion
is generally thought to have a low risk of
thromboembolic events with anticoagulation
afterward; however, imaging to rule out the
presence of an intracardiac thrombus may be
considered before cardioversion, particularly
in those who have not received a minimum of
3 weeks on oral anticoagulation and those at
higher thromboembolic risk.[1] The benefit of
pericardioversion anticoagulation or imaging
in patients with a low risk of thromboembolism
and AF duration <12 hours is uncertain.[1] AF
that is asymptomatic before the immediate
event is common, making a determination of
the duration uncertain. Guidelines recommend
that therapeutic anticoagulation is started
before cardioversion and continued for at least
4 weeks afterwards.[1] If intracardiac thrombus
is identified on imaging and cardioversion is
delayed, anticoagulation is given for a minimum
of 3 to 6 weeks and imaging repeated before
cardioversion is considered again.[1]
» In patients with hemodynamically stable
persistent AF with preserved left ventricular
function and no evidence of metabolic and
electrolyte disturbances, pharmacologic
cardioversion may be attempted with
administration of intravenous ibutilide under
close telemetry monitoring.[1] Because the
half-life of ibutilide is 3 to 6 hours, prolonged
observation period is recommended in
patients who have received ibutilide.[150] [151]
 Intravenous amiodarone is also an option for
pharmacologic cardioversion (including patients
with HF), but time to cardioversion is longer than
with ibutilide.[1] [2]

success of DC cardioversion and reduce risk of
AF recurrence.[150] [151]
» If pharmacologic conversion is attempted
and is unsuccessful, DC conversion should
be considered rather than switching to an
alternative antiarrhythmic agent.[1]
» Selected outpatients who have recurrent
AF may self-administer a single oral dose
of flecainide or propafenone (known as
the "pill-in-the-pocket" approach).[1] [2] An
atrioventricular node-blocking agent (beta-
blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel
blocker) should be administered concomitantly,
to prevent atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction.
Safety and efficacy of this approach in selected
patients should be established first in a
monitored hospital setting.[1] [2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
HF: antiarrhythmic drugs should be used very
cautiously especially in patients with abnormal
LV function and HF. Some antiarrhythmic agents,
such as sotalol, may increase mortality.[157]
 Ibutilide may be used for pharmacologic
cardioversion in patients with HFpEF (EF >40%),
but should be avoided in patients with HFrEF
(EF ≤40%). Intravenous amiodarone is an option
for both those with HFpEF and HFrEF (but time
to cardioversion is longer than with ibutilide).[1]
[2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
CKD: there are limited data on management of
AF in patients with CKD. Doses of antiarrhythmic
drugs are adjusted based on pharmacokinetic
data and clinical experience.[1] Some drugs
should be used with caution in patients with
renal impairment and a dose adjustment
may be required. Some drugs may also be
contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.
Check your local drug information source for
more information.
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome:
in patients with AF and WPW syndrome,
rapid conduction of atrial electrical activity
to the ventricles via an accessory pathway
(preexcitation) may cause fast ventricular rates,
with an increased risk of ventricular fibrillation
and sudden death.[1] [2] Hemodynamically
stable patients with preexcited AF may be
treated with pharmacologic cardioversion.
AV nodal blocking agents (e.g., verapamil,
diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine,
beta-blockers) are contraindicated in preexcited

» Considerations for patients with comorbid
cancer: patients with AF and cancer should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team. Treatments
for AF may be less effective if it is caused
directly by the cancer therapy.[59] Drug-drug
interactions can occur between cancer therapies
and AF therapies. When using antiarrhythmic

» Risk of stroke and thromboembolic events
should be assessed in all patients using
a validated clinical risk score, such as the
CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool.[1] [2] [78] Guidelines from
the American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association/American Association of
Colleges of Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society
(ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS) recommend that the risk
is evaluated annually.[1]
» The CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool is the most validated
risk score and is most widely used.[1] [2] [78]
 CHA₂DS₂-VASc allocates 1 point each for
chronic heart failure, hypertension, age 65 to
74 years, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease,
and female sex, and 2 points each for a history
of stroke or transient ischemic attack, or age
75 years and older.[99]  The ACC/AHA/ACCP/
HRS and ESC guidelines recommend the use
of oral anticoagulants for patients with AF and
a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥2 in men or ≥3
in women (1 for gender, and 2 for additional
risk factors), which corresponds to annual
thromboembolic risk of ≥2%.[1] [2] With a score
of ≥1 in men or ≥2 in women (1 for gender
and 1 for additional risk factors; corresponds
to annual risk of ≥1% to <2%), the use of oral
anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic
stroke can be considered; additional factors that
may modify stroke risk, such as hypertension
control, can be taken into account.[1] [2] Use of
oral anticoagulants in patients with a nonsex-
related CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 is particularly
important to consider in patients over the age of
65 years.[3]
» Use of any anticoagulation strategy needs to
be balanced with the risk of bleeding, particularly
intracranial bleeding.[100] Scoring systems such
as ORBIT, HAS-BLED, HEMORR₂HAGES, and
the newer DOAC score can help to quantify this
risk and assess how the bleeding risk can be
minimized.[101]  [MdCalc. HEMORR₂HAGES

CHA₂DS₂-VASc, bleeding risk tools provide
a means to balance the benefits and risks of
anticoagulation with patients. Bleeding risk
scores should not be used to exclude people
from receiving anticoagulant treatment.[1] [2]
[102]
» In patients with cardiac implantable electronic
devices, AF may be detected as AHRE, which
can be silent/asymptomatic. Anticoagulation
therapy for prevention of thromboembolism and
stroke based on subclinical AF has not shown
to be convincingly useful; use of DOACs in the
ARTESIA and NOAH-AF trials was associated
with increased risk of major bleeding.[103] [104]
 In patients who have longer duration AHREs,
are at higher risk of stroke (e.g., measured by
CHA₂DS₂-VASc), and have symptomatic AF,
anticoagulation may be of benefit.[1] [2] [105]
» Oral anticoagulation drugs for stroke
prevention are warfarin or a DOAC such as
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.
All patients should preferably be started on
a DOAC, unless they are not eligible (e.g.,
presence of moderate to severe mitral valve
stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or
DOACs are not available.[1] [2][78] DOACs
are generally safe in older patients; however,
dabigatran may be associated with an increased
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with
warfarin.[117]
» If DOACs are used in patients with renal
impairment they should be used with caution.
Some DOACs may require dose adjustment
and some may be contraindicated. Consult a
drug information source for specific guidance on
use in patients with renal impairment. DOACs
should not be used in combination with heparin
(including LMWH), heparin derivatives, or
warfarin.
» The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation
with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality
of anticoagulation control as reflected by the
average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of
INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT₂R₂ scoring system
(based on sex, age, medical history, treatment
interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool that
may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients
who are less likely to maintain TTR >70% and
who should, therefore, be managed with DOACs
instead of warfarin.[118] [119]  [SAMe-TT₂R₂

patients with concomitant conditions are
available and should be consulted.[1] [2]
» Concomitant surgical LAA exclusion may
be considered (in addition to continued
anticoagulation) in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-
VASc score ≥2 or equivalent stroke risk who
are undergoing cardiac surgery (e.g., coronary
artery bypass graft or valve surgery).[1]
» The ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS, ESC, and NICE
(UK) guidelines do not recommend aspirin
as an alternative to anticoagulation for stroke
prevention in patients with AF.[1] [2] [78]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
obesity: DOACs may be used over warfarin in
those with class III obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m²).
Warfarin may be preferred in those who have
undergone bariatric surgery.[1]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
diabetes: DOACs are associated with reduced
vascular mortality compared with warfarin in
those with AF and diabetes.[1] [2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
VHD: the US guidelines recommend that
patients with AF and significant (moderate or
greater) mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart
valve should receive long-term anticoagulation
regardless of CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.[1]
 Warfarin is recommended over DOACs in these
patients.[1] [2] In patients with AF and other
comorbid VHD (i.e., not moderate-to-severe
mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve),
DOACs may be used over warfarin.[1] [2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
CKD: renal function must be considered when
selecting an anticoagulant regimen. Some
drugs should be used with caution in patients
with renal impairment and a dose adjustment
may be required. Some drugs may also be
contraindicated in patients with renal impairment.
Check your local drug information source for
more information. The US guidelines advise that
patients with stage 3 CKD may receive either a
DOAC (preferred) or warfarin; patients with stage
4 CKD may reasonably receive either warfarin
or a DOAC; and patients with end-stage CKD
(CrCl <15 mL/min) or who are on dialysis may
reasonably receive warfarin or apixaban.[1] In
Europe, DOACs are not approved for patients
with CrCl ≤15 mL/min or on dialysis.[2]

disease: in those with mild or moderate liver
disease (Child-Pugh score A or B), DOACs may

should not be used in moderate liver disease
(Child-Pugh B).[1] [2] There are no data on use
of DOACs in patients with severe liver disease

contraindicated in these patients.[1] [2] Warfarin
may be used in patients with Child-Pugh class
C liver disease; in high-risk patients (recent
major bleeding, active coagulopathy, severe
thrombocytopenia, or high-risk varices not
amenable to intervention) decision to use is
individualized.[184]

HCM: patients with HCM and AF should
receive long-term anticoagulation regardless
of CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.[1] The US guidelines
recommend DOACs as the preferred option in
patients with HCM and AF, and warfarin as the
second-line alternative.[185]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
cancer: patients with AF and cancer should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team. When
choosing an anticoagulant in patients with
cancer and AF, the cancer type, status, and
prognosis, as well as the patient’s bleeding/
thromboembolic risk should all be considered.
DOACs are recommended as first-line in patients

risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing
(SDB) considered, and screening, diagnosis,
and management of SDB provided where
indicated.[43]
adjunct catheter or surgical ablation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Catheter ablation may be used as a first-
line option in some patients and in other
patients is used when antiarrhythmic drugs
have been ineffective, not tolerated, or are
contraindicated.[1] [2] [158]
» Isolation of the pulmonary vein is generally
recommended as the target of ablation, unless
another specific AF trigger is identified.[1]
[2] [158] Catheter ablation using either
radiofrequency or cryo energy to create
pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) results in similar
outcomes.[158][159] [160] Additional complex
atrial substrate modification ablation strategies
(e.g., linear ablations to isolate the roof and
the posterior wall of the left atrium, ablation
of complex fractionated atrial electrograms,
focal source, or rotors) may be considered,
but the benefit of this versus PVI alone is not
confirmed.[1] [2] [158]
» Randomized controlled trials have
demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation
over drug therapy for rhythm control in select
patients.[161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] 
» Patients with persistent AF who are in AF
at the time of ablation should have a TEE
performed to screen for thrombus. Risk of
thromboembolic events is increased following
catheter ablation and all patients should receive
uninterrupted oral anticoagulation before, during,
and after ablation.[1] [158] Following ablation
therapy, anticoagulation is continued for at least
3 months, or longer depending on underlying
risk factors (such as stroke risk). Rate-lowering
medications and antiarrhythmics may also be
continued, but this will depend on various patient
factors, and the decision is individualized. If
symptomatic AF recurs after catheter ablation,
a repeat procedure often results in a better
success rate.

reserved for those who are having cardiac
surgery for other reasons, such as bypass or
valve surgery (e.g., mitral-valve surgery). It may
also be used in patients with left atrial thrombus,
or it may be chosen by certain patients who do
not prefer the catheter approach, in which case
a minimally invasive surgical approach is often
used.[158][176] The Cox maze procedure is
the conventional surgical approach. Multiple,
precisely placed incisions are made in both
atria, with the aim of isolating and terminating
the abnormal electrical impulses' routes.
The Cox maze IV procedure uses a modified
approach.[177] [178] Alternative methods of
creating lesions in the atria by ablation rather
than incision have also been developed (e.g.,
radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy, and
ultrasound). Hybrid convergent ablation, which
combines minimally invasive surgical (epicardial)
and catheter (endocardial) ablation, may be
considered for patients with symptomatic,
persistent AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drug
therapy.[1] [2] [179]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
HF: patients with AF and HF more likely to
benefit from catheter ablation are generally
younger, have an earlier stage of HF, and have
less severe disease.[174] [175] In patients with
HFrEF(EF ≤40%) factors that should be taken
into account include LV dysfunction, functional
class, comorbid conditions, hemodynamic
stability, ventricular scar burden, duration of
AF, and degree of adverse atrial remodeling.
Catheter ablation has been shown to improve
outcomes compared with pharmacologic
therapy/conventional treatment in patients with
HF and AF.[166] [167]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
CKD: when performing catheter ablation in
patients with CKD, particular attention must
be paid to fluid balance when using irrigated
radiofrequency catheters.[1]

HCM: a rhythm control strategy may be
preferred in patients with HCM; choice of rhythm
control is individualized. Catheter ablation
may be considered, but is less effective in
those with HCM compared with those without.

» Long-term use of antiarrhythmic drugs is
considered for maintenance of sinus rhythm
after cardioversion in patients in whom catheter
ablation is not suitable or not preferred.
Pharmacologic maintenance of sinus rhythm can
also be considered while awaiting ablation.
» Adverse effects associated with use of
antiarrhythmics include bradycardia or worsening
of underlying sinus node dysfunction, or AV
block. There is a risk of other arrhythmias
developing with the use of these antiarrhythmics
for AF. Choice of antiarrhythmic agent is
therefore primarily guided by safety, considering
cardiac comorbidities and other risk factors for
proarrhythmic events.[1] [2]
» In patients with normal LV function, no
previous myocardial infarction (MI), and no
significant structural heart disease, dofetilide,
dronedarone, flecainide, or propafenone
are recommended.[1] [2] Amiodarone is an
alternative option in these patients, but it is
associated with a range of adverse effects and
drug interactions, so is recommended only
when other antiarrhythmics are ineffective or
contraindicated. Sotalol may also be considered
in this group.[1]
» Although (like sotalol, propafenone, and
flecainide) dronedarone is less effective than
amiodarone for the maintenance of sinus rhythm,
it has fewer adverse effects.[152] [153] [154]
[155] Dronedarone is indicated to reduce the
risk of hospitalization in patients with paroxysmal
or persistent AF and associated cardiovascular
risk factors (i.e., age >70 years, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident,
left atrial diameter ≥50 mm, or left ventricular
ejection fraction <40%), who are in sinus rhythm,
or who will be cardioverted.
» Specific adverse effects are more associated
with certain antiarrhythmic agents. For example,
with class Ic agents (i.e., propafenone or
flecainide), conversion of AF to atrial flutter can
occur with a faster ventricular response. This is
due to slowing of the atrial cycle length allowing
faster AV nodal conduction. Indeed, patients
can present with a wide complex tachycardia
simulating ventricular tachycardia due to rate-
dependent conduction slowing in the ventricular
myocardium or a bundle-branch block pattern.
Therefore, patients eligible for the use of class Ic
antiarrhythmics (i.e., propafenone or flecainide)
should always be taking an AV nodal blocking
drug (e.g., beta-blocker, nondihydropyridine

» Dofetilide and sotalol may cause QT
prolongation and torsades de pointes. These
agents should be initiated within the hospital
cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and
dosing should be modified based on creatinine
clearance.
» It is important to monitor liver enzymes when
patients are treated with dronedarone and
amiodarone. For the latter, patients should also
have at least 6-monthly assessment of thyroid
function and annual assessment of pulmonary
function tests, including diffusing lung capacity
for carbon monoxide.[1]
» Overall, antiarrhythmic drugs should be used
very cautiously, especially in patients with
abnormal left ventricular (LV) function and heart
failure, as they may increase adverse events.
Some antiarrhythmic agents such as sotalol may
increase mortality.[157]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid HF:
in patients with AF and significant structural
heart disease, including HFrEF, options for
long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm are
amiodarone or dofetilide.[1] [2] Dronedarone
may be considered in patients who do not have
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV
HF or decompensation in the last 4 weeks.[154]
 Sotalol should not be used in patients with
HFrEF.[1] [2] The ESC guidelines recommend
amiodarone and dronedarone for long-term
maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients
with HFpEF, with sotalol as an alternative.[2]
 For patients with HFpEF and AF, the use of
flecainide or propafenone is reasonable for long-
term maintenance of sinus rhythm provided no
previous MI, or known or suspected significant
structural heart disease, or ventricular scar or
fibrosis is present.[1]

managed by a multidisciplinary team. Treatments
for AF may be less effective if it is caused
directly by the cancer therapy.[59] Drug-drug

» Either DC cardioversion or pharmacologic
cardioversion can be considered in
hemodynamically stable patients.[1] DC
cardioversion is quicker and more effective than
pharmacologic cardioversion and is generally
preferred, but it requires sedation.
» Both DC and pharmacologic cardioversion
are associated with increased risk of
thromboembolic events and risk must be
minimized before going ahead.[147] [148] If
cardioversion is indicated for an episode of AF
≥48 hours or of unknown duration, it must be
performed only after a minimum of 3 weeks on
oral anticoagulation (DOAC or warfarin), or after
imaging to rule out presence of an intracardiac
thrombus (e.g., if patient has had previous
LAAO and is not receiving anticoagulation).[1]
If the duration of AF is <48 hours, cardioversion
is generally thought to have a low risk of
thromboembolic events with anticoagulation
afterward; however, imaging to rule out the
presence of an intracardiac thrombus may be
considered before cardioversion, particularly
in those who have not received a minimum of
3 weeks on oral anticoagulation and those at
higher thromboembolic risk.[1] The benefit of
pericardioversion anticoagulation or imaging
in patients with a low risk of thromboembolism
and AF duration <12 hours is uncertain.[1] AF
that is asymptomatic before the immediate
event is common, making a determination of
the duration uncertain. Guidelines recommend
that therapeutic anticoagulation is started
before cardioversion and continued for at least
4 weeks afterwards.[1] If intracardiac thrombus

is delayed, anticoagulation is given for a
minimum of 3 to 6 weeks and imaging repeated
before cardioversion is considered again.[1] In
those who have contraindication to long-term
anticoagulants, either percutaneous or surgical
left atrial occlusion/clipping/removal should be
considered and recommended as the left atrial
appendage is a major source for AF-related
thrombus formation.
» In patients with hemodynamically stable
persistent AF with preserved left ventricular
function and no evidence of metabolic and
electrolyte disturbances, pharmacologic
cardioversion may be attempted with
administration of intravenous ibutilide under
close telemetry monitoring.[1] Because the
half-life of ibutilide is 3 to 6 hours, prolonged
observation period is recommended in
patients who have received ibutilide.[150] [151]
 Intravenous amiodarone is also an option for
pharmacologic cardioversion (including patients
with HF), but time to cardioversion is longer than
with ibutilide.[1] [2]
» Pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs may
be considered in some patients to facilitate the
success of DC cardioversion and reduce risk of
AF recurrence.[150] [151]
» If pharmacologic conversion is attempted
and is unsuccessful, DC conversion should
be considered rather than switching to an
alternative antiarrhythmic agent.[1]
» Selected outpatients who have recurrent
AF may self-administer a single oral dose
of flecainide or propafenone (known as
the "pill-in-the-pocket" approach).[1] [2] An
atrioventricular node-blocking agent (beta-
blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel
blocker) should be administered concomitantly,
to prevent atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction.
Safety and efficacy of this approach in selected
patients should be established first in a
monitored hospital setting.[1] [2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
HF: antiarrhythmic drugs should be used very
cautiously especially in patients with abnormal
LV function and HF. Some antiarrhythmic agents,
such as sotalol, may increase mortality.[157]
 Ibutilide may be used for pharmacologic

» Considerations for patients with comorbid
WPW syndrome: in patients with AF and
WPW syndrome, rapid conduction of atrial
electrical activity to the ventricles via an
accessory pathway (preexcitation) may cause
fast ventricular rates, with an increased
risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden
death.[1] [2] Hemodynamically stable patients
with preexcited AF may be treated with
pharmacologic cardioversion. AV nodal
blocking agents (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem,
amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, beta-
blockers) are contraindicated in preexcited
AF. Hemodynamically unstable patients with
preexcited AF should be treated with DC
cardioversion.

plus estimate stroke risk and consider left
atrial appendage occlusion
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Risk of stroke and thromboembolic events
should be assessed in all patients using
a validated clinical risk score, such as the
CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool.[1] [2] [78]
» Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)
may be considered as an alternative for
stroke prevention when there are absolute
contraindications to use of anticoagulants, or
the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits.[1]
[2] [78] [123] [124] LAAO devices such as
the WATCHMAN™ and the Amplatzer™
Cardiac Plug device may be implanted
percutaneously via transeptal catheterization.
In the PROTECT AF trial, the primary efficacy
event rate (a composite end point of stroke,
cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism)
of the WATCHMAN™ device was considered
noninferior to that of warfarin.[125] There was
a higher rate of adverse safety events in the
intervention group than in the control group due
mainly to periprocedural complications. The
Amplatzer™ Cardiac Plug consists of a small
proximal disk, a central polyester patch, and a
larger distal disk with hooks to anchor the device
in the LAA. It does not require anticoagulation
and a European trial found a 96% success
rate for deployment/implantation but with a
7% incidence of serious complications.[126]
 Another nonpharmacologic approach to isolate
and occlude LAA is to tie off the LAA using
the LARIAT device, which is an epicardial
snare.[127] The WATCHMAN FLX™ device
is a next-generation LAA closure device that
has a greater number of struts and dual-row J-
shaped anchors to maximize device stability.
A prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter
study (PINNACLE FLX) found the WATCHMAN
FLX™ to be associated with a low incidence of
adverse events and a high incidence of anatomic
closure.[128]

guidelines recommend an ideal target weight of
at least 10% weight loss); having a physically

consumption; stopping smoking; controlling
diabetes; and controlling blood pressure/

» Patients with AF should also have their
risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing
(SDB) considered, and screening, diagnosis,
and management of SDB provided where
indicated.[43]
adjunct catheter or surgical ablation
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Catheter ablation may be used as a first-
line option in some patients and in other
patients is used when antiarrhythmic drugs
have been ineffective, not tolerated, or are
contraindicated.[1] [2] [158]
» Isolation of the pulmonary vein is generally
recommended as the target of ablation, unless
another specific AF trigger is identified.[1]
[2] [158] Catheter ablation using either
radiofrequency or cryo energy to create
pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) results in similar
outcomes.[158][159] [160] Additional complex
atrial substrate modification ablation strategies
(e.g., linear ablations to isolate the roof and
the posterior wall of the left atrium, ablation
of complex fractionated atrial electrograms,
focal source, or rotors) may be considered,
but the benefit of this versus PVI alone is not
confirmed.[1] [2][158]
» Randomized controlled trials have
demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation
over drug therapy for rhythm control in select
patients.[161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] 
» Patients with persistent AF who are in AF
at the time of ablation should have a TEE
performed to screen for thrombus. Risk of
thromboembolic events is increased following
catheter ablation and all patients should receive
uninterrupted oral anticoagulation before, during,
and after ablation.[1] [158] Following ablation
therapy, anticoagulation is continued for at least
3 months, or longer depending on underlying
risk factors (such as stroke risk). Rate-lowering
medications and antiarrhythmics may also be
continued, but this will depend on various patient
factors, and the decision is individualized. If
symptomatic AF recurs after catheter ablation,

a repeat procedure often results in a better
success rate.
» Surgical ablation (open surgery, rather
than using catheter techniques) is most often
reserved for those who are having cardiac
surgery for other reasons, such as bypass or
valve surgery (e.g., mitral-valve surgery). It may
also be used in patients with left atrial thrombus,
or it may be chosen by certain patients who do
not prefer the catheter approach, in which case
a minimally invasive surgical approach is often
used.[158][176] The Cox maze procedure is
the conventional surgical approach. Multiple,
precisely placed incisions are made in both
atria, with the aim of isolating and terminating
the abnormal electrical impulses' routes.
The Cox maze IV procedure uses a modified
approach.[177] [178] Alternative methods of
creating lesions in the atria by ablation rather
than incision have also been developed (e.g.,
radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy, and
ultrasound). Hybrid convergent ablation, which
combines minimally invasive surgical (epicardial)
and catheter (endocardial) ablation, may be
considered for patients with symptomatic,
persistent AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drug
therapy.[1] [2] [179]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
HF: patients with AF and HF more likely to
benefit from catheter ablation are generally
younger, have an earlier stage of HF, and have
less severe disease.[174] [175] In patients with
HFrEF(EF ≤40%) factors that should be taken
into account include LV dysfunction, functional
class, comorbid conditions, hemodynamic
stability, ventricular scar burden, duration of
AF, and degree of adverse atrial remodeling.
Catheter ablation has been shown to improve
outcomes compared with pharmacologic
therapy/conventional treatment in patients with
HF and AF.[166] [167]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
CKD: when performing catheter ablation in
patients with CKD, particular attention must
be paid to fluid balance when using irrigated
radiofrequency catheters.[1]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid

preferred in patients with HCM; choice of rhythm
control is individualized. Catheter ablation
may be considered, but is less effective in

» sotalol: 40-80 mg orally twice daily initially
for 3 days, followed by 80-160 mg twice daily
» Long-term use of antiarrhythmic drugs is
considered for maintenance of sinus rhythm
after cardioversion in patients in whom catheter
ablation is not suitable or not preferred.
Pharmacologic maintenance of sinus rhythm can
also be considered while awaiting ablation.
» Adverse effects associated with use of
antiarrhythmics include bradycardia or worsening
of underlying sinus node dysfunction, or AV
block. There is a risk of other arrhythmias
developing with the use of these antiarrhythmics
for AF. Choice of antiarrhythmic agent is
therefore primarily guided by safety, considering
cardiac comorbidities and other risk factors for
proarrhythmic events.[1] [2]
» In patients with normal LV function, no
previous myocardial infarction, and no significant
structural heart disease, dofetilide, dronedarone,
flecainide, or propafenone are recommended.[1]
[2] Amiodarone is an alternative option in these
patients, but it is associated with a range of
adverse effects and drug interactions, so is
recommended only when other antiarrhythmics
are ineffective or contraindicated. Sotalol may
also be considered in this group.[1]
» Although (like sotalol, propafenone, and
flecainide) dronedarone is less effective than
amiodarone for the maintenance of sinus rhythm,
it has fewer adverse effects.[152] [153] [154]
[155] Dronedarone is indicated to reduce the
risk of hospitalization in patients with paroxysmal
or persistent AF and associated cardiovascular
risk factors (i.e., age >70 years, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, prior cerebrovascular accident,
left atrial diameter ≥50 mm, or left ventricular
ejection fraction <40%), who are in sinus rhythm,
or who will be cardioverted.
» Specific adverse effects are more associated
with certain antiarrhythmic agents. For example,
with class Ic agents (i.e., propafenone or
flecainide), conversion of AF to atrial flutter can
occur with a faster ventricular response. This is
due to slowing of the atrial cycle length allowing
faster AV nodal conduction. Indeed, patients
can present with a wide complex tachycardia
simulating ventricular tachycardia due to rate-
dependent conduction slowing in the ventricular
myocardium or a bundle-branch block pattern.
Therefore, patients eligible for the use of class Ic

» Dofetilide and sotalol may cause QT
prolongation and torsades de pointes. These
agents should be initiated within the hospital
cautiously under close telemetry monitoring, and
dosing should be modified based on creatinine
clearance.
» It is important to monitor liver enzymes when
patients are treated with dronedarone and
amiodarone. For the latter, patients should also
have at least 6-monthly assessment of thyroid

» Overall, antiarrhythmic drugs should be used
very cautiously, especially in patients with
abnormal left ventricular (LV) function and heart
failure, as they may increase adverse events.
Some antiarrhythmic agents such as sotalol may
increase mortality.[157]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid HF:
in patients with AF and significant structural

long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm are
amiodarone or dofetilide.[1] [2] Dronedarone
may be considered in patients who do not have
New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV
HF or decompensation in the last 4 weeks.[154]
 Sotalol should not be used in patients with
HFrEF.[1] [2] The ESC guidelines recommend

maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients
with HFpEF, with sotalol as an alternative.[2]
 For patients with HFpEF and AF, the use of

(AF) it is accepted, both by patients and
physicians, that attempts at restoration of

is followed rather than rhythm control.

» The CHA₂DS₂-VASc tool is the most validated
risk score and is most widely used.[1] [2] [78]
 CHA₂DS₂-VASc allocates 1 point each for
chronic heart failure, hypertension, age 65 to
74 years, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease,
and female sex, and 2 points each for a history
of stroke or transient ischemic attack, or age
75 years and older.[99]  The ACC/AHA/ACCP/
HRS and ESC guidelines recommend the use
of oral anticoagulants for patients with AF and
a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of ≥2 in men or ≥3
in women (1 for gender, and 2 for additional
risk factors), which corresponds to annual
thromboembolic risk of ≥2%.[1] [2] With a score
of ≥1 in men or ≥2 in women (1 for gender
and 1 for additional risk factors; corresponds
to annual risk of ≥1% to <2%), the use of oral
anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic
stroke can be considered; additional factors that
may modify stroke risk, such as hypertension
control, can be taken into account.[1] [2] Use of
oral anticoagulants in patients with a nonsex-
related CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 is particularly
important to consider in patients over the age of
65 years.[3]
» Use of any anticoagulation strategy needs to
be balanced with the risk of bleeding, particularly
intracranial bleeding.[100] Scoring systems such
as ORBIT, HAS-BLED, HEMORR₂HAGES, and
the newer DOAC score can help to quantify this
risk and assess how the bleeding risk can be
minimized.[101]  [MdCalc: HEMORR₂HAGES
Score for Major Bleeding Risk] (https://
www.mdcalc.com/calc/1785/hemorr2hages-
score-major-bleeding-risk)   When used in
combination with a stroke risk score such as
CHA₂DS₂-VASc, bleeding risk tools provide
a means to balance the benefits and risks of
anticoagulation with patients. Bleeding risk
scores should not be used to exclude people
from receiving anticoagulant treatment.[1] [2]
[102]
» In patients with cardiac implantable electronic
devices, AF may be detected as AHRE, which
can be silent/asymptomatic. Anticoagulation
therapy for prevention of thromboembolism and
stroke based on subclinical AF has not shown
to be convincingly useful; use of DOACs in the
ARTESIA and NOAH-AF trials was associated
with increased risk of major bleeding.[103] [104]
 In patients who have longer duration AHREs,
are at higher risk of stroke (e.g., measured by
CHA₂DS₂-VASc), and have symptomatic AF,
anticoagulation may be of benefit.[1] [2] [105]

» Oral anticoagulation drugs for stroke
prevention are warfarin or a DOAC such as
dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban.
All patients should preferably be started on
a DOAC, unless they are not eligible (e.g.,
presence of moderate to severe mitral valve
stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves) or
DOACs are not available.[1] [2] [78] DOACs
are generally safe in older patients; however,
dabigatran may be associated with an increased
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with
warfarin.[117]
» If DOACs are used in patients with renal
impairment, they should be used with caution.
Some DOACs may need dose adjustment and
some may be contraindicated. Consult a drug
information source for specific guidance on
use in patients with renal impairment. DOACs
should not be used in combination with heparin
(including LMWH), heparin derivatives, or
warfarin.
» The efficacy and safety of anticoagulation
with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality
of anticoagulation control as reflected by the
average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of
INR 2 to 3. The SAMe-TT₂R₂ scoring system
(based on sex, age, medical history, treatment
interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool that
may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients
who are less likely to maintain TTR >70% and
who should, therefore, be managed with DOACs
instead of warfarin.[118] [119]  [SAMe-TT₂R₂

or a DOAC; and patients with end-stage CKD
(CrCl <15 mL/min) or who are on dialysis may
reasonably receive warfarin or apixaban.[1] In
Europe, DOACs are not approved for patients
with CrCl ≤15 mL/min or on dialysis.[2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid liver
disease: in those with mild or moderate liver
disease (Child-Pugh score A or B), DOACs may
be used over warfarin; however, rivaroxaban
should not be used in moderate liver disease
(Child-Pugh B).[1] [2] There are no data on use
of DOACs in patients with severe liver disease
(Child-Pugh class C). In Europe, DOACs are
contraindicated in these patients.[1] [2] Warfarin
may be used in patients with Child-Pugh class
C liver disease; in high-risk patients (recent
major bleeding, active coagulopathy, severe
thrombocytopenia, or high-risk varices not
amenable to intervention) decision to use is
individualized.[184]

» digoxin: 0.25 to 0.5 mg intravenously as
a loading dose, followed by 0.25 mg every
6 hours (maximum 1.5 mg/24 hours), then
0.0625 to 0.25 mg orally once daily
» In patients with permanent atrial fibrillation
(AF) it is accepted, both by patients and
physicians, that attempts at restoration of
sinus rhythm would either be unsuccessful or
detrimental. Therefore, a strategy of rate control
is followed rather than rhythm control.
» Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil; if
EF >40%) may be used for long-term rate
control, with digoxin considered either alone or in
combination if other options are not tolerated or
contraindicated.[1] [2]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
HF: in patients with AF and HF with preserved
EF (HFpEF; EF >40%), a beta-blocker or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker is
preferred for rate control. Nondihydropyridine
calcium-channel blockers must not be used in
patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; EF
≤40%) owing to their negative inotropic effect.
Digoxin is an alternative option for rate control
in patients with AF and either HFpEF or HFrEF.
The optimal target heart rate in patients with AF
and HF is unclear.
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
pulmonary disease: cardioselective beta-
blockers (e.g., atenolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol)
may be used for rate control in patients with AF
and COPD (other rate control agents may also
be used, but beta-blockers do not need to be
avoided). Beta-blockers should be avoided in
patients with reactive airway disease, such as
asthma.[1]
» Considerations for patients with comorbid
cancer: patients with AF and cancer should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team. Treatments
for AF may be less effective if it is caused
directly by the cancer therapy.[59] Drug-drug
interactions can occur between cancer therapies
and AF therapies. Beta-blockers are preferred
for rate control in patients with cancer and
AF, particularly if the cancer therapies have
potential cardiovascular risk; diltiazem and
verapamil should be avoided due to associations
with negative inotropic effects and drug-drug
interactions.[59]

Emerging
Biomarker-based risk prediction
Like many conditions, there is a growing interest in the roles that cardiac biomarkers play in pathogenesis
and, hence, the treatment aspect of atrial fibrillation (AF). Biomarker-based risk prediction scores, such as
ABC-AF, may become an adjunct to existing scores such as CHA₂DS₂-VASc.[186] 
New technologies for AF detection
Wearables, such as smart watches, can incorporate optical sensors to provide heart rate and rhythm
information, and several studies have evaluated their use in detecting AF. For example, the Apple Heart
Study found around 0.5% of over 400,000 participants received an alert about potential AF from their
smartwatch irregular pulse notification algorithm. Patients who received this alert were followed up with a
wearable ECG patch for up to 7 days. Of patients who returned analyzable ECG patches, AF was present in
34%. For patients notified of an irregular pulse while wearing the ECG patch, there was a positive predictive
value of simultaneously observing AF on the ECG of 0.84 (95% CI 0.76-0.92).[187] Further large-scale
studies are needed to provide clarity on the role of new monitoring technologies in the early detection of
AF.[3] Another emerging area of interest is screening for AF in elderly people with the aim of preventing
strokes, for example by using a hand-held ECG recorder or implantable loop recorder. Results to date are
mixed, with new data expected.[3]
Ethanol infusion
Infusion of ethanol into the vein of Marshall has been investigated for treatment of persistent AF. One
meta-analysis found that compared with ablation alone, ablation with vein of Marshall ethanol infusion was
associated with a higher rate of long-term freedom from AF and comparable safety.[188]
Primary prevention
Primary prevention strategies are based on reducing risk factors through lifestyle modification.[1] [2]
[3] [49] US guidelines now recommend that patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) receive
comprehensive guideline-directed lifestyle and risk factor modification, which includes maintenance of ideal
weight and weight loss if overweight or obese, having a physically active lifestyle, reducing unhealthy alcohol
consumption, stopping smoking, controlling diabetes, and controlling blood pressure/hypertension.[1]
Use of ACE inhibitors, statins, and specific dietary lipid components present in certain types of fish have
been shown to reduce the incidence of AF.[68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] Preoperative treatment with a beta-
blocker or amiodarone reduces postoperative incidence of AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or
in patients at high risk for AF.[1][5]  Nonpharmacologic interventions, including atrial pacing, may also be
considered for prevention of postoperative AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.[74]
In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, optimal management of the condition may reduce AF incidence and
recurrences.[1][2]
Moderate physical activity may prevent the development of AF; however, it has been found that strenuous
activity can increase the risk of AF.[3] [75] It may be appropriate to recommend caution to those who pursue
years of regular, high-volume (≥3 hours/day) high-intensity endurance training; observational data exists
linking this with increased AF risk in men and similar J-curve risk observed for high or vigorous activity in
both men and women in another study.[1] [76] [77]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of AF taken from the ACC/
AHA/ACCP/HRS (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American College of
Clinical Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society) guideline for the diagnosis and management of AF.[1]

Established atrial fibrillation Management
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.
Adult; with risk factors for AF
Risk factors for AF include (but are not limited to): advancing age; smoking; sedentary lifestyle
or elite/extreme exercise; increasing alcohol use; obesity or overweight; increasing height;
elevated blood pressure and hypertension; diabetes; presence of cardiovascular disease (e.g.,
coronary artery disease, heart failure); thyroid disease.
With hypertension
Intervention Goal
Blood pressure control
Optimize blood pressure control using lifestyle
interventions with or without antihypertensive
medication to reduce blood pressure in line with
published clinical guidance on management of
hypertension.
Hypertension is the risk factor with the highest
attributable risk for AF; intensive BP control
lowers the risk of incident AF in observational and
randomized data.
See Essential hypertension.
Blood pressure reduction and prevention of
AF
Follow recommendations on blood pressure targets
for the general population in line with published
clinical guidance on management of hypertension.
With overweight or obesity
Intervention Goal
Weight loss
Follow guideline-directed advice on achieving
weight loss, which may include lifestyle measures
with or without consideration of pharmacotherapy or
surgery.
Management of weight is important in the
prevention and treatment of AF. Obesity results in
direct changes to the atrial myocardium forming
the substrate for AF. In addition, obesity is
also associated with several comorbidities that
have been independently associated with the
development of AF.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss and prevention of AF
Follow recommendations on healthy body weight
targets for the general population in line with
published clinical guidance.

MANAGEMENT
Physically inactive
Intervention Goal
Counseling on maintenance of a physically
active lifestyle
Encourage the individual to engage in physical
activity. A physically active lifestyle is recommended
to reduce the risk of development of AF, particularly
if the person is sedentary.
Increased physical activity and prevention of
AF
Physical activity is recommended in line with
physical activity targets for the general population.
With alcohol consumption
Intervention Goal
GIve advice on safe drinking levels
Counsel the individual to drink moderately (or
abstain from alcohol) and to avoid binge drinking.
It may be appropriate to explain that alcohol
consumption enhances the risk of AF in a linear
fashion, with clear evidence that binge drinking
heightens the risk.
One standard alcoholic drink/day is the maximum
recommended amount to reduce the risk of
AF development, although uncertainty persists
regarding harms or benefits of drinking this amount
daily.
See Alcohol use disorder.
Adherence to safe drinking guidance and
prevention of AF
Advise patients to limit their alcohol intake to ≤1
standard alcoholic drink/day or to abstain from
alcohol.
With suspected or confirmed substance use disorder
Intervention Goal
Consider referral for substance use disorder
treatment
Refer the patient with suspected or confirmed
substance use disorder for treatment as appropriate.
Treatment for substance use disorder may be
beneficial in reducing the risk of AF given that
there is an association of cannabis, cocaine,
methamphetamine, and opioid use with increased
incidence of AF.
See Cocaine use disorder.
See Amphetamine and methamphetamine use
disorder.

With smoking
Intervention Goal
Smoking cessation counseling and/or
medications
Offer guideline-directed management for smoking
cessation encompassing behavioral counseling with
or without pharmacotherapy.
It may be helpful to explain that smoking is
associated with increased risk of AF and smoking
cessation is associated with decreased risk of
incident AF.
See Smoking cessation.
Smoking abstinence and prevention of AF
With diabetes
Intervention Goal
Optimize glycemic control
Follow guideline-directed management of diabetes
according to the subtype of diabetes present,
including lifestyle interventions with or without
pharmacotherapy.
The presence of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes
increases AF risk, with evidence that worse glucose
control correlates with a higher probability of
developing AF.
There is limited evidence to suggest that taking a
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor
may prevent new AF in people with type 2 diabetes,
although the evidence is not strong enough to offer
a definitive recommendation to support the use of
SGLT2 inhibitors for AF prevention.
See Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults .
See Type 1 diabetes mellitus .
Individualized glycemic goal and prevention
of AF
Assess glycemic status at appropriate intervals
in line with the individual’s personalized diabetes
management plan.

Undergoing cardiac surgery
Intervention Goal
Consider short-term prophylactic
beta-blocker or amiodarone; consider
concomitant posterior left pericardectomy in
selected patients
If a patient is undergoing cardiac surgery, it is
reasonable for the hospital team to administer short-
term prophylactic beta-blockers or amiodarone to
reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.
Furthermore, it is reasonable for the surgical team to
perform concomitant posterior left pericardiectomy
to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF in
people undergoing:
• A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
• Aortic valve or ascending aortic aneurysm
operations
New-onset AF after cardiac surgery is common and
has been associated with increased risks of late
mortality and stroke.
Trials of prophylactic amiodarone and beta-blockers
have demonstrated effectiveness reducing the
occurrence of new AF, but not in all studies.

Established atrial fibrillation Management
Initiated on cancer therapy associated with an increased risk of developing AF
Intervention Goal
Consider cardiology referral for evaluation
and optimization of cardiovascular risk
factors
If the patient is taking medical cancer therapies that
increase the risk of incident AF, consider referral
to a cardiologist, as required, for optimization of
cardiovascular conditions.
Implicated medical cancer therapies include:
• Anthracyclines
• Antimetabolites
• Alkylating agents
• Immunomodulatory drugs
• Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
• Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
therapy
• Monoclonal antibodies
Notably, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors,
such as ibrutinib, which are used to treat chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoproliferative
malignancies and often used for an extended period
of time, are associated with a higher risk of AF due
to off-target cardiac effects.
Patients with cancer and AF are on average
older and have higher rates of hypertension,
myocardial infarction, and heart failure compared
with those who do not develop AF. In general,
patients with cancer and cardiovascular disease
may be undertreated with guideline-directed medical
therapy and infrequently referred to specialists for
cardiovascular care.
The presence of raised natriuretic peptides after
major thoracic cancer surgery may indicate a higher
risk of AF.

MANAGEMENT
With bradycardia requiring cardiac-implanted electronic device (pacemaker); with normal
atrioventricular conduction
Intervention Goal
Device selection and programming strategy
to maintain atrioventricular synchrony
It is recommended that the specialized healthcare
team consider:
• using programming strategies that minimize
right ventricular pacing to reduce the risk of
AF, and
• implementing antitachycardia pacing
algorithms (where appropriate) to identify and
terminate atrial arrhythmias, e.g., in people
with organized atrial activation due to reentry.
Reduced incidence of AF
Secondary prevention
US guidelines now recommend that all patients with AF receive comprehensive guideline-directed lifestyle
and risk factor modification, which includes secondary prevention measures: maintenance of ideal weight
and weight loss if overweight or obese, having a physically active lifestyle, reducing unhealthy alcohol
consumption, stopping smoking, controlling diabetes, and controlling blood pressure/hypertension.[1]
Weight reduction with intensive risk factor management has been shown to reduce AF symptom burden and
severity, and result in beneficial cardiac remodeling.[3] [220] [221] [222] Supervised exercise training has
been shown to help reduce AF recurrence, improve quality of life, and improve cardiorespiratory fitness and
functional capacity.[223] [224][225]
Optimal management of obstructive sleep apnea may reduce AF incidence, recurrence, progression, and
symptoms.[2] [43] [226]
Reducing or stopping alcohol intake may reduce arrhythmia recurrences.[3]
Cigarette smoking is associated with poorer outcomes in those with AF, and cessation has been associated
with reduced risk of stroke and cardiovascular events.[227] [228] Optimal control of blood pressure may
reduce AF recurrence and cardiovascular events.[229] [230] [231]
Patient discussions
Patients should avoid any trigger factors (e.g., caffeine, alcohol) and adjust their lifestyle to reduce
cardiovascular disease risk factors where possible.[217] [218] Gait training in patients taking warfarin will
reduce complications of falls. Online patient information from recommended sources may be helpful. 
[UpBeat: atrial fibrillation] (https://upbeat.org/heart-rhythm-disorders/atrial-fibrillation-afib)   [AHA: atrial
fibrillation (AF or AFib)] (https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation)  Shared decision-making
between clinicians and patients may improve patient adherence to recommendations.[219]

Established atrial fibrillation Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
For a patient with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) that is felt to be secondary to a reversible cause, once
that cause has been removed, long-term follow-up may not be necessary after the initial treatment
and evaluation of the AF. For a patient requiring continued therapy due to the assessment of risk of
recurrence, follow-up should include the following general categories:
• Adequate treatment of the associated medical/cardiac diagnosis
• Periodic assessments of efficacy of therapy
• Periodic evaluation for the adverse effects or complications of therapy
• Maintenance and monitoring of adequate anticoagulation
• Re-evaluation of the current therapy if the underlying cardiovascular problem changes or
progresses or the AF becomes permanent.
During initiation of medical therapy, it is important to monitor symptoms and the link between symptoms
and heart rhythm and rate.[79] This can be challenging when the events are infrequent or unpredictable,
but mobile health devices can increase AF detection compared with standard practice (e.g., wearable
mobile devices, 24-hour Holter).[79] Several rating scales are available for monitoring symptoms, e.g.
the Symptom Checklist Frequency and Severity Scale, Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life, and the
University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale, although some are limited in terms of validity testing
or symptom coverage.[79]
As some patients with AF have asymptomatic recurrences irrespective of the therapy (antiarrhythmic
drug or ablation), anticoagulation should be considered long term. Evaluation of AF burden with a Holter
monitor, event monitor, pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator, or insertable loop monitor can be
considered if the patient is symptomatic. This is largely to ensure that ventricular rates are controlled
if persistent AF progresses to permanent AF or the amount and duration of AF episodes change. Any
change in the clinical status of a patient with a history of AF should prompt the physician to look for a
recurrence as the cause of the clinical change.
It is reasonable to monitor cardiac function by transthoracic echocardiograms every 3-6 months in
patients treated with a rate control strategy to assess for the development of AF-related tachycardia-
induced cardiomyopathy.

Established atrial fibrillation Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
complications of surgical ablation short term low
Estimates depend on surgical or "cut and sew" maze operation (rarely performed today) or surgically
performed radiofrequency ablation. The newer energy-based surgical approaches to ablation such as
radiofrequency ablation have a very low complication rate.
anticoagulant-related bleeding short term low
The risk of bleeding varies according to type of anticoagulant and patient risk factors. The definition of
major and minor bleeding is not standard across studies, and the reported incidence of bleeding in the
literature varies.
In cases of major bleeding, idarucizumab is approved for reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran;
it binds specifically to dabigatran preventing it from inactivating thrombin. Recombinant coagulation factor
Xa (andexanet alfa) is approved for the reversal of the anticoagulant effects of the factor Xa inhibitors
apixaban and rivaroxaban. For patients receiving warfarin, treatment with four-factor prothrombin complex
concentrate (if available) in addition to intravenous vitamin K is recommended.[1] [2]
amiodarone-associated pulmonary toxicity long term low
Acute toxicity presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome within hours of administration. Long-
term toxicity causes inflammation and/or fibrosis. Symptoms of an unexplained cough or dyspnea
should raise the question. A chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with diffusion capacity
are recommended. PFTs should be considered as follow-up when using the drug every 6 to 12 months.
Requires discontinuing the drug in most cases.
death variable high
AF is an independent risk factor for death. The relative risk for death ranges from 1.3 to 2.6 and is
increased in female patients.[202] [203] Both AFFIRM and RACE trials demonstrated similar survival rate
between the rate control group and the rhythm control group.[204] [205] In the AFFIRM trial, mortality
at 5 years was 21.3% versus 23.8%, respectively. The tendency toward higher mortality in the rhythm-
control group is explained by increased use of antiarrhythmic drugs and under-representation of younger
patients with normal hearts in these trials. In fact, a controlled trial suggests that restorating sinus rhythm
with ablative therapy improves survival and quality of life compared with medical therapy of AF.[206] In a
600-day follow-up, 6% (38) of ablated patients and 16% (83) in the medical group had died.[206]
As shown in a substudy of the AFFIRM trial (a comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients
with AF), a recent history of smoking among patients with AF was associated with an increased risk of all-
cause mortality. The results did not show any association with all-cause hospitalization.[207]
bradycardia variable high
Can occur due to profound effects on the atrioventricular node while in AF or due to the effects on the
sinus node when in sinus rhythm, particularly in patients with underlying sinus node dysfunction. Can
occur with antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., flecainide or amiodarone) as well. May require changing drug, or
permanent pacing.

Established atrial fibrillation Follow up
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
stroke variable medium
In patients with nonvalvular AF, the annual adjusted stroke rate is 1.9% to 18.2% per year depending
on patients' comorbidities and CHADS scores.[208] Overall, patients with AF have a fivefold increased
risk of stroke.[3] Patients with AF and a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack may be more likely to
have subsequent ischemic and hemorrhagic events than those without previous stroke/transient ischemic
attack.[209] Additionally, those who have an ischemic stroke while receiving oral anticoagulation are at
increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and death.[210]
Strokes in people with AF are often severe, recurrent, and associated with permanent disability and high
numbers of deaths.[3]
Preventing stroke, especially in older patients, is a vital health concern.[211] [212] [213] The challenge of
prevention with either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents lies with balancing reduction of risk of major
stroke with the increased risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial bleeding.[100]
One cohort study concluded that patients with resolved AF remain at higher risk of stroke or transient
ischemic attack than patients without AF and that the risk is increased even in those in whom recurrent AF
is not documented.[214]
hypotension variable medium
Secondary to the vasodilatory effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, as well as
atrioventricular (AV) nodal effects slowing the heart rate. If this occurs, lowering the dose can be
considered. Other causes of hypotension should be sought. If the strategy was rate control only, AV nodal
ablation can be considered for rate control if drugs cause too many adverse effects. Rhythm control can
also be reconsidered in some patients.
heart failure variable medium
May be due to the negative inotropic effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, as well as
some antiarrhythmic drugs. These drugs should be used cautiously in patients with poor left ventricular
function and not at all in patients with overt clinical heart failure until the heart failure is treated and
compensated. This can be challenging, and there is a need to optimize the heart failure regimen.
proarrhythmia associated with antiarrhythmic drugs variable medium
May take many forms depending on the type and drug used. The most dangerous are ventricular
arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes. Occurs with antiarrhythmic drugs that
prolong the QT or with drugs that prolong conduction such as propafenone in patients with underlying
coronary disease. Physicians should know the pharmacology and drug interactions and use the
recommendations outlined in the guidelines for the treatment of AF.
amiodarone-associated thyroid dysfunction variable medium
An unusual complication of amiodarone due to it containing iodine. Common to see elevated thyroid-
stimulating hormone and more common to see hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism unless the
patient has a predilection to hyperthyroidism or a previous goiter. Can replace thyroid hormone orally
for hypothyroidism but usually need to discontinue the drug if hyperthyroid and treat the symptoms of
hyperthyroidism.

Established atrial fibrillation Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
complications of catheter ablation variable low
Complications vary with the technique and experience, and some have decreased with modification of
ablation strategies. They include cerebrovascular events (0% to 4%), pulmonary vein stenosis (1% to 3%),
esophageal injury and fistula (about 0.01%, but probably underestimated), pericardial effusion (usually
uncomplicated) (25%), pericardial tamponade (1%), organized atrial tachyarrhythmias (2% to 20%),
and other rare complications such as aortic root injury and phrenic nerve injury.[215] [216] Most of the
complications are handled acutely. Pulmonary vein stenosis, although becoming less common with newer
techniques, still remains a potential complication. Can present late with dyspnea. Workup should include
computed tomography of pulmonary veins and ventilation perfusion scan. Treatment includes pulmonary
vein stenting, but results are mixed. Best treatment is prevention with good technique.
Prognosis
The prognosis depends on several factors, such as the precipitating event, underlying cardiac status, risk
of thromboembolism, and whether the nature of the AF is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. Almost
25% of patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF progress to a more sustained form within 1.5 years,
whereby heart rate and age are strong predictors for AF progression.[198] Short- and long-term prognosis for
patients presenting with new onset of AF and its relation to heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI)
is poor. One large Swedish cohort study involving patients hospitalized for MI has found a 30% higher risk
of cardiovascular events (i.e., all-cause mortality, MI, and ischemic stroke) among those presenting with AF
(all types) compared with those in sinus rhythm.[199] Patients with MI who also present with AF need close
clinical follow-up.
Studies in patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) have shown that increased burden
of AF (detected by the CIED) is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, including all-cause
mortality.[200] [201]
Asymptomatic clinical AF has been independently associated with increased risk of stroke and mortality
compared with symptomatic AF.[2]

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
