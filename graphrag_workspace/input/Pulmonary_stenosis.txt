Pulmonary stenosis Overview
Summary
Pulmonary stenosis is mostly congenital.
Symptoms range from none to profound cyanosis and the potential for sudden death.
Systolic ejection murmur is present and is loudest over left upper sternal border.
Cyanotic patients are treated with oxygen and prostaglandin E1 prior to diagnostic testing.
The diagnosis is confirmed and severity classified by echocardiography.
Mild pulmonary stenosis is a benign condition requiring sequential cardiac follow-up but no therapy.
Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) is indicated in moderate to severe/critical lesions.
Surgical valvotomy is reserved for treatment failure and contraindication to PBPV.
Definition
Pulmonary stenosis (PS) obstructs the blood flow from the right ventricle (RV) into the pulmonary bed,
resulting in a pressure gradient greater than 10 mmHg across the pulmonary valve during systole. In most
cases PS is found at the level of the valve, but it can also occur below the level of the valve or distally in
the pulmonary arteries. PS is commonly associated with other forms of congenital heart disease.[1] [2] The
increased subpulmonary ventricular pressure may lead to hypertrophy of the RV proportional to the degree
of stenosis. Clinical symptoms range from none in mild PS to profound cyanosis and the potential for sudden
death in critical PS.

Pulmonary stenosis Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Pulmonary stenosis (PS) is estimated to occur in 7% to 12% of all patients with congenital heart disease.
[3] In people with Noonan syndrome, the isolated PS is frequently caused by a dysplastic pulmonary valve
and has an incidence of up to 27%.[1] Compared with white people, black people have an increased rate
of peripheral PS (5.35 vs. 2.45 per 10,000 live births) and a statistical trend toward a higher incidence of
valvular PS (4.48 vs. 3.46 per 10,000 live births).
Etiology
The majority of cases are congenital. Possible embryologic explanations for pulmonary stenosis (PS) vary
from a maldevelopment of the bulbus cordis to fetal endocarditis.[4] [5] Most often, there is a typical dome-
shaped pulmonary valve with a narrow central opening but a preserved mobile valve base. A dysplastic
pulmonary valve, with poorly mobile cusps and myxomatous thickening, is less common (15% to 20%; even
less in untreated adults) and frequently part of Noonan syndrome. In adults, a stenotic pulmonary valve may
calcify late in life.
A genetic abnormality is another possible etiology, as PS is frequently associated with genetic conditions
such as Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (previously known as LEOPARD
syndrome), Williams syndrome, or Alagille syndrome.[6] [7]
Acquired PS is a rare condition associated with carcinoid syndrome, infectious endocarditis, myocardial
tumors, and external compression. Carcinoid heart disease is caused by plaque formation on the endocardial
surfaces of the right atrium and of the right valves, resulting in thickened and immobile valve leaflets.
Pathophysiology
The main pathophysiologic consequence of PS is right ventricular (RV) strain and an increase in RV
pressure. The cellular effect on the RV depends on the timing of obstruction.[8] If the obstruction is present
in a fetus or neonate, the myocardial response is hyperplasia of myocytes and an increase in vascularity.
However, if the obstruction develops within mature myocardium, there is an increase in myocyte size
(hypertrophy) without an increase in capillary network.
Mild to moderate obstruction will in general be hemodynamically well tolerated and is not associated with
cyanosis or cardiac symptoms. In the severe form of PS, clinical symptoms such as dyspnea, exercise
intolerance, cyanosis, and syncope may occur. The right ventricular will eventually fail as the myocardium
becomes unable to support the enhanced work load imposed by the stenosis, and patients develop jugular
venous distention, peripheral edema, pleural effusion, ascites, and hepatomegaly.
Critical PS may occur in neonates if the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by the stenotic
valve is so severe that it leads to cyanosis. The major source of pulmonary blood flow in severely obstructed
patients is through the ductus arteriosus. Once the ductus arteriosus begins to close, blood flow will be
insufficient and the neonate will become hypoxemic.[9]
If there is no atrial or ventricular level shunt, sudden death may ensue due to compromised cardiac output.
[2] Fetal and perinatal factors, including the specific physiology of PS that leads to decreased oxygen
and nutrient delivery to the brain, can critically impact neurodevelopment, warranting early and targeted
interventions.[7]

Classification
Clinical classifications
Anatomic location of obstruction:
1. Valvular
2. Subvalvular (intracavitary/infundibular)
3. Supravalvular
4. Peripheral (branch).
Etiology
1. Congenital
2. Acquired.
Case history
Case history #1
A full-term 3.3 kg newborn girl is found to have a systolic ejection murmur shortly after birth. She is
clinically asymptomatic and fully saturated while breathing room air. She has no dysmorphic features.
Case history #2
A 7-year-old boy with a normal karyotype and dysmorphic features such as webbing of neck, short
stature, and pectus carinatum is incidentally found to have a prominent main pulmonary artery and
cardiomegaly on chest x-ray for respiratory complaints.
Other presentations
Pulmonary stenosis (PS) may also present as critical PS in neonates. Critical PS is associated with
severe right ventricular outflow obstruction and right-to-left shunting of blood at the atrial level, resulting
in cyanosis. The systolic murmur may be variable, is usually prominent, but may be surprisingly soft if the
cardiac output is limited and there is limited blood flow across the stenotic valve. PS may also rarely be
associated with other systemic diseases including intracardiac tumors, neurofibromatosis, and extrinsic
compression lesions (neoplasms).

Pulmonary stenosis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Although patients are often asymptomatic, a clinical diagnosis can be made via the classical auscultatory
findings and confirmed with echocardiography. It is common for patients to survive into adulthood even if
valvuloplasty is not performed. However, with age the valve may undergo fibrous thickening and, rarely,
calcification, which progressively reduces valve motility, leading to increased outlet obstruction and the
appearance of symptoms. The risk of progression is highest during infancy.[12]
History and examination
Most patients present with mild to moderate disease and are asymptomatic. A history may reveal the
presence of risk factors including black ancestry, or rare causes such as a family history of Noonan
syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (previously known as LEOPARD syndrome), Alagille
syndrome, Williams syndrome, maternal rubella exposure during first trimester of pregnancy, rheumatic
fever, endocarditis, or carcinoid syndrome. Severe pulmonary stenosis (PS) presents with exertional
dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, or syncope with exertion. Exertional dyspnea and fatigue develop due to
reduced pulmonary blood flow and right-sided heart failure. Syncope results from reduced pulmonary
blood flow, which can decrease cardiac output due to limited pulmonary venous return. It occurs in
patients without a right-to-left shunt, inspiring the phrase "better blue than gray." Infants with severe or
critical disease may present with failure to thrive.
Physical examination findings include:
• Prominence of the jugular venous A wave.
• Right ventricular (RV) heave noted in the left parasternal and xiphoid region and a systolic thrill
noted on palpation along the left upper sternal border; both are signs of severe to critical disease.
• A long and harsh systolic ejection murmur with or without a systolic ejection click, usually at the left
upper sternal border. Splitting of S2 may also be present. The loudness of murmur is not always
related to severity, but the length of murmur, the splitting and intensity of S2, and the timing of
ejection click (the earlier, the more stenotic) are related to severity. In severe and critical PS there
is usually a long and harsh murmur peaking later in systole. However, in critical PS, the murmur
may be soft due to poor cardiac output. The presence of a lower left parasternal systolic murmur
suggests associated tricuspid regurgitation. A decrescendo diastolic murmur suggests pulmonary
regurgitation.
• Signs of right-sided heart failure, which may be seen in severe disease and are always seen in
critical disease. These include jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, ascites, hepatomegaly,
and dullness to percussion of the chest (due to a pleural effusion).
• Cyanosis, a feature of critical PS produced by right-to-left shunting through an associated septal
defect or a patent foramen ovale. It is detected in the lips and fingers.
Rarely, dysmorphic features may be identified, suggesting the presence of a syndrome associated with
PS. These include:
• Noonan syndrome: features include typical facies of down-slanting or wide-set eyes, low-set or
abnormally shaped ears, and sagging eyelids (ptosis); growth retardation; delayed puberty with
undescended testicles; pectus excavatum; and a webbed and short-appearing neck. See Noonan
syndrome .
• Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines: features include growth retardation, lentigines, ocular
hypertelorism, abnormal genitalia (usually cryptorchidism or unilateral testis), and retarded growth.

• Williams syndrome: features include microcephaly (30%); typical facies of short upturned nose,
flat nasal bridge, long philtrum, flat malar area, wide mouth, full lips, dental malocclusion/widely
spaced teeth, micrognathia, stellate irides, and periorbital fullness; hypoplastic nails, lax skin; joint
hyperelasticity, hallux valgus, contractures, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis.
• Alagille syndrome: features include growth retardation and typical facies of a broadened forehead,
pointed chin, and elongated nose with bulbous tip.
First-line investigations
A standard 12-lead ECG is routinely performed to identify cardiac anomalies that may be associated with
congenital heart disease or valve disease.[13] [14] [15] ECG findings are typically normal in patients with
mild PS. Right axis deviation is commonly seen in moderate to severe PS.[2] Right bundle branch block is
usually seen; the exception is patients with Noonan syndrome, who have left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray is also routinely performed in patients with known or suspected valve disease or congenital
heart disease.[14] [15] Findings may be normal or show a prominent main pulmonary artery. In severe
PS, marked cardiomegaly, right atrial and ventricular enlargement, and decreased pulmonary vascularity
may be seen.
The investigation of choice is a two-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler assessment.[13][15] This
enables visualization of pulmonary valve stenosis, confirming the diagnosis, and classifies the severity
by measuring the transvalvular gradient. A transthoracic echocardiogram is usually performed first-line; a
transesophageal echocardiogram may provide complementary information in adult or adolescent patients.
[13] [15][16]
The severity of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction is classified as follows:[13]
• Mild: peak gradient is <36 mmHg and peak velocity is <3 m/s
• Moderate: peak gradient is 36-64 mmHg and peak velocity is 3-4 m/s
• Severe: peak gradient is >64 mmHg and peak velocity is >4 m/s; mean gradient is >35 mmHg.

Other investigations
Diagnostic cardiac catheterization may be required in some patients to more precisely confirm the extent,
severity, and level of RVOT obstruction.[13] [14] [15]
Critical pulmonary stenosis may occur in neonates if the RVOT obstruction caused by the stenotic valve
is so severe that it leads to cyanosis. The major source of pulmonary blood flow in severely obstructed
patients is through the ductus arteriosus. Once the ductus arteriosus begins to close, blood flow will be
insufficient and the neonate will become hypoxemic.[9]
If cyanosis is present, additional investigations that are required include pulse oximetry (revealing low
arterial oxygen saturation), a complete blood count (reveals an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit if
there is a right-to-left shunt, reflecting erythrocytosis), and arterial blood gases (which reveal low PaO₂).
Imaging modalities such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac computed tomography are
not first-line investigations but can support procedural planning and may be requested by the cardiac
interventionist and/or surgeon.[13] [15]
Exercise stress testing may be used to objectively assess symptoms if considering intervention.[13] [14]

Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler assessment
Severity of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction is defined as follows:[15]
• Mild: peak gradient is <36 mmHg and peak velocity is <3 m/s
• Moderate: peak gradient is 36-64 mmHg and peak velocity is 3-4 m/s
• Severe: peak gradient is >64 mmHg and peak velocity is >4 m/s; mean gradient is >35 mmHg.
Critical pulmonary stenosis may occur in neonates if the RVOT obstruction caused by the stenotic valve is so
severe that it leads to cyanosis. The major source of pulmonary blood flow in severely obstructed patients is
through the ductus arteriosus. Once the ductus arteriosus begins to close, blood flow will be insufficient and
the neonate will become hypoxemic.[9]

Pulmonary stenosis Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
Treatment is guided by the disease severity determined by echocardiogram. See Diagnostic criteria .
Mild disease typically requires no intervention, whereas percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty or
surgical valvuloplasty may be warranted in moderate or severe/critical disease.[13] [17] [18]
In individuals with pulmonary stenosis (PS), those undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary
bypass during infancy are at a heightened risk of developing development delays or disorders, necessitating
vigilant follow-up. Patients presenting with chronic cyanosis without cardiopulmonary bypass in infancy
also warrant close monitoring because they have an increased risk of neurodevelopment challenges.
Additionally, a subset of patients may not display conventional risk factors but still possess an elevated risk
of neurodevelopment issues due to interventions or hospitalizations related to their condition from infancy
through to adolescence.[7]
Mild disease
This form of PS rarely progresses, and although requiring sequential cardiology follow-up into adulthood,
requires no medical or surgical therapy.[13] [18] [19] Patients are asymptomatic and symptoms, if they
appear, should not be attributed to PS but should be investigated further to elucidate the cause.
Moderate disease
In patients with moderate disease, intervention with percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty
(PBPV) is generally recommended.[13] [15][18] Although the Second Natural History Study, which
followed patients with moderate PS over 20 years, reported excellent outcomes with and without invasive
treatment, most experts agree that moderate gradients will eventually progress to severe obstruction and
right heart failure and warrant invasive treatment independently of symptom status.[19] Nevertheless, the
utility of invasive treatment in asymptomatic patients with moderate PS remains under debate, and its use
varies by institution.
US guidelines recommend PBPV as the first-line therapy for moderate or severe PS and otherwise
unexplained symptoms of heart failure, cyanosis from interatrial right-to-left communication, and/or
exercise intolerance.[13] European guidelines recommend intervention in the presence of one or more of
the following: symptoms related to PS; decreasing right ventricular function and/or progressive tricuspid
regurgitation to at least moderate; and/or right-to-left shunting via an atrial septal defect or ventricular
septal defect.[15]
PBPV is determined by invasive cardiac catheterization. It relieves right ventricular outflow tract
obstruction by dilating the valve.[20] The benefits of this procedure are that it is less invasive compared
with surgical valvuloplasty, does not require cardiopulmonary bypass, and significantly decreases
neonatal mortality.
Surgical valvuloplasty (cutting of a constricted cardiac valve to relieve obstruction) is indicated if patients
are ineligible for PBPV, for example if they have a dysplastic pulmonary valve not amenable to balloon
dilation (e.g., in Noonan syndrome) or if they have multiple levels of fixed obstruction (i.e., sub- and/or
supravalvar), or if PBPV has previously failed.[13]

Pulmonary stenosis Management
Severe or critical disease
Prior to echocardiographic assessment, oxygen may be started in patients with cyanosis or respiratory
distress. The flow should be set to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) of 1 with a flow rate of 8 to 10
L/minute in infants. A maximum of 15 L/minute can be given in adults. Cyanotic neonates who are
unresponsive to oxygen can be treated with alprostadil (prostaglandin E1). This dilates arterioles and
maintains the patency of the ductus arteriosus, increasing blood flow to the lungs.[9]
Most experts agree that severe gradients will eventually progress to severe obstruction and right heart
failure and warrant invasive treatment independently of symptom status.[19] All patients therefore require
urgent PBPV or surgical valvuloplasty; the indications and approach are the same as for moderate
disease.[9] [13] [15][18]

In general, patients with mild or residual pulmonary stenosis (PS) following intervention do not need
to restrict physical activities. Patients with moderate PS should avoid high-intensity exercise and static

sports such as climbing or gymnastics. Patients with severe PS should participate in low-intensity
exercise only.[15]
Transition from pediatric to adult care warrants development of a healthcare transition program. This
should emphasize the importance of patient self-management, support patients in improving their medical
knowledge, and be sensitive to the presence of intellectual disability, mental health conditions, or other
comorbidities.[26]

Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients with mild PS do not require therapy but need to be monitored in an outpatient setting
for progression of disease. While mild PS is thought of as a static lesion, studies using color
echocardiography suggest that infancy is the highest risk period for progression.[12] Therefore, patients
need to be monitored annually until 4 years of age, after which clinical visits can range from every 3 to 5
years into adulthood. Less frequent follow-up may be appropriate for adult patients.[14]
Given the potential neurodevelopment impacts associated with PS, incorporating comprehensive genetic
evaluation and neurodevelopment surveillance into the routine monitoring protocol is crucial, especially
for patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or present with risk factors for development delays. This
ensures a comprehensive approach to care that addresses all aspects of the patient's well-being.[7]
Clinical visits should consist of history, physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, and an exercise
test when indicated.[13]
For those who have undergone an interventional procedure, follow-up will depend on the severity of
stenosis after dilation. In general, there will be visits at 6 to 12 months, 5 years, and then every 10 years
postintervention.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
vascular lacerations due to valvuloplasty short term low
Early complication of valvuloplasty; may require surgical intervention.
tearing of pulmonary valve annulus due to
valvuloplasty
short term low
Early complication of valvuloplasty; may require surgical intervention.
arrhythmias due to valvuloplasty short term low
Early complication of valvuloplasty; management will depend on type and severity.
"suicide" RV (dynamic infundibular stenosis post-
balloon or surgical valvuloplasty)
short term low
Dynamic stenosis due to continued vigorous contraction of the RV previously needed to overcome the PS.
Recognized immediately post-procedure due to persistent obstruction to pulmonary outflow.
May require medical therapy with a beta-blocker or continuation of alprostadil for a short period of time
post-intervention, usually less than 2 weeks.
pulmonary valve insufficiency post-valvuloplasty variable high
Invariably, relief of the valvular stenosis results in incompetency of the pulmonary valve. This is due
to stretching of the annulus and failure of the leaflets to coapt. The resulting regurgitation can be mild,
moderate, or severe and requires ongoing evaluation by a cardiologist, with the frequency of evaluation
dependent on the severity of the regurgitation.
In general, pulmonary insufficiency is well tolerated over a long time period.
right heart failure variable medium
In severe PS, the right ventricle (RV) will eventually fail as the myocardium becomes unable to support the
enhanced work load imposed by the PS.
Patients present with symptoms of exercise intolerance, increasing dyspnea, jugular venous distention,
peripheral edema, pleural effusion, ascites, and hepatomegaly. These signs and symptoms indicate that
the condition has progressed to critical PS and warrant immediate referral to a (pediatric) cardiologist.
Although initial management with digoxin and loop diuretics will be directed at the heart failure, urgent PS
treatment (percutanous balloon valvuloplasty or surgery) is required for definitive therapy and to prevent
permanent damage to the RV.

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
sudden death variable low
Occurs due to limited pulmonary blood flow with either profound cyanosis or low cardiac output and right
heart failure.
cardiac perforation due to valvuloplasty variable low
Major complication requiring surgical intervention, occurring in around 0.1%.[23]
tricuspid insufficiency post-valvuloplasty variable low
Major complication requiring surgical intervention, occurring in around 0.2%.[23]
death post-valvuloplasty variable low
Major complication, occurring in around 0.2%.[23]
Prognosis
Mild pulmonary stenosis (PS)
Survival in untreated patients is equivalent to that of the general population.[22]
While mild PS is thought of as a static lesion, modern studies using color echocardiography suggest that
infancy is the highest-risk period for progression.[12]
Moderate/severe/critical PS
Critical PS is fatal in the neonate without intervention.[9]
Percutaneous valvuloplasty produces excellent short- and long-term results in reducing the pulmonary valve
obstruction.[23] Data from more than 26 institutions within the Valvuloplasty and Angioplasty of Congenital
Anomalies (VACA) Registry resulted in an overall acute decrease in peak systolic gradients from 71 to 28
mmHg.[24]
Long-term results of 860 patients followed up for 14 years after balloon valvuloplasty showed that 4 out of
5 were free from clinically significant PS.[23] For neonates with critical PS, the rate of technical success for
this procedure is about 90%, with a 5% complication rate. The freedom from reintervention rate (surgical or
catheterization) has been estimated to be 79%. The study identified the following independent risk factors for
suboptimal outcome: higher initial pulmonary valvular gradient, high early residual gradient, dysplastic valve,
and younger age at intervention.
In a study on patients with nondysplastic valves, surgical valvuloplasty decreased the mean pressure
gradient significantly more compared with balloon valvuloplasty.[25] In addition, surgical valvuloplasty
was associated with fewer reinterventions but a longer hospital stay and led more frequently to moderate
pulmonary valve insufficiency following the intervention.

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
