Overview of dysrhythmias (cardiac) Introduction
Introduction
Cardiac dysrhythmia (or arrhythmia) is a disturbance in the rate of cardiac muscle contractions, or any
variation from the normal rhythm or rate of heart beat. The term encompasses abnormal regular and
irregular rhythms as well as loss of rhythm. Cardiac dysrhythmias are found in a vast range of conditions
and may be defined in a number of ways, including by site of origin (e.g., supraventricular, ventricular, atrial),
mechanism of disturbance (e.g., fibrillation, automaticity, reentry or triggered activity), rate of disturbance
(e.g., tachycardia, bradycardia) and electrocardiogram appearance (e.g., long QT syndrome). Dysrhythmias
may be acute or chronic, and some (especially ventricular arrhythmias) may be life-threatening. Sudden
cardiac death is the most severe manifestation of ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular fibrillation).

Overview of dysrhythmias (cardiac) Related conditions
RELATED CONDITIONS
Related conditions
◊ Focal atrial tachycardia
» see our comprehensive coverage of Focal atrial tachycardia (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/182)
Characterized as a rapid regular rhythm arising from a discrete area within the atria. It occurs in a wide
range of clinical conditions, including catecholamine excess, digoxin toxicity, pediatric congenital heart
disease, and cardiomyopathy. On ECG, P waves are visible before every QRS, and different from the P
waves in sinus rhythm. Onset and termination of arrhythmia are abrupt. Response to vagal maneuvers and
adenosine may be evaluated to exclude alternative diagnoses.[1]
◊ Atrial flutter
» see our comprehensive coverage of Atrial flutter (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/183)
Typical atrial flutter (counterclockwise cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter) is a macroreentrant
atrial tachycardia with atrial rates from 250 to 320 bpm. Ventricular rates range from 120 to 160 bpm, and
associated 2:1 atrioventricular block is common. Characteristic features on ECG are negatively directed
saw-tooth atrial deflections (f waves) seen in leads II, III and aVF, with positively directed deflections in
lead V1. This rhythm is closely related to atrial fibrillation.[2] [3]
◊ New-onset atrial fibrillation
» see our comprehensive coverage of New-onset atrial fibrillation (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/3)
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation
and variable ventricular response and consequently ineffective atrial contraction.[4] [5] New-onset AF is
a new or first detectable episode of a chaotic and irregular atrial arrhythmia. ECG characteristics include:
irregularly irregular R-R intervals (where atrioventricular conduction is not impaired); absence of distinct
repeating P waves; irregular atrial activations.[4] [5]
◊ Chronic atrial fibrillation
» see our comprehensive coverage of Chronic atrial fibrillation (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/1)
Chronic AF is a longstanding chaotic and irregular atrial arrhythmia. It is primarily defined based on
duration and frequency of episodes; therefore, chronic AF could be paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.
AF causes significant morbidity (e.g., palpitations, dyspnea, angina, dizziness or syncope, and features
of heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or stroke) and death.[6] [7] Many patients are
asymptomatic or have symptoms that are less specific for cardiac arrhythmias, such as mild dementia or
silent strokes.
◊ Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
» see our comprehensive coverage of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/
topics/en-us/400)
Occurs when myocardial fibers connect the atrium to the ipsilateral ventricle across the mitral or tricuspid
annulus (accessory pathway), pre-exciting the ventricle.[8] The most common arrhythmias diagnosed
in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial
fibrillation. Typically the heart rate varies between 150 and 240 bpm. Congenital cardiac abnormalities are
strong risk factors (especially Ebstein anomaly).

Overview of dysrhythmias (cardiac) Related conditions
◊ Sustained ventricular tachycardias
» see our comprehensive coverage of Sustained ventricular tachycardias (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/
topics/en-us/537)
A ventricular rhythm faster than 100 bpm lasting at least 30 seconds or requiring termination earlier due
to hemodynamic instability. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined on ECG by the presence of a wide
complex tachycardia (QRS ≥120 milliseconds) at a rate ≥100 bpm. Usually observed in ischemic and
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, but idiopathic VT may also be observed in patients without structural heart
disease.
◊ Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
» see our comprehensive coverage of Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/
topics/en-us/831)
Ectopic ventricular rhythm with wide QRS complex (≥120 milliseconds), rate faster than 100 bpm, lasting
for at least 3 consecutive beats but terminating spontaneously in less than 30 seconds.[9] [10] It may occur
in the absence of any underlying heart disease, but is more commonly associated with ischemic and non-
ischemic heart disease; known genetic disorders such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; congenital heart disease; metabolic problems, including
drug toxicity; or electrolyte imbalance.[11]
◊ Long QT syndrome (LQTS)
» see our comprehensive coverage of Long QT syndrome (LQTS) (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/829)
Characterized by a prolonged QT interval on ECG and may be congenital or acquired. In congenital LQTS,
genetic mutations affect ion channels important in myocardial repolarization.[12] Acquired LQTS may
occur secondary to ingestion of QT interval-prolonging drugs, electrolyte imbalances, or bradyarrhythmias.
An ECG should be undertaken in all suspected cases. Patients are at increased risk for syncope,
ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., torsade de pointes), and sudden cardiac death.
◊ Cardiac arrest
» see our comprehensive coverage of Cardiac arrest (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/283)
Sudden cardiac arrest is a sudden state of circulatory failure due to a loss of cardiac systolic function. Can
result from 4 specific cardiac rhythm disturbances: ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia,
pulseless electrical activity (electrical activity and no cardiac output), and asystole. The most common
underlying causes are ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction.[13] Presentation is usually
sudden and manifests as loss of consciousness but can be preceded by chest pain or dyspnea.
◊ Bradycardia
» see our comprehensive coverage of Bradycardia (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/832)
Any heart rhythm slower than 50 bpm, even if transient, owing to sinus node dysfunction and/or
atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities. Some consider bradycardia to be a heart rate <60 bpm;
however, this is in dispute and most consider rates of <50 bpm to represent bradycardia.[14] [15] Causes
include intrinsic sinus node, AV nodal, and His-Purkinje disease, or extrinsic influences, which may be
reversible. Some patients, even if asymptomatic, may require interventions to prevent life-threatening
complications.

RELATED CONDITIONS
◊ Atrioventricular (AV) block
» see our comprehensive coverage of Atrioventricular (AV) block (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/728)
Impaired conduction from the atria to the ventricles, with various degrees of severity. Signs and symptoms
include heart rate <40 bpm, high (or, less commonly, low) blood pressure, cannon A waves, chest pain,
palpitations, and nausea or vomiting, and hypoxemia. Some patients may be asymptomatic. The degree
of AV block or anatomical level of block does not necessarily correlate with the severity of subsequent
symptoms. Strong risk factors include increased vagal tone, use of AV nodal blocking agents, underlying
cardiovascular disease, acid-base disturbance, neuromuscular disorders, and recent cardiac surgery.[16]
[17]
◊ Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
» see our comprehensive coverage of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (https://
bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/3000308)
A chronic, multisystem disorder that is thought to be due to an autoimmune process. It is characterized
by symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and an increase in heart rate (without orthostatic hypotension)
on standing, in the absence of other causes. It is also associated with comorbidities such as migraine
headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and
autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and celiac disease.[18]
◊ Evaluation of palpitations
» see our comprehensive coverage of Evaluation of palpitations (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/572)
Palpitations are defined as the abnormal awareness of one's own heartbeat. May present in non-life-
threatening cardiac conditions (e.g., ventricular and atrial premature contractions, and supraventricular
tachycardias) and potentially life-threatening conditions (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, and long QT syndrome).[19] [20] Detailed evaluation of palpitations
(e.g., rate and degree of regularity, association with position, presence on awakening) can help diagnose
the type of arrhythmia present.[19]
◊ Evaluation of tachycardia
» see our comprehensive coverage of Evaluation of tachycardia (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-
us/830)
Tachycardia, generally defined as a heart rate ≥100 bpm, can be a normal physiological response to
a systemic process or a manifestation of underlying pathology. Several methods of classification of
tachyarrhythmia are helpful in organizing and assessing tachycardias. These include: sinus versus non-
sinus causes; atrial versus ventricular arrhythmias; narrow- versus wide-complex tachycardias; regular
versus irregular arrhythmias; and classification based on the site of origin of the arrhythmia.
◊ Digoxin overdose
» see our comprehensive coverage of Digoxin overdose (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/338)
Typically presents with components of gastrointestinal, constitutional and/or cardiovascular symptoms.
Patients with acute digoxin toxicity classically have dysrhythmias, which are associated with increased
automaticity and decreased atrioventricular conduction (e.g., atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with high-
degree AV block, nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with block, accelerated junctional rhythms, and/or
bidirectional ventricular tachycardia).[21]
