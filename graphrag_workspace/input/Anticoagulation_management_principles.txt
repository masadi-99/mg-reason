Anticoagulation management principles Overview
OVERVIEW
Introduction
Anticoagulants are among the most frequently prescribed medications in the US.
The most common indications are:
• Stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation
• Prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
• Prevention of valve thrombosis and arterial thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves
Atrial fibrillation affects 700 to 775 per 100,000 people in the US.[1] VTE is a relatively common medical
problem with a yearly incidence of approximately 1 in every 1000 adults and a lifetime risk of approximately
8%. It is estimated that more than 1.8 million people in the US will have VTE by the year 2050.[2] [3] [4]
 Therefore, the number of patients receiving anticoagulants is substantial and is expected to grow with time.
Management of anticoagulants is challenging as they may cause adverse drug events (ADEs), specifically
bleeding, which leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. Anticoagulants are the most common drug class
associated with an inpatient adverse event and have been shown to be the cause of 41% of deaths attributed
to an ADE.[5] Warfarin is the second most commonly implicated drug in emergency department visits for
ADEs in the US.[6] Careful and informed management of anticoagulants is therefore critical.
Anticoagulants inhibit the formation and propagation of blood clots and are used in the treatment of many
conditions. While individual anticoagulants are specifically approved for a number of disorders, the use of
anticoagulants is off-label for others. The level of evidence for use of anticoagulants varies, with a generally
lower level of evidence for more rare disorders.
Anticoagulants can be given either orally or parenterally. Warfarin had been used for more than 50 years
before dabigatran, the first alternative (non-vitamin K antagonist) oral anticoagulant, was introduced.
Since then, many other alternative oral anticoagulants have become available (e.g., apixaban, edoxaban,
rivaroxaban). As these newer agents result in anticoagulation by different mechanisms of action than
warfarin, a new nomenclature was needed.[7] The naming of these new drugs has been controversial
and has evolved over time. Published terms have included: new, novel, or non-vitamin K antagonist oral
anticoagulants (NOACs); target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs); and direct oral anticoagulants
(DOACs). A 2014 survey study administered to 150 leaders of 16 professional societies in North America and
Europe identified DOACs as the favored term.[8] As new therapeutic agents, which target Factors XI and XII,
are emerging, a new nomenclature system has been developed based on route of administration and specific
mechanism of action.[8] [9]

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
Key highlights
• When deciding to initiate anticoagulation therapy, the risk of bleeding should be weighed against the
therapeutic benefits. There are few absolute contraindications; however, anticoagulants should not
be used in patients with active bleeding or in patients in whom imminent hemorrhage is anticipated.
Before administering anticoagulation therapy, the risk of bleeding, as well as any risks associated with
the condition being treated, should be assessed.
• Anticoagulants are often initiated in primary care (e.g., for prevention of stroke and arterial
thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, patients with acute venous thromboembolism who
do not require hospitalization). Initiating anticoagulation in hospitalized patients follows the same
general principles as in the outpatient setting, with the exception that unfractionated heparin and other
short-acting intravenous agents are options for these patients.
• The initiation of anticoagulant therapy differs according to the agent(s) used, and the indication for
therapy. For initial treatment of VTE (“initiation phase”), apixaban and rivaroxaban may be used at
a higher dose, after which the treatment dose (“treatment phase”) is used. Initiation of dabigatran
and edoxaban requires parenteral anticoagulation first for 5-10 days before electing dabigatran
or edoxaban for VTE therapy. Warfarin (and other vitamin K antagonists), when utilized for VTE
treatment, must be given with overlapping parenteral anticoagulant therapy, which is then continued
until the INR is ≥2.0 for at least 24 hours and at least 5 days of overlap has been achieved. In most
patients prescribed an anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation, the treatment dose of the oral agent is started
without the need for parenteral therapy or an initiation-dose regimen. In post acute ischemic stroke
patients initiated on anticoagulation in the setting of atrial fibrillation, a strategy which includes use of
a parenteral anticoagulant for initiation "bridging" may be associated with worse outcomes, so typically
should be avoided in favor of starting oral therapy when the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the
stroke has sufficiently abated.[10] [11] [12]
• Anticoagulation therapy requires regular maintenance and re-evaluation. Warfarin requires the most
laboratory monitoring of any anticoagulant. It is dosed to achieve a target INR value that differs
according to the indication (usually in the range of 2.0-3.5). INR should be performed frequently until
a stable dose is achieved, after which it is typically monitored every 4 to 12 weeks depending on
clinical circumstances. There is no need for routine laboratory monitoring in patients taking direct oral
anticoagulants, though periodic monitoring of renal and hepatic function is suggested.[13] [14] [15] [16]
• The need for elective surgery or an invasive procedure in a patient taking anticoagulants is a
particularly challenging situation. Key decisions include: determining whether the anticoagulant needs
to be interrupted; the timing of interruption; and for warfarin, whether to offer bridging therapy (i.e.,
use of a shorter-acting parenteral anticoagulant, such as low molecular weight heparin, to reduce
the period without effective anticoagulation while warfarin is held). These decisions are based on
the bleeding risk associated with the procedure, as well as the patient’s thromboembolic risk when
anticoagulants are held. Substantial evidence on the timing of interruption and reinstitution of therapy
has emerged, and guidelines inform these decisions.[17] [18] Use of “bridging” injections during
interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy is infrequently indicated and should be used only in highly
selected circumstances.[17] [18]
• Concomitant antithrombotic agents increase bleeding risk. For patients on warfarin and an antiplatelet
agent, more frequent INR monitoring, maintaining an INR of 2.0 to 2.5, and using low-dose aspirin
and clopidogrel as the preferred antiplatelet regimen may decrease the risk of bleeding. The greatest
bleeding risk is in patients that require dual antiplatelet therapy in conjunction with anticoagulation
(also known as triple antithrombotic therapy). There are only a few indications that definitively require
dual or triple antithrombotic therapy. Triple antithrombotic therapy should be avoided in most patients
and, when used, should be continued for the shortest possible period and only in high thrombotic risk
patients.[19] Antiplatelet agents should not be combined with anticoagulants for the purpose of primary
prevention of cardiovascular events. 
• Management of bleeding during anticoagulation requires a comprehensive evaluation and various
interventions to mitigate the risk of morbidity and mortality (e.g., source control, blood products,
nonspecific prohemostatic agents, and reversal agents). Reversal agents may be general (replacing
coagulation proteins) or specific (targeting the antithrombotic drug(s) used by the patients). All reversal

agents carry risks which must be weighed against the benefit of reversal on controlling bleeding. After
bleeding has been controlled, the patient should be assessed and a decision made whether and, if so,
when to resume anticoagulation.

Indications for anticoagulation
Thrombotic conditions can generally be divided into arterial thromboembolism (ATE) and venous
thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulants are indicated in both ATE and VTE for the treatment of existing
thrombosis and for the primary and secondary prevention of thrombosis.
Treatment of existing thrombosis:
• Acute VTE (pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis)
• VTE in unusual sites (e.g., splanchnic vein thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis)
• Intracardiac and left ventricular (LV) thrombus[20]
• Acute coronary syndrome
• Acute ATE (usually attributable to cardioembolism) in arterial sites such as the cerebral arteries or the
extremities
• Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with acute thrombosis

• Thrombosis affecting medical devices (e.g., artificial heart valves, hemodialysis fistulas)
Primary prevention of thrombosis:
• Patients with atrial fibrillation with an increased risk for stroke and other ATE
• Patients with mechanical heart valves to prevent stroke and ATE
• Hospitalized medical, surgical, or traumatic nonsurgical patients at an elevated risk of hospital-
associated VTE, including patients hospitalized with COVID-19[21] [22] [23]
• VTE prophylaxis (post-hospitalization) following: major orthopedic surgeries (i.e., hip and knee
replacement surgery, hip fracture surgery); abdominal and pelvic surgery for cancer; moderate-
to-severe trauma without surgery; and possibly in selected high-risk patients after medical
hospitalization[24] [25]
• Selected patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathies at risk for LV thrombus[20]
• Ambulatory patients with cancer at intermediate- to high-risk of thrombosis (Khorana score ≥2),
receiving systemic therapy[26] [27] [28][29]
• Patients with multiple myeloma receiving thalidomide or lenolidomide-based regimens with
chemotherapy and/or dexamethasone[29]
• Medical devices (e.g., mechanical circulatory support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
circuits)
• Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia until platelet count recovery.[30]
Secondary prevention of thrombosis:
• Patients with a history of VTE for which the risk of recurrent thrombosis is estimated to outweigh the
risks and burden of continued anticoagulation therapy
• Patients with a history of cardioembolic stroke or other ATE in the setting of atrial fibrillation or
antiphospholipid syndrome
• Prevention of recurrent miscarriages (presumed to be related to thrombosis impairing placental
function, especially in antiphospholipid syndrome); although the efficacy of anticoagulants for this
indication is uncertain.[31]
Specific anticoagulants are approved for a variety of indications; complete prescribing information and
society guidelines should be consulted before initiating treatment.
Indications: outcome event assessment
The patient population in which anticoagulation is used is heterogeneous, and the rate of outcome events
(e.g., stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation) that anticoagulation is intended to prevent varies greatly based
on individual patient risk, highlighting the need for individualized risk assessments.
The risk of arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, and
venous thromboembolism (VTE) can be estimated.[32] [33] [34] Formalized risk assessment scores for
the outcome of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation exist (e.g., CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc), and
based on specific patient characteristics, the annual risk for stroke is estimated to range from 0.2% to
>12%.[35] [36] The risk of recurrent venous thrombosis after an initial thromboembolic event varies based
on the presence, robustness, and perpetuity of thrombosis risk factors at the time of diagnosis; it ranges
from a 5-year risk of <3% among patients with surgically-provoked thrombosis, to an annual risk of >15% in
patients with thrombosis and cancer.[37] [38] In patients with mechanical heart valves, the relative risk for
thromboembolism and valve thrombosis among patients taking warfarin compared to no therapy was 0.21
and 0.11, respectively.[33]
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) appear to be associated with a similar or lower risk of major bleeding
compared to warfarin when used for the treatment of VTE or the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial
fibrillation.[32] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] This comparative safety may increase the likelihood
of anticoagulant use among patients who would otherwise not be considered candidates for anticoagulation
and for those patients where the bleeding risk associated with long-term anticoagulation therapy may be
identified as acceptable.[45] [48] [49] [50] Emerging evidence, largely observational, is available comparing

outcomes directly between different DOACs. Large registries which have utilized stratification by propensity
score or other methods to mitigate lack of randomization have suggested similar efficacy between agents,
and a tendency toward less bleeding associated with apixaban use.[51] [52] [53]
An elevated risk of bleeding (see contraindications sections) and thrombosis often coexist.[54] [55] In these
circumstances, a careful discussion surrounding the risks and uncertainties associated with anticoagulation
therapy is warranted. Formalized attempts to measure and qualify a patient’s values and preferences may
inform the role of anticoagulation therapy when there is uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits.[56]
Contraindications: absolute and relative
contraindications
There are few absolute contraindications to anticoagulation; however, anticoagulants should not be used in
patients with active bleeding or in patients where imminent hemorrhage is anticipated.
Relative contraindications to anticoagulation are commonly encountered though evidence suggests that
clinicians overestimate the risk of bleeding and refrain from using anticoagulation therapy in patients who
would benefit.[57] [58] Therefore, before administering anticoagulation therapy, the risk of bleeding, as well
as any risks associated with the condition being treated, should be assessed and balanced. Patients at
elevated risk of bleeding who receive anticoagulants should be carefully educated and monitored.[32] [59]
Contraindications also exist for specific anticoagulants, and the full prescribing information of a specific
drug should be consulted to review these. For example, warfarin is contraindicated in patients with
warfarin-induced skin necrosis; unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
are contraindicated in patients who have a high probability of (or are diagnosed with) heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia; and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be contraindicated in patients who are taking
certain concomitant medications that influence the metabolism of the DOAC or who have specific degrees of
renal impairment.[13] [14] [15] [16] [60] Additionally, pregnancy is a contraindication for many anticoagulants,
including warfarin (for all indications but mechanical heart valves) and the DOACs.
Contraindications: bleeding risk assessment
Bleeding risk should be assessed before deciding whether anticoagulation therapy can be initiated. Bleeding
risk assessment scores are a useful tool to help achieve this.
In patients with atrial fibrillation who are candidates for anticoagulation for stroke prevention, there are
multiple risk factors for bleeding, including advanced age, poorly controlled hypertension, a history of major
bleeding, underlying organ dysfunction, historically poor anticoagulation management, and the concomitant
ingestion of substances associated with an increased bleeding risk such as alcohol, antiplatelet medications,
or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).[61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66]
Formalized bleeding risk assessment scores including HEMORR2HAGES, ATRIA, and HAS-BLED have
been derived, variably validated, and compared.[62] [66] [67] [68] It is recommended that patients with a
higher bleeding risk be monitored carefully, but this higher risk is not a reason to withhold anticoagulation as
the net clinical benefit still favors the use of anticoagulants to prevent stroke in most patients.[69]
[HEMORR2HAGES Score for major bleeding risk] (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1785/hemorr2hages-score-
major-bleeding-risk)
[ATRIA Bleeding Risk Score] (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1718/atria-bleeding-risk-score)
Several bleeding risk scores have been derived in venous thromboembolism (VTE) populations, but routine
clinical use should await additional validation.[70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77]

Initiating anticoagulation in primary care
Anticoagulant therapy will often be initiated in primary care, especially for the prevention of stroke and arterial
thromboembolism in patients diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and in patients with acute venous
thromboembolism (VTE) who do not require hospitalization.
Prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
• Anticoagulants are offered to all patients with atrial fibrillation with a greater than minimal predicted
risk of stroke (i.e., a score of ≥1 in males or ≥2 in females according to the CHA2DS2-VASc risk
assessment method).[69][78] [79]
• Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and warfarin are recommended, with the direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) preferred to warfarin in most patients. Initiation of anticoagulation with loading
doses or initial parenteral anticoagulation are not required for this indication in the absence of known
acute intracardiac thrombus.[10] [11] In patients with renal impairment, a dose adjustment may be
required, or warfarin may be preferred.
Acute VTE
For acute VTE, initial therapy (“initiation phase”) differs from subsequent therapy for treatment of the
thrombotic event (“treatment phase”). Three different approaches to initiating anticoagulant therapy are used
in patients with acute VTE (not requiring hospitalization), depending on the agent selected:
• Loading: a higher dose of an oral agent is given initially, followed by a lower dose thereafter (e.g.,
apixaban, rivaroxaban).
• Switching: a parenteral anticoagulant is given initially, then the patient is switched to an oral
anticoagulant (e.g., dabigatran and edoxaban should only be initiated after 5-10 days’ treatment with a
parenteral anticoagulant and are started when the next dose of the parenteral anticoagulant is due).
• Overlapping: a parenteral anticoagulant and an oral anticoagulant are initially given simultaneously,
and the parenteral anticoagulant is then discontinued once the oral agent has reached therapeutic
levels (e.g., warfarin should be overlapped with a therapeutic dose of a parenteral anticoagulant for a
minimum of 5 days and until the INR is >2.0 for at least 24 hours).[80]
Parenteral anticoagulants that can be used in switching and overlapping regimens in outpatients include low
molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin), fondaparinux, and more rarely, unfractionated heparin,
all administered subcutaneously.[81] The dose of these agents depends on the weight of the patient.
When VTE is diagnosed in the setting of active cancer (cancer-associated thrombosis [CAT]), two options
exist. The preferred option is use of an oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) at the
same dose used for VTE in patients without cancer. An alternative option is extended use of parenteral
anticoagulation with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), without transition to an oral agent.[27] [32] [82]
[83]
In patients with luminal gastrointestinal cancer, apixaban or LMWH may be the preferred options due to a
lower risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding.[32] When extended-duration LMWH is chosen in patients with
CAT, dalteparin (loading regimen) is recommended, while use of enoxaparin for this indication is off-label.[84]
[85] [86]
With the advent of DOACs, primary care physicians may also need to transition patients from warfarin:
• Warfarin to dabigatran or apixaban: discontinue warfarin and start apixaban or dabigatran when the
INR is <2.0.[15] [16]
• Warfarin to rivaroxaban: discontinue warfarin and start rivaroxaban when the INR is <3.0.[13]
• Warfarin to edoxaban: discontinue warfarin and start edoxaban when the INR is ≤2.5.[14]

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
When transitioning a patient from a DOAC to warfarin, frequent testing and a suitable dosing protocol is
required because DOACs may influence the INR.[87] The INR should be checked just prior to the next dose
of the DOAC to reduce the influence on the INR. 
Initiating anticoagulation in acute inpatient care:
initial therapy
Initiating anticoagulation in hospitalized patients follows the same general principles as initiating
anticoagulation in the outpatient setting. The dose of oral anticoagulants for most indications is the same as
the dose in primary care.
Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is often used for initial anticoagulation in hospitalized patients, as:
it does not depend significantly on renal function for elimination; has a short half-life and is readily reversed
if bleeding occurs; and is the agent most studied for use in conjunction with thrombolytics. UFH is also
often used in the inpatient setting for patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, UFH is likely to have
lower efficacy than other anticoagulants, and so should only be chosen for a compelling indication (such as
possible use of thrombolytic therapy, extremes of weight, severe renal insufficiency).[88]
The dose of UFH required to achieve a therapeutic effect differs among individuals, and the required dose
may even change within the same individual. Frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT) is used to monitor and titrate therapy. Target aPTT values must be determined by each
laboratory as they differ according to the instrument and reagents used (the local laboratory determines
these by calibration against anti-Xa activity or protamine reversal studies). The aPTT should be obtained 6
hours after the initiation of UFH. If outside of the target range, the dose should be adjusted and the aPTT
repeated 6 hours after every dose adjustment. Once three successive aPTT values are in the target range,
monitoring can be reduced to once daily.
The dose of UFH and target aPTT depend on the indication:[80]
• Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE): initiated with an intravenous bolus dose, which is dependent
on body weight, followed by an intravenous infusion. Outcomes are improved when the aPTT reaches
the target range (i.e., 1.5 to 2.5 times laboratory control) in 24 hours or less following initiation of
therapy.
• Acute coronary syndrome: initial dose and target aPTT are lower in these patients (i.e., aPTT should
be 1.5 to 2.0 times laboratory control), as they are often at a higher risk of bleeding due to concomitant
use of antithrombotic medications, though are still weight-based.
• VTE prophylaxis: weight-based doses are not necessary for this indication; rather, a fixed dose of UFH
is usually administered subcutaneously every 8 to 12 hours and aPTT is not routinely monitored.
In selected patients, the aPTT may be confounded and fail to reflect the serum heparin level. In these
instances, titration through calibrated anti-Xa activity assays is preferred.[89] As calibrated anti-Xa activity
correlates more closely to serum heparin levels, and has fewer confounding factors than aPTT, some
institutions, especially pediatric facilities, opt for use of anti-Xa assays in all patients. Research has also
shown no observable differences in bleeding or thrombosis outcomes when comparing anti-Xa assays to
aPTT for UFH monitoring.[90] However, anti-Xa activity assays are more expensive and turnaround time may
be longer. Individual institutions generally determine which method is chosen routinely for UFH management.
Less specific dosing information is available when heparin is used for other indications such as post-acute
cardioembolic stroke or in the periprocedural period of cardiac or vascular surgeries. The same dosing
strategy used for acute coronary syndrome is often employed in these settings.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may also be used in this setting for the treatment of acute venous
thromboembolism (VTE), prevention of VTE, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in hospitalized patients.
These agents (e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin) are administered subcutaneously, although an intravenous bolus
may be given initially in selected patients with ACS. The dose is based on weight, differs depending on
the indication, and requires renal dose adjustment for low creatinine clearance.[80] Monitoring with anti-Xa
activity is rarely required. Fondaparinux may also be used for the treatment and prevention of VTE. The dose

depends on the patient’s weight and is administered subcutaneously. Caution should be used in patients with
renal impairment for both classes of parenteral anticoagulants. 
Initiating anticoagulation in acute inpatient care:
transitioning to oral therapy
Patients receiving parenteral anticoagulants in the hospital, and who require ongoing anticoagulation
following discharge (e.g., patients with venous thromboembolism [VTE]), are transitioned from parenteral to
oral anticoagulants, except in select instances when ongoing parenteral anticoagulation with low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred (e.g., pregnancy, patients with cancer-associated thrombosis [CAT]
who are not candidates for an oral Xa inhibitor). The method of transition depends on the indication for
anticoagulant therapy, as well as the oral anticoagulant chosen.
For patients receiving therapy for acute VTE who are being transitioned to warfarin, parenteral
anticoagulation and oral warfarin must be overlapped for a minimum of 5 days, and the parenteral
anticoagulant must not be stopped until the INR is ≥2.0 for at least 24 hours.
For VTE patients transitioning to oral dabigatran or edoxaban, parenteral anticoagulation must be given for
5-10 days first, after which the patient switches to the oral agent.
For VTE patients receiving a parenteral anticoagulant and who will then transition to apixaban or rivaroxaban,
it is reasonable to give the loading dose followed by the approved dose recommendations once the decision
is made to change to oral therapy. No overlap is required.[91]
When VTE is diagnosed in the setting of active cancer (CAT), two options exist. The preferred option is use
of an oral factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) at the same dose used for VTE in patients
without cancer. An alternative option is extended use of parenteral anticoagulation with a LMWH, without
transition to an oral agent.[32] [82] In patients with luminal gastrointestinal cancer, apixaban or LMWH may
be the preferred options due to a lower risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding.[32] When extended-duration
LMWH is chosen in patients with CAT, dalteparin (loading regimen) is recommended, while use of enoxaparin
for this indication is off-label.[84] [85] [86]
In patients with arterial thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation receiving parenteral anticoagulants, the
transition to oral anticoagulation is more controversial. However, it is reasonable to use the same standards
as VTE patients in those with an acute thrombosis.
Initiating anticoagulation in patients with HIT
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) requires inpatient management and unique parenteral
antithrombotic therapy. After diagnosis, many of these patients will receive initial therapy with an intravenous
thrombin inhibitor (argatroban is currently the only approved drug for this indication in the US, while
bivalirudin is approved for use in the setting of cardiac procedures in patients with a previous history of
HIT).[92] [93] Fondaparinux has also been used in patients with normal renal function and HIT; however, it
is not approved for this indication.[94] Data for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is very limited;
they are not approved for this indication although one guideline has endorsed their use.[30] If DOACs are
used in the setting of HIT complicated by thrombosis, it is reasonable to use the VTE treatment dosing
strategy, including the initiation phase.[30] Evidence does not exist to inform the timing of DOAC initiation
however it is reasonable to initiate a DOAC once platelet counts are recovered.
• Argatroban: as with heparin, dose titration, dose adjustment, and monitoring are required. The drug is
given as an intravenous infusion with no initial bolus dose required. Since its initial approval, additional
studies have been published regarding its use and current guidelines suggest a dosing strategy that
differs from the approved dose.[95] The initial dose should be lowered in patients with heart failure,
multiple organ failure, anasarca, or post-cardiac surgery. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
is the preferred test with a target value of 1.5 to 3 times the patient’s baseline value. The aPTT should
be obtained 2 hours after the initial dose. If outside of the target range, the dose should be adjusted

and the aPTT repeated 2 hours after every dose adjustment. Once three successive aPTT values are
in the target range, monitoring can be reduced to once daily.
• Bivalirudin: approved for use in the periprocedural period following percutaneous coronary intervention
in patients with a history of HIT (replacing heparin). It is given as an intravenous bolus followed by an
intravenous infusion which may be continued for up to 20 hours after the procedure. A dose reduction
is required in renal impairment. Dose titration and monitoring are achieved by using the activated
clotting time (ACT) or aPTT. ACT should be obtained 5 minutes after the initial bolus dose to verify
that the dose is adequate; however, the frequency of repeat testing is not well defined. The target ACT
is >300 seconds. The target aPTT is 1.5 to 2.5 times the patient’s baseline value or mean of normal
laboratory range. The aPTT should be obtained 2 hours after the initial dose. If outside of the target
range, the dose should be adjusted and the aPTT repeated 2 hours after every dose adjustment.
Once three successive aPTT values are in the target range, monitoring can be reduced to once daily.
Bivalirudin may also be used for the treatment of HIT; however, this indication is not approved. For this
indication, no initial bolus is required.[95]
Warfarin therapy is challenging in patients on argatroban as the latter prolongs the INR (although this effect
usually diminishes 3-4 hours after argatroban is stopped). Warfarin may be started when the platelet count
has stabilized in the normal range (usually defined as >150,000/mL).[95] Argatroban should be overlapped
with warfarin for at least 5 days and should be discontinued only when the INR (based on warfarin alone) has
been at least 2.0 for 24 hours. One specific strategy that has been suggested is: administer the two drugs
together until the INR is ≥4.0, discontinue argatroban and obtain INR 4 hours later, then resume argatroban
at the preceding dose once the specimen has been obtained. If the INR is ≥2.0 on two successive days
using this monitoring strategy, discontinue argatroban and continue warfarin alone. If the INR is <2.0, adjust
warfarin dose upward and repeat the same testing strategy until two INR values of ≥2.0 have been obtained
while argatroban is held. Similar challenges may present when bridging to warfarin with bivalirudin and a
strategy of targeting a slightly higher initial INR may be warranted.[96] Use of DOAC rather than warfarin for
ongoing anticoagulation following platelet recovery averts this challenge, and is endorsed by guidelines.[30]
See Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia .
Warfarin initiation protocols
Three strategies can be used to select the initial dose of warfarin:
• Clinical algorithm: calculates the estimated stable and starting dose based on several patient
characteristics.[97] Clinical variables that predict a higher warfarin dose include: age <55 years; male
sex; African-American ethnicity; vitamin K intake >400 micrograms/day; and patient body weight >91
kg.[98] Older age and the presence of comorbidities predict a lower dose requirement.[99] Ethnicity
may also influence dose (e.g., mean weekly total dose was 24 mg for Asian-Americans, 31 mg for
Hispanics, 36 mg for Caucasians, and 43 mg for African-Americans in one study).[100]
• Genetic algorithm: calculates the estimated stable and starting dose based on the results of genetic
tests such as CYP450-2C9 genotype and VKOR-C1 haplotype, as well as clinical variables. While
the prescribing information for warfarin suggests dose adjustment based on genetic information,
randomized trials have found conflicting information regarding the value added by genetic testing.
A meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials that enrolled over 5000 patients noted improved time
in therapeutic range, and fewer bleeding events, when warfarin was initiated using a genetic
algorithm.[101] However, there was no difference in other outcomes, including mortality. Guidelines do
not support the use of genetic information for dosing.[102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107]
• Fixed dose: initiation nomograms based on starting doses of 5 mg/day or 10 mg/day resulted in similar
outcomes, with the 5 mg/day starting dose performing better (i.e., more rapid achievement of INR) in
older, frail inpatients, and the 10 mg/day dose performing better in younger, healthier outpatients.[108]
[109] While a fixed-dose strategy has the advantage of simplicity, clinical algorithms result in fewer
dose adjustments and out-of-range INR values.
A baseline INR should be obtained prior to initiating warfarin to evaluate for any underlying coagulopathies
that might justify a lower warfarin starting dose. It is recommended that the INR be monitored daily
for inpatients and every few days for outpatients until a therapeutic INR and stable warfarin dose is
reached.[103]

[Warfarin dosing] (http://www.warfarindosing.org/Source/Home.aspx)
Maintenance therapy: venous thromboembolism
Guidelines recommend that all patients with new venous thromboembolism (VTE) remain on anticoagulant
therapy for a period of at least 3 months, known as the treatment phase, unless strongly contraindicated
(e.g., actively bleeding, very high-risk lesion for bleeding). The goals of this phase are to fully stabilize the
original thrombus so that it is no longer prone to propagation or embolization, and to allow onset, and in
some cases completion, of recovery from the original event.[32] Anticoagulants do not have significant
thrombolytic properties, and dissolution of the original thrombus via the intrinsic fibrinolytic system can take
longer than 3 to 6 months.[110]
Upon completion of the treatment phase, the patient should be reassessed to determine whether
anticoagulant therapy should be stopped or extended (i.e., therapy with no planned stop date), with the
goal of preventing new VTE events. Determining whether to enter into an extended phase of therapy
is very challenging; the decision ultimately comes from estimating the risk of a recurrent event without
anticoagulation against the risk of major bleeding with therapy, cost, and the inconveniences of continuing
therapy. While this decision should always be personalized and informed by the values and preferences of
the patient, guidelines provide recommendations to assist in this decision-making process. See Deep Vein
Thrombosis  and Pulmonary Embolism .
Type of VTE episode
• VTE following major transient provocation (e.g., surgery): anticoagulation should be stopped at the
conclusion of the treatment phase.
• VTE following nonsurgical transient risk factor (e.g., estrogen therapy): anticoagulation should
be stopped at the conclusion of the treatment phase in patients with high bleeding risk; suggest
that anticoagulation be stopped at the conclusion of the treatment phase in patients with low-to-
moderate bleeding risk, although some guidelines suggest anticoagulation be continued for secondary
prevention in this group.[32] [111]
• VTE without apparent precipitating factors (unprovoked VTE): anticoagulation should be stopped at
the conclusion of the treatment phase in patients with high bleeding risk; suggest that anticoagulation
be continued into the extended phase in patients with low-to-moderate bleeding risk.
• Recurrent VTE without apparent precipitating factors (unprovoked VTE): anticoagulation should be
continued into the extended phase (no planned stop date) in patients with low-to-moderate bleeding
risk. Anticoagulation should be stopped at the conclusion of the treatment phase in patients with high
bleeding risk.
• VTE in the setting of persistent (non-transient) risk factor: anticoagulation should be continued into the
extended phase (no planned stop date) in patients with low-to-moderate bleeding risk. Anticoagulation
should be stopped at the conclusion of the treatment phase in patients with high bleeding risk.
• VTE in the setting of cancer: anticoagulation should be continued into the extended phase (no planned
stop date; until cancer is no longer active) in patients with low-to-moderate bleeding risk; consider
continuing anticoagulation into the extended phase in patients with high bleeding risk.[27] [32] [83]
There are important caveats and limitations to the decision-making process. The classification of the
bleeding risk is imprecise. Several bleeding risk scores have been derived in VTE populations, and
professional societies have provided guidance, but routine clinical use should await additional validation.[70]
[71] [72] [73] [74][75] [76] [77] [112] Risk prediction models derived in atrial fibrillation patients have uncertain
performance in the VTE population. Guidance statements do not address all possible clinical scenarios
(such as recurrent episodes of provoked VTE), and the data supporting these statements were derived from
studies covering cases of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and so
may not apply to VTE in less common sites.

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
Extended phase anticoagulation implies no specific stop date, but trials assessing the benefit of this practice
have generally followed patients for only 2 to 4 years. The balance of risks and benefits of anticoagulation
beyond this timeframe is uncertain.[32]
While unprovoked VTE carries a high risk for recurrence, not all patients will have a new event if
anticoagulation is stopped. Several strategies have been explored to identify subgroups of unprovoked
VTE patients who can safely stop anticoagulation. One of these, the HER-DOO2 Risk Prediction score,
has undergone both internal and external validation, and has been studied prospectively.[113] However,
D-dimer is a component of this score and it is unclear if the same performance occurs with different D-
dimer assays.[114] As of yet, none of the other scoring systems are widely validated or recommended by
current guidelines.[115] [116] [117] Likewise, laboratory tests (such as D-dimer), and residual thrombosis
on ultrasound have been studied but have limited ability to identify patients who are at low risk for recurrent
thrombosis.[116] [118]
When selecting patients for possible extended therapy, several factors are important to consider:
• The decision is not permanent and should be re-evaluated regularly (i.e., at least annually and with
major changes in patient health).[32]
• The case-fatality rate of recurrent VTE is less than that of a major bleeding episode and this is also
true in patients with cancer.[119] [120]
• The results of hereditary thrombophilia testing are controversial. With the exception of specific
clinical scenarios, results should not be used to determine whether to offer or withhold extended
anticoagulation as they are not adequately predictive.[121] [122] [123]
• Patient values and preferences must always be a strong component of this decision.[32]
See Deep vein thrombosis  and Pulmonary embolism .
Maintenance therapy: atrial fibrillation
For stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, as with venous thromboembolism (VTE), the decision to offer
anticoagulation includes an assessment of the stroke risk in the absence of anticoagulation versus the risk of
bleeding with therapy.
Risk prediction systems have been developed and externally validated for both of these risks; however,
stroke and bleeding share many common risk factors.[78] [124] The risk of stroke increases with age to a
more substantial degree than the risk of bleeding, and the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation increases
as the patient ages. Therefore, once it has been decided to start therapy, it is generally with the intent of
continuing it indefinitely. 
Regular re-evaluation is recommended as a bleeding event or patient preference may influence this decision.
An increased predicted bleeding risk (using a prediction model) should be addressed with close monitoring
and follow-up.[69] [125]
Neither ablation procedures nor medical treatment (e.g., rate or rhythm control) of atrial fibrillation alter
the decision to offer and continue anticoagulant therapy.[69] Left atrial appendage closure procedures,
either with a percutaneous device or with surgery, offer a means to discontinue anticoagulant therapy in
many patients; though a period of antithrombotic therapy of several weeks is required following the closure
procedure.[126]
See Chronic atrial fibrillation .
Maintenance therapy: clinical re-evaluation
After initiating treatment, anticoagulation therapy requires regular maintenance and re-evaluation. Some
agents, most notably warfarin, require regular laboratory monitoring to ensure therapeutic levels are
maintained during the treatment period.

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
CONTENTS
Five major principles have been proposed to assure high-quality ongoing management of
anticoagulation:[127]
• Verify that the patient is taking the medication correctly. For example, regularly ensure that the patient
understands the purpose of the medication, the proper dose and timing of the dose, whether the
medication needs to be taken with or without food, and that the drug remains affordable to them.
• Ensure that any interruptions to therapy are managed appropriately. Determining whether and when to
resume anticoagulant therapy following a significant bleeding episode is challenging.
• Review and manage any concomitant medications to reduce the risk of important drug interactions and
the bleeding risk.
• Ensure that the dose is prescribed correctly and is modified for clinical changes (e.g., changes in renal
function).
• In older patients, optimize blood pressure control to reduce the risks of an intracranial bleed from
hypertension or falls from hypotension.
It is also important to review the patient’s values and willingness to continue therapy.[128]
Monitoring: general principles
The type and intensity of laboratory monitoring varies widely among the different available anticoagulant
agents. However, monitoring does not refer only to laboratory testing but to reviewing the clinical status
of the patient and monitoring for circumstances that may impact anticoagulant management. There is no
definitive schedule for the frequency of clinical visits after diagnosis and treatment initiation of anticoagulants.
Patients with a good understanding of the disease and its management may only require annual visits.
Patients at higher bleeding risk or with comorbidities may benefit from more frequent follow-up. Evaluation
may include episodes of bleeding, hospitalization, planned invasive procedures, and medication adherence,
as well as changes in health status, concomitant medications, diet, activity level, and other factors (e.g.,
the practicalities of regular monitoring from the patient’s point of view). Monitoring of the patient’s clinical
status is advocated regardless of the anticoagulant being used.[127] Reminder systems are associated with
enhanced adherence.[129]
Monitoring: warfarin
Warfarin requires the most laboratory monitoring of any oral anticoagulant. Response to therapy is monitored
using the prothrombin time, which is then mathematically transformed into the international normalized ratio
(INR), so that values performed at different laboratories produce comparable results.[130] The quality of
warfarin management is most commonly measured by calculating the time in the therapeutic range (TTR)
expressed as a percentage, with higher values correlated to better patient outcomes.[130] [131]
Warfarin is dosed to achieve a target INR value which differs according to the indication:
• Standard range (INR target 2.5, range 2.0 to 3.0): most indications.[130]
• High range (INR target 3.0, range 2.5 to 3.5): stroke prevention in patients with mechanical mitral
valves; or patients with mechanical aortic valves and additional risk factors.[132]
Frequency of testing
• INR should be performed frequently until a stable dose is achieved. This is defined as two successive
INR values in the target range separated by at least 7 days with no change in dose.[104] Frequency of
initial testing ranges from daily (e.g., inpatients) to two to three times per week (e.g., outpatients).[108]
[109] Frequency should decrease as a stable dose is approached.
• Once a stable dose has been achieved, the INR is typically monitored every 4 weeks.[133] When
the INR has been stable for a long time (e.g., all INR values within the target range for at least 6-12
months), it can be measured at longer intervals (e.g., every 12 weeks).[130]

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
• Frequency of testing should increase when the dose is altered or the INR goes out of range. A recall
interval of 7 days resulted in better outcomes compared to longer intervals after an out-of-range
value.[134] One guideline recommends refraining from adjusting the dose when a single INR value
is minimally out of range (i.e., ≤0.5 below or above the target value); however, persistent mildly out-
of-range values should prompt a dose adjustment.[135] Another study achieved a longer time in the
therapeutic range with a fixed-dose adjustment for mildly out-of-range values without an apparent
cause. The weekly warfarin dose was increased by 15% if the INR was 1.51 to 1.99, and decreased by
10% if the INR value was 3.01 to 3.99.[136]
• Frequency of testing should also increase when a drug known to interact with warfarin is started,
discontinued, or the dose of that drug is changed.
• Several factors are associated with unstable INR control, including: hepatic dysfunction; changes in
thyroid function; fever; cigarette smoking; chewing tobacco; heart failure exacerbations; presence
of end-stage renal disease; acute illness; hospitalization; chemotherapy; and prolonged vomiting or
diarrhea. These circumstances may warrant more frequent monitoring.[103] A clinical prediction score
(SAMe-TT2R2 score) based on patient sex, age, medical history, treatment strategy, tobacco use,
and race, has been developed to identify these patients at initiation. Prediction of poor INR control
may favor the choice of a direct oral anticoagulant (if not contraindicated) over warfarin.[137]  [SAMe-
TT2R2 score] (http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/resources/tools/same-tt2r2.html)  Nonadherence to warfarin is
also a major factor that affects INR stability.[138]
Venues for monitoring
• Clinics: warfarin is often managed in specialized clinics. Guidelines suggest that these are preferred
over standard medical practices, though such services may not be available to all patients.[139] When
managed in a standard clinic setting, it is important that a systematic method of management, patient
tracking, and reminder systems are in place.[130]
• Patient self-testing: patients may perform INR testing without a medical visit, using point-of-care
devices. A medical provider is contacted with the result, and the provider communicates any dose
instructions and recall interval to the patient. Outcomes are at least as good as those achieved in
dedicated anticoagulation clinics, and patient satisfaction is high.[103] [140] [141] [142] INR testing is
generally performed weekly in the self-testing environment.
• Patient self-management: in addition to testing with a point-of-care device, patients may also be taught
to perform their own dose adjustments. While outcomes have been favorable in studies, patients
were highly selected and extensively trained with a significant percentage of patients unable to meet
self-management qualifications.[142] [143] [144] This approach is best reserved for highly selected
patients, and for systems experienced in working with such patients.
The Anticoagulation Forum Centers of Excellence are a professional society that offer resources to clinics to
assist with managing warfarin therapy and recognizes those that have achieved a high set of standards.

Monitoring: parenteral anticoagulants
Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
• Frequent measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to monitor and
titrate dose. Target aPTT values must be determined by each laboratory as they differ according to the
instrument and reagents used. The aPTT should be obtained 6 hours after the initial dose. If outside
of the target range, the dose should be adjusted and the aPTT repeated 6 hours after every dose
adjustment. Once three successive aPTT values are in the target range, monitoring can be reduced
to once daily. Target aPTT depends on indication: 1.5 to 2.5 times laboratory control in acute venous
thromboembolism (VTE), and 1.5 to 2.0 times laboratory control in acute coronary syndrome.[80] In
selected patients, the aPTT may be confounded and fail to reflect the serum heparin level. In these
instances, titration through calibrated anti-Xa activity assays is preferred.[89] Research has shown no
observable differences in bleeding or thrombosis outcomes when comparing anti-Xa assays to aPTT

for UFH monitoring.[90] Some institutions, especially pediatric facilities, opt for use of anti-Xa assays in
all patients. Platelet counts should be monitored regularly.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
• Quantitative monitoring of anti-Xa activity can be performed, but is seldom indicated, and has not
consistently been associated with clinically relevant outcomes.[80] Renal function should be monitored
periodically and platelet counts should be monitored regularly.
Fondaparinux
• Quantitative monitoring of fondaparinux-specific anti-Xa activity can be performed, but is seldom
indicated.[80] Renal function should be monitored periodically.
Bivalirudin
• Dose titration and monitoring are achieved using the activated clotting time (ACT) or aPTT. The ACT
should be obtained 5 minutes after the initial bolus dose to verify that the dose is adequate; however,
the frequency of repeat testing is not well defined. Target ACT is >300 seconds. Target aPTT is 1.5
to 2.5 times the patient’s baseline value or mean of normal laboratory range. The aPTT should be
obtained 2 hours after the initial dose. If outside of the target range, the dose should be adjusted and
the aPTT repeated 2 hours after every dose adjustment. Once three successive aPTT values are in
the target range, monitoring can be reduced to once daily.
Argatroban
• The aPTT is the preferred test with a target of 1.5 to 3 times the patient’s baseline value. aPTT should
be obtained 2 hours after the initial dose. If outside of the target range, the dose should be adjusted
and the aPTT repeated 2 hours after every dose adjustment. Once three successive aPTT values are
in the target range, monitoring can be reduced to once daily.
Monitoring: direct oral anticoagulants
There is no need for laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect in patients taking direct acting
anticoagulants (DOACs) due to the predictability of their effect. However, there may be clinical circumstances
where determining the anticoagulant level of a DOAC is desirable (e.g., major bleeding, need for an urgent
invasive procedure, new thrombosis despite treatment, or suspected overdose or nonadherence). Monitoring
may be helpful when co-administration of an interacting drug is being considered.[87] [145] Finally, there
is little evidence for the safety and effectiveness of DOACs at very low body weight (i.e., <50 kg), and
monitoring may be helpful in these patients.[87]
A therapeutic level for DOACs is not supported by evidence, as drug levels have not been correlated directly
to important patient outcomes. However, the term "on-therapy" has been proposed, with above on-therapy
and below on-therapy reflecting very high and very low drug levels, respectively.[146] Standard coagulation
time tests have substantial limitations with DOACs and, at best, can only provide a qualitative assessment of
DOAC levels depending on the agent, test, and circumstances. This qualitative information may be sufficient
for the clinical need in some instances, for example, excluding on-therapy and above on-therapy levels of a
drug in a patient needing an urgent procedure.[87] [146]

Qualitative laboratory measurement of direct oral anticoagulants with standard tests
Produced by SM Stevens, MD and SC Woller, MD; used with permission
Quantitative testing requires the use of specialized testing such as calibrated anti-Xa activity for oral Xa
inhibitors, and ecarin clotting time or dilute thrombin time for dabigatran. These tests are not widely available
and results may not be available in a timely manner.[146]
Renal function should be monitored annually in patients with normal renal function and more frequently in
patients with renal impairment. DOACs are contraindicated at different degrees of hepatic impairment as
determined by the Child-Pugh classification.[13] [14] [15] [16] Patients with known or suspected hepatic
disorders should undergo periodic liver function testing.
Surgery/procedure in anticoagulated patient: general
principles
The need for elective surgery or an invasive procedure in a patient taking anticoagulants is a particularly
challenging situation. The primary approach to management is to select the agent, dose, and timing that
results in the lowest risk of both bleeding and recurrent thrombosis. Key decisions include: determining
whether the anticoagulant needs to be interrupted; the timing of interruption; and for warfarin, whether to
offer bridging therapy (i.e., use of a shorter-acting parenteral anticoagulant, such as low molecular weight
heparin, to reduce the period without effective anticoagulation while warfarin is held). These decisions are

based on the bleeding risk associated with the procedure, which can be classified as high, low/moderate, or
minimal, and for warfarin, the underlying risk of thrombosis. Substantial evidence on the timing of interruption
and reinstitution of therapy has emerged, and guidelines inform these decisions.[17] [18] [87]
Risk stratification for procedural bleed risk (* No residual anticoagulant effect at the time of procedure [i.e.,
four to five drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure]; † Includes spinal and epidural anesthesia or any
other neuraxial [e.g., pain management] intervention; consider not only absolute risk for major bleeding but
potentially devastating consequences of epidural bleeding and associated lower limb paralysis; ‡ Some residual
anticoagulant effect allowed [i.e., two to three drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure]; § Radial approach may
be considered minimal bleed risk compared with femoral approach; ¶ Procedure can be safely done under full-
dose anticoagulation [may consider holding DOAC dose day of procedure to avoid peak anticoagulant effects])
Douketis JD et al. Chest. 2022 Nov;162(5):e207-43; used with permission
Certain procedures, such as selected ophthalmologic, dental, and dermatologic procedures, are thought to
carry such a low risk of bleeding that anticoagulation need not be interrupted at all.[18] [147] Better outcomes
have been reported when warfarin is not interrupted for pacemaker placement or catheter ablation for atrial
fibrillation.[148] [149]
Due to its pharmacokinetics, interrupting warfarin therapy means that there is a period of several days where
the patient will not receive sufficient anticoagulation. However, high-quality data have revealed an increase in
the risk of bleeding when bridging therapy with parenteral anticoagulants is used, with no reduction in the risk
of thrombosis.[150] [151] [152] [153] Newer guidelines and guidance statements suggest that bridging should
be offered to fewer patients than suggested in previous recommendations.[18] [107][147]
Given the shorter half-lives of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared to warfarin, bridging therapy is
not recommended.[18] [87][147] Interruption and resumption of DOACs for surgery and invasive procedures
is generally based on inferences from the agents’ pharmacokinetics, although clinical trials reporting
the effect of interruption strategies for dabigatran have been published.[154] [155] [156] An electronic

High thrombosis risk is defined as follows:[18]
• Mechanical heart valve patients:
◊ Any mechanical mitral valve
◊ Caged ball or tilting disc valve in mitral/aortic position
◊ Recent (<3 months) stroke or TIA.
• Atrial fibrillation patients:
◊ CHADS2 score of 5 or 6
◊ CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 7 or more
◊ Recent (<3 months) stroke or TIA
◊ Rheumatic valve disease.
• Venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients:
◊ Recent (<3 months and especially 1 month) VTE
◊ Severe thrombophilia (deficiency of protein C, protein S or antithrombin, homozygous factor
V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation or double heterozygous for each mutation, multiple
thrombophilias)
◊ Antiphospholipid antibodies
◊ Associated with vena cava filter
◊ Active cancer associated with high VTE risk (including pancreatic cancer, myeloproliferative
disorders, primary brain cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer).
Bleeding risk of the surgical procedure should be assessed. If the bleeding risk is minimal (e.g., selected
ocular, dental, and dermatologic procedures) or data support continued anticoagulation (e.g., pacemaker
placement, catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation), continue anticoagulant at the usual dose. For warfarin,
make sure that the INR is not above the target range, and if it is, the procedure should be delayed until the
INR is in the target range. If the bleeding risk is other than minimal, the decision depends on the specific
anticoagulant being used.

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
• If a patient is receiving UFH, this should be held 4-6 hours prior to procedure start time, and a normal
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) verified before surgery is started.[151] It can be resumed
once hemostasis is secure and risk of post-procedure bleeding has abated (i.e., commonly 24-72
hours post-procedure). Heparin is generally resumed at the last rate of infusion the patient received
pre-operatively and without an initial bolus. 
Warfarin
• Low risk of thrombosis: do not use bridging low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Hold warfarin for
5-6 days prior to procedure. Some practitioners choose to verify that the INR is acceptable (generally
≤1.4) prior to surgery; but an observational study of 224 patients where warfarin was interrupted 5
days before surgery found that only 7% had an INR of 1.5 or greater before the procedure.[161] 
• Intermediate risk of thrombosis: guidelines advise against the use of low molecular weight heparin
during warfarin interruption. Management is the same as for low risk of thrombosis.
• High risk of thrombosis: bridging with parenteral anticoagulant is suggested. Hold warfarin for 5-6 days
prior to procedure. Begin full-dose LMWH 3 days prior to procedure. Stop LMWH 24 hours before
planned procedure start time (the last preprocedure dose of LMWH should be one-half of the full daily
dose if once-daily enoxaparin or dalteparin is being used). Some practitioners choose to verify that the
INR is acceptable (generally ≤1.4) prior to surgery.
• Post-procedure resumption: because there is a delay of several days before warfarin exerts a
substantial anticoagulant effect, it is generally resumed the evening following the procedure (or
as soon as the patient is able to take oral medications) at the patient’s usual dose. LMWH exerts
an immediate effect and timing of post-procedure resumption depends on the bleeding risk of the
procedure. Resume LMWH postoperatively once hemostasis is secure and risk of post-procedure
bleeding has abated (commonly 24 hours after procedures with low bleeding risk, and 48-72 hours
for higher bleeding risk procedures). Prophylactic dose LMWH can be considered earlier if full-
dose LMWH is delayed. The decision to resume LMWH should always be made in conjunction with
the proceduralist to assure that an adequate assessment of bleeding risk has been undertaken.
Discontinue LMWH when INR has returned to the target range.
• Peri-procedural warfarin dosing and timing: an American College of Chest Physicians guideline has
made specific recommendations regarding warfarin interruption. These include: holding warfarin for
≥5 days before procedures requiring interruption; refraining from vitamin K administration when INR is
elevated 1-2 days prior to the procedure; resuming warfarin within 24 hours following the procedure;
and resuming at the patient’s usual pre-procedure dose (rather than starting with an increased
dose).[18]
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
• Low/moderate bleeding risk procedures: hold drug for approximately three DOAC half-lives prior to
procedure (adjust half-life estimate for renal function) and resume drug approximately 24 hours after
procedure and adequate achievement of post-procedural hemostasis.
• High bleeding risk procedures: hold drug for four to five DOAC half-lives prior to procedure (adjust half-
life estimate for renal function) and resume drug approximately 48 to 72 hours after procedure and
adequate achievement of post-procedural hemostasis.[18] [147]
Reversal agents
• Guidelines recommend against the use of pharmacologic anticoagulation reversal for elective surgery
or procedures. Consideration can be given to use of these agents (see Reversal agents below) for
emergency surgeries which cannot be safely postponed to allow anticoagulant effect to abate.[17] [18]

Special populations: pregnancy
Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy is associated with potential fetal and maternal harm. However,
objective evidence regarding the potential harms and the burden of using these agents in pregnancy is
limited.[164] [165]
Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are considered teratogenic. Use during pregnancy can result in fetal
bleeding, pregnancy loss, and impaired neurological development. However, if discontinued prior to the sixth
week of gestation, the risk of fetal harm is thought to be minimal.[166] [167] [168] [169] [170]
Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves represent a special challenge, as data on the efficacy of
anticoagulants other than warfarin to prevent valve thrombosis is limited. In one meta-analysis, continuing
warfarin during pregnancy resulted in fewer maternal complications, but also fewer live births, compared
to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The safety of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and lower doses
of warfarin could not be confirmed.[171] UFH and LMWH cross the placenta, but are considered safe to
use in pregnancy.[168] [172] [173] [174] [175] LMWH appears to be safer than UFH, with lower rates of
hemorrhage, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and osteopenia/osteoporosis reported.[176] [177] [178]
[179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] Guidelines and evidence-based reviews recommend LMWH as the
preferred anticoagulant in pregnancy.[31] [164] [185] [186] [187] [188]
There are reports of fondaparinux being used safely in pregnancy, despite the fact that it may cross the
placenta.[189] [190] [191] [192] [193]

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
Pregnant women were excluded from trials assessing the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants
and available evidence suggests risks for fetal abnormalities and miscarriage.[194] Therefore, these agents
are not recommended. 
Special populations: breast-feeding
The vitamin K antagonists warfarin and acenocoumarol are not detectable in breast milk.[195] [196] [197]
[198] Warfarin is, therefore, considered safe in breast-feeding. The product package insert for warfarin still
cautions use, given this data was not from a high-quality study, and recommends assessing risk/benefit and
monitoring the infant for bleeding/bruising.
Low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin are also considered safe.[164] [185] [186] [199]
Fondaparinux should be used with caution in breast-feeding as the manufacturer has reported excretion of
the drug in lactating rats, although significant absorption by the infant is thought to be unlikely.[200] [201]
Evidence supporting the safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in breast-feeding does not exist, and
the manufacturers recommend against using these medications. All DOACs are excreted in breast milk to
varying degrees.[202]
Special populations: children
Thromboembolism in pediatric patients is relatively rare compared to adults; therefore, there is limited
evidence regarding the management of anticoagulation in this patient group. As the physiology and
pharmacokinetic response to anticoagulants differs in children, it is recommended that these patients
are managed by a pediatric hematologist with expertise in anticoagulation.[203] It is likely that children
metabolize and respond to anticoagulants differently.[204] [205] There are also challenges in regards to
vascular access, suitable formulations of drugs for children, dietary differences, and adherence.
Warfarin availability in tablet form limits dependable administration to young children.[206] [207] The target
INR in children is 2.5 (range 2.0 to 3.0), except in the setting of mechanical heart valves, where adherence to
adult targets (INR target 3.0, range 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended.[33] [132] [203]
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has advantages over warfarin and unfractionated heparin
(UFH), including reduced monitoring, lack of interference with diet, reduced rate of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia, and, importantly in this patient group, a reduced risk of bone demineralization. However,
the predictability of the anticoagulant effect with weight-based dosing is less certain in children, presumably
due to unreliable plasma drug binding.[208] For this reason, it is recommended that the drug is monitored for
therapeutic effect and titrated to a target anti-Xa activity range of 0.5 to 1.0 units/mL.[203] [209]
UFH should be titrated to an active partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) representative of an anti-Xa level of
0.35 to 0.7 units/mL, or titrated according to anti-Xa levels, rather than to aPTT; many pediatric institutions
favor management by anti-Xa activity, due to less certain correlation of aPTT with heparin levels in
children.[210]
There are few studies on the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in children. One RCT compared age-
and weight-adjusted dabigatran with standard of care (LMWH, UFH, vitamin K antagonist, or fondaparinux)
for relatively short-term anticoagulation (average duration <90 days). Dabigatran was associated with
similar efficacy, rates of bleeding and adverse events.[211] Another study of rivaroxaban in children with
venous thromboembolism showed similar outcomes to standard of care, with equally low bleeding and
thrombotic outcomes, though with a reduced thrombotic burden in patients receiving rivaroxaban.[212] A trial
of apixaban in children with congenital or acquired heart disease reported reassuring rates of thrombosis
and bleeding compared with LMWH.[213] Several other trials of DOACs in children for a variety of indications
are underway, and although initial results have been encouraging, results of larger phase 3 trials will better
inform the standard of care in children.[214] [215] [216] [217]

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
CONTENTS
Special populations: older patients
Increasing age is associated with an increased risk of disease for which anticoagulation therapy is indicated,
but also with an increasing risk of bleeding from anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulants appear to be under-
utilized in patients who would benefit from antithrombotic therapy and advanced age is often cited as a
relative contraindication.
The combined benefit attributable to anticoagulation in conjunction with the rate of adverse outcomes
attributable to anticoagulation in older people has been assessed, and while the benefit of anticoagulation is
dependent on individual patient risk factors for thrombosis and risk of bleeding, benefit generally outweighs
risk.[61] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222]
Risk factors for bleeding in older people include: ground level falls; advancing age; poorly-controlled
hypertension; history of major bleeding; history of poor anticoagulation management; concomitant
antiplatelet therapy; and excessive alcohol ingestion.[58] [61] [62] [65] [66] [67] [138] [223] [224] These risk
factors have been assessed for predictive utility in assessing patients who would benefit from anticoagulation
therapy. Formalized risk assessment tools that take patient age into consideration, in conjunction with other
comorbidities that affect the risk of anticoagulation, include:[62] [67] [68]
•
• [HEMORR2HAGES Score for major bleeding risk] (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1785/hemorr2hages-
score-major-bleeding-risk)
• [ATRIA Bleeding Risk Score] (https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1718/atria-bleeding-risk-score)
As increasing age is a significant risk factor for adverse events among patients with an indication for
anticoagulation, tools for estimating the risk of outcome events of arterial and venous thrombosis among
patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) exist:[32] [33]
[34]
•
•
The risk of major bleeding in older patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for VTE or atrial
fibrillation is lower compared to vitamin K antagonists.[119] [225] [226] [227] This means that older patients
who would not have previously been considered candidates for therapy may be considered suitable for
DOAC therapy.[49] [228] It also means that the bleeding risk associated with extended treatment in these
patients may now be considered acceptable.[45] [48] [50]
Special populations: renal impairment
A dose adjustment may be required in patients with renal impairment, depending on the specific
anticoagulant used. Some agents are not recommended in patients with certain degrees of renal impairment.
For some agents, dose adjustments differ according to the indication.
• Warfarin: renal dysfunction may influence response; however, no dose adjustment is required and
dose is based on INR as usual.[110] Warfarin is not directly excreted renally; however, patients with
severe renal dysfunction have elevated risk for bleeding while on warfarin therapy.[229]
• Unfractionated heparin (UFH): may be used in renal impairment and end-stage kidney disease with
no dose adjustment required as long as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is monitored
appropriately and the dose adjusted according to the aPTT.[206] [230] [231]
• Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH): usual therapeutic doses are not recommended in patients
with significant renal impairment unless the trough anti-Xa effect is monitored before subsequent
doses.[232] [233] [234] [235] Specific dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance are
recommended and depend on which LMWH is used.[236] [237] [238]

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
• Fondaparinux: caution is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min, and
use is contraindicated if creatinine clearance is <30 mL/minute.[110] [201]
• Apixaban: for the indication of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, a dose reduction is recommended
in patients with two or more of the following factors: serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL; age ≥80 years; or
body weight ≤60 kg. No dose reduction is recommended in patients with end-stage kidney disease
who are on hemodialysis, although very few dialysis patients were included in the kinetic study on
which this statement is based. For treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), apixaban is approved
for use without dose adjustment, although serum concentrations are higher in patients with severe
renal dysfunction. Studies evaluating safety of apixaban in patients with severe renal dysfunction
suggest that it is a reasonable alternative to warfarin and may be associated with a lower risk of
bleeding.[229] [239][240] [241]
• Edoxaban: use is not recommended in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min). A
dose reduction is recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have a creatinine
clearance of 15-50 mL/minute and for patients with VTE who have a creatinine clearance of 15-50
mL/minute, a body weight ≤60 kg, or are also receiving P-glycoprotein inhibitors. As edoxaban is so
heavily dependent on renal excretion, serum levels are markedly reduced in patients with creatinine
clearance >95 mL/minute and is therefore not recommended in these patients.[14] [242] [243] [244]
• Rivaroxaban: a dose reduction is recommended in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and a
creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min. While patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of <15
mL/min were not studied in the atrial fibrillation trials, the approved prescribing information suggests
that drug exposure should be similar. Efficacy in patients on dialysis is uncertain. Rivaroxaban is not
recommended in patients with VTE and a creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min.[13] [245]
• Dabigatran: the direct oral anticoagulant that is most dependent on renal function.[246] For stroke
prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, a dose reduction is recommended in
patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-30 mL/min); there are no dose
recommendations in patients with a creatinine clearance <15 mL/min or those on dialysis. For
the treatment or prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, there are no dose
recommendations for patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min or those on dialysis. In patients
with renal impairment who are also on a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, use should either be avoided or the
dose reduced depending on the indication for treatment.[15]
Special populations: hepatic impairment
A dose adjustment may be required in patients with hepatic impairment, depending on the specific
anticoagulant used.
• Warfarin: metabolism may be affected by hepatic impairment, which may increase response to
warfarin by inhibiting clotting factor production and decreasing warfarin metabolism.[102] [110]
Patients may require a lower starting dose and slower titration of the dose.
• Unfractionated heparin: activity requires presence of antithrombin, which is produced in the liver;
however, a dose adjustment is not defined.[231]
• Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH): use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, although
no specific dose adjustments are defined.[237] [238] LMWH is suggested as the preferred agent in
patients with severe liver disease who require anticoagulant therapy.[247]
• Fondaparinux: no dose adjustment recommended for Child-Pugh class A (mild impairment) or Child-
Pugh class B (moderate impairment). There are no data for patients with severe impairment.[201]
• Apixaban: no dose adjustment recommended in Child-Pugh class A and no recommendations for
Child-Pugh class B, but there may be an increased risk of bleeding; not recommended in Child-Pugh
class C (severe impairment).[16]
• Edoxaban: no dose adjustment required in Child-Pugh class A, but not recommended in Child-Pugh
class B or C.[14]

Special populations: patients on antiplatelet
therapy
The greatest risk for bleeding is in patients who require dual antiplatelet therapy in conjunction with
anticoagulation (also known as triple antithrombotic therapy), though this strategy is increasingly rare; when
used, triple antithrombotic therapy should be continued for the shortest possible period and only in high
thrombotic risk patients.[19] The concomitant use of antiplatelet agents and oral anticoagulation occurs
primarily in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, with 30% of atrial fibrillation
patients requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).[224] [249] [250] After PCI, the duration of
dual antiplatelet therapy varies from 4 weeks to a minimum of 6-12 weeks.[19] Dual antiplatelet therapy
has been found to be superior to aspirin plus oral anticoagulation in patients undergoing PCI.[251] [252]
[253] Studies continue to focus on duration of the antiplatelet component of therapy following elective PCI,
and evidence is mounting regarding use of shorter durations of dual or triple antithrombotic therapy before
reverting to treatment with a single antiplatelet agent and an anticoagulant.[19] [254] [255] [256] Present
guidelines recommend that all patients with unstable angina or ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive
aspirin indefinitely and dual antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin plus clopidogrel) for up to 12 months.[257]
Newer data is informing the use of the safest individual agents in combination regimens.[256]
Oral anticoagulation in combination with antiplatelet therapy is associated with an annual risk of fatal
and nonfatal bleeding of 4% to 14%.[224] A small study reported a bleeding rate of 9.2% among patients
receiving triple antithrombotic therapy.[258] The risk of major bleeding with warfarin in conjunction with
antiplatelet therapy has been reported to be between 4.7% and 6.2%.[259] [260] It appears that the first
month of triple antithrombotic therapy is associated with the highest risk of bleeding occurring.[259]
There are no clear recommendations for a particular anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent in patients who
require concomitant therapy.[223] [224] [261] However, various interventions may lower the risk of bleeding
in patients who require triple antithrombotic therapy. Maintaining an INR of 2.0 to 2.5 in patients may be
associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared to a target INR of >2.6.[252] More frequent monitoring of
the INR may also be helpful. One trial suggested that apixaban combined with clopidogrel resulted in similar
efficacy but less bleeding than a regimen of either aspirin, warfarin or both.[256]
Low-dose aspirin (i.e., <100 mg/day) and clopidogrel are the preferred antiplatelet agents for patients who
require triple antithrombotic therapy. If, or when, anticoagulation plus a single antiplatelet is indicated,
clopidogrel should be considered instead of aspirin.[262] Use of clopidogrel without aspirin was associated
with a significant reduction in bleeding complications and no increase in the rate of thrombotic events.[224]
Recommendations from both the 2024 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the 2020 American
College of Cardiology (ACC) atrial fibrillation guidelines for patients undergoing PCI, with either acute
coronary syndrome or stable coronary syndromes suggest a short course of aspirin and continuation of
clopidogrel (the preferable P2Y12 inhibitor) with an oral anticoagulant for 6 to 12 months depending on risk
of stent thrombosis and bleeding. Combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies is not recommended
without a compelling indication for both classes of drugs.[19] [263] When combined, the second agent should
be continued for the shortest period needed based on the indication.
Gastroprotective therapy may be considered in patients with a history of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The
need for triple antithrombotic therapy should be frequently reassessed.
Complications: adverse effects
All anticoagulants share the principal adverse effect of bleeding, as well as other adverse effects unique to
the medication class and individual agents. Important nonbleeding related adverse effects are highlighted
below; however, the full prescribing information of an individual drug should be consulted for a complete list.

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
• Severe skin necrosis syndrome: can occur in susceptible individuals, especially those with hereditary
deficiency of protein C. Risk is increased when higher doses of warfarin are used at the initiation of
therapy.[130] The presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) increases the risk of skin
necrosis if warfarin is continued during the active phase of the disease (i.e., while thrombocytopenia is
present).[264] Also associated with a rare vascular complication called purple toe syndrome.[265]
• Osteoporosis: may be associated with osteoporosis, although the evidence for this is conflicting.[266]
Unfractionated heparin
• HIT: an immunologic complication that results in aggressive thrombosis in arteries and/or veins, which
can result in limb amputation, severe organ dysfunction, and death. Risk is dependent on the patient’s
circumstances and the dose of heparin. Risk is highest in orthopedic surgery patients and lowest in
obstetric patients.[95] It is often over-diagnosed; diagnosis should be achieved with careful adherence
to evidence-based diagnostic criteria.[177] Treatment consists of absolute avoidance of heparinoids at
any dose, and use of an alternate anticoagulant such as argatroban until the platelet count recovers.
Heparin use is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of HIT.
• Skin necrosis syndrome: very rare and may actually overlap with HIT.[265]
• Osteoporosis: prolonged use is associated with osteoporosis.[266]
• Allergic reactions: severe allergic reactions were reported following administration of heparin
contaminated with over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate.[267]
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
• HIT: can also occur with LMWH, but is less frequent compared to unfractionated heparin.[95]
Dabigatran
• Acute coronary events: has been associated with an increased risk of acute coronary events in some
studies, although others have failed to show this association.[268] [269]
• Can cause dyspepsia.
Complications: bleeding
Bleeding is usually easily detected by patients, though it can be subtle or asymptomatic. The definition
of bleeding and quantification of its severity in clinical trials varies; however, the International Society on
Thrombosis and Haemostasis has suggested the following categories:[270]
• Fatal bleeding
• Major bleeding: bleeding into a critical organ (including the: central nervous system; retina;
retroperitoneal, intra‐articular, or pericardial spaces; or intramuscular compartment with compartment
syndrome), bleeding that leads to surgery or requires other invasive therapies to control it, or overt
bleeding that results in the transfusion of at least 2 units of packed red blood cells.
• Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding: bleeding that results in evaluation or treatment by a healthcare
provider that does not meet the criteria for major bleeding.
A similar set of bleeding definitions was created for surgical patients in the postoperative period.[271]
The risk of bleeding is dependent on several factors, including characteristics of the patient, extrinsic
circumstances and the specific anticoagulant. Generally, higher doses are associated with a greater risk
of bleeding compared to lower doses, and prophylactic doses are associated with a lower risk of bleeding
compared to treatment doses.
For warfarin, higher INR values predict a higher risk of bleeding. While there is some variation between
studies, based on the indication being studied, the bleeding risk of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is
similar to, or lower than, that of warfarin. The site of bleeding also depends on the specific anticoagulant
used. DOACs are more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding compared to warfarin, although the specific

risk of individual drugs within this class may differ.[272] One study analyzed the gastrointestinal bleeding
risk of DOACs and compared differences among these drugs in age-related risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
The overall incidence of gastrointestinal bleed events was 2.74/100 patient-years with rivaroxaban versus
2.02/100 patient-years with dabigatran; 1.38/100 patient-years with apixaban versus 2.73/100 patient-years
with dabigatran; 1.34/100 patient-years with apixaban versus 3.54/100 patient-years with rivaroxaban.[273]
The study found that apixaban had the most favorable gastrointestinal safety profile and rivaroxaban the least
favorable.
DOACs are less likely to cause intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding compared to warfarin.[274] [275]
Parenteral anticoagulants have the highest risk of intramuscular or rectus sheath hematoma.[276]
Oral factor Xa inhibitors have a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when compared to low molecular
weight heparin in patients with cancer. This risk is largely confined to patients with luminal gastrointestinal
malignancies and likely varies by agent.[277]
Complications: management of bleeding
Management of bleeding during anticoagulation requires a comprehensive evaluation and various
interventions to mitigate the risk of morbidity and mortality. Elements of a comprehensive management
strategy include a number of general interventions that are applicable regardless of the agent the patient
is taking, along with agent-specific reversal strategies when indicated and available. Source control and
supportive care are the mainstay of management and should not be delayed. Use of a reversal agent does
not replace the need for these measures. Specific and nonspecific reversal agents have risks, which should
be balanced against predicted benefit before deciding to employ these.[278]
The following algorithm details the approach to managing an anticoagulated patient with acute
hemorrhage.[69] [279] [280] [281] [282]

Approach to the management of acute hemorrhage in an anticoagulated patient
Produced by SM Stevens, MD and SC Woller, MD; used with permission
General measures and blood products
• Patients who are bleeding should be assessed for the presence of hemodynamic consequences
related to bleeding, and provided with supportive care to maintain organ perfusion and oxygenation.
Supportive care includes intravenous fluids, transfusion of packed red blood cells, and in the case
of massive bleeding, replacement of lost platelets and coagulation proteins with platelet and plasma
infusions.
Source control
• In many instances, interventions directed at the source of bleeding may be used to stop or reduce
ongoing blood loss. These can include pressure on external wounds, endoscopic interventions for
gastrointestinal sources (and occasionally respiratory and genitourinary tract sources) of bleeding,
interventional radiology procedures (e.g., embolization of vessels which perfuse the bleeding location),
and surgical control of bleeding lesions.
Nonspecific prohemostatic agents
• Antifibrinolytic agents act by inhibiting the breakdown of existing fibrin thrombi, and may reduce
bleeding without specifically inhibiting the effect of anticoagulants. Tranexamic acid is the best studied
of these agents, and has been evaluated to control bleeding following trauma, as well as to treat heavy
uterine bleeding.[283]
Specific anticoagulant reversal agents may also be required.

CONTENTS
After bleeding has been controlled, the patient should be assessed and a decision made whether to resume
anticoagulation, and if so, when. There is limited evidence available to guide these decisions. Data from
registries suggest that outcomes, including stroke and mortality, are better if anticoagulation is resumed
following a major gastrointestinal hemorrhage rather than if anticoagulation is permanently stopped. The
best outcome may be obtained if anticoagulation is resumed 1-2 weeks following treatment of a bleeding
episode.[284] [285] Similar data support the re-introduction of anticoagulant therapy following an intracranial
bleed; however, this depends on the type of hemorrhage, as traumatic bleeds and deep intracerebral bleeds
due to hypertension tend to have a lower risk of re-bleeding.[286] [287] [288] Choice of anticoagulant agent,
timing of resumption, and which patients should and should not resume anticoagulation is less clear. While
precise methods of predicting the risk-benefit balance of reinstituting anticoagulants is unavailable, the
American Heart Association and American Stroke Association suggest considering the following factors to
help inform decision-making: 
• lobar location of the initial intracranial hemorrhage
• older age
• presence, number, and lobar location of microbleeds on MRI
• presence of disseminated cortical superficial siderosis on MRI
• poorly controlled hypertension
• Asian or Black race; and
• presence of apolipoprotein ApoE-2 or ApoE-4 alleles.[282]
The decision to resume anticoagulation should be made in conjunction with specialists involved in managing
the bleeding complication, and the patient’s values and preferences should be taken into account.
Reversal agents: general principles
Reversing the effect of an anticoagulant is often part of the management strategy for bleeding; however, the
use of reversal agents should always be complementary to other measures (e.g., stopping anticoagulant,
source control, blood products). Restoring the coagulation capacity of the blood does not repair injuries
or lesions that are actively bleeding, improve hemodynamic compromise, or restore lost blood. Therefore,
appropriate supportive care and source control of the bleeding are the top priorities. Reversing the effect of
an anticoagulant may also be required for other reasons, including the need for urgent or emergency invasive
procedures, the use of thrombolytic agents for acute stroke or acute coronary syndrome, or to counteract the
effects of a supratherapeutic level of anticoagulant. All reversal agents have risks, which should be balanced
against predicted benefit before deciding to employ these.
The choice of reversal agent depends on the specific anticoagulant used. Dosing also depends on the
specific anticoagulant used, as well as the dose and time since the agent was last administered. Each
reversal agent has unique risks and adverse effects; however, all agents share a common risk of possible
thrombosis. Reversal agents should, therefore, only be used when the benefits outweigh the risks.
No reversal agents exist for argatroban, bivalirudin, or desirudin. However, due to their short half-lives,
discontinuing these agents results in rapid elimination of their anticoagulant effect.
Reversal agents: for heparins
Protamine sulfate is the agent of choice to reverse the effect of unfractionated heparin and low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH). This drug binds to heparin to form a stable salt, which results in rapid reversal
of the anticoagulant effect of heparin.[80] Protamine sulfate is given intravenously, and the dose is based
on the number of units of heparin that the patient has received and the timing of dosing. The dose is less
certain if unfractionated heparin was administered subcutaneously, and an infusion may be required. For
intravenous unfractionated heparin, the effect of reversal can be assessed by measuring the activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT). Protamine sulfate is thought to partially neutralize the effect of LMWH, but there
is little clinical evidence to demonstrate that reversal has a beneficial impact on bleeding. Dosing is based on
the dose of LMWH and when the last dose was received, taking into consideration renal dysfunction, which
may prolong activity of LMWH. The most serious adverse effect is anaphylaxis, and a known allergy to fish
(from which protamine is derived) may predict this risk.[289]

Recombinant coagulation factor Xa (andexanet alfa) may also reverse the effect of heparins, though it is not
approved for this indication and dosing strategy is unknown.[290]
Reversal agents: for warfarin
Vitamin K (phytonadione) reverses the effect of warfarin by interfering with its mechanism of action, restoring
the effective synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Its effect is not immediate
as it requires synthesis of new coagulant proteins. Vitamin K has a faster onset of action when given by
intravenous infusion, with its effect starting approximately 2 hours after administration and the full effect of
its dose achieved within 24 hours.[130] Oral administration has similar efficacy to intravenous administration,
but the full effect of the dose is not achieved until approximately 36 hours after administration, and a higher
dose is needed to achieve the same effect as an intravenous dose.[130] Dose depends on the pre-dose INR,
whether complete or partial reversal is required, and the indication for reversal. In life-threatening bleeding,
full reversal is usually required and a high dose should be given.[291] If intravenous dosing is chosen for
cases of less serious bleeding episodes, and subsequent resumption of anticoagulation with warfarin is
anticipated, smaller doses should be used.[292] [293] Low doses of oral vitamin K are used in patients
with supratherapeutic INR values when the goal is to restore the INR to the target range.[107] For patients
with INRs of >4.5 but <10 and without clinically relevant bleeding, a systematic review found no evidence
for benefits with use of vitamin K and the American Society of Hematology guidelines suggest temporary
cessation of warfarin alone without the addition of vitamin K.[139] [294]
Anaphylaxis with intravenous infusions is uncommon but can be mitigated by giving the infusion slowly in a
dilute solution.[130] Vitamin K does not appear to increase the risk of thrombosis; therefore, the risk is due to
removing the protective effect of the anticoagulant. 
In patients who are bleeding or those who require very rapid reversal, either fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or
prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are preferred to vitamin K; PCCs are preferred over FFP in most
situations in life-threatening or major bleeding.[130] [292] However, as these agents tend to have shorter
serum half-lives compared to warfarin, they are usually combined with vitamin K to prevent the recurrence of
the anticoagulant effect of warfarin that has not yet been eliminated.[291] [293]
FFP restores coagulation by replacing coagulation factors. While it has been the agent used principally
for emergency reversal in the US, it has several shortcomings.[295] [296] As it must be thawed and
cross-matched to the recipient, it takes significant time to administer. Additionally, a very large volume
of plasma is required to substantially reduce the INR, and the volume needed may preclude practical
use.[292] Even at very high volumes, it is unlikely to have further effect on the INR once the INR reaches
approximately 1.5.[297] The dose depends on the pre-dose INR. Dose calculators are available but are
relatively complex.[292] [298] FFP can cause transfusion reactions, including life-threatening reactions, in the
presence of an incorrect cross-match or unusual antibodies, and infections transmitted from plasma donors
or contamination. Higher volumes of infused plasma may result in transfusion-related circulatory overload
and transfusion-associated acute lung injury. Thrombosis may also occur.
Guidelines have suggested use of PCCs in preference to FFP, and the use of FFP appears to be
decreasing.[130] [282] [295] PCCs are coagulation factor products which are prepared from pooled plasma
and replace the dysfunctional coagulation proteins that result from warfarin therapy. PCCs come in several
forms, including 3-factor preparations (which contain factors II, IX, and X) and 4-factor preparations (which
also contain factor VII).[299] Standard PCCs contain the proteins in their inactivated state. Activated
PCCs contain activated, rather than inactivated, factor VII. Due to their powdered formulation and lack
of need for cross-matching, PCCs can be given much more rapidly than FFP, carry little, if any, risk of
transfusion reactions, and are infused in small volumes. These agents were developed to address bleeding
complications in patients with hemophilia, and use for reversal of warfarin was originally not approved. An
inactivated 4-factor PCC (4F-PCC) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically
to reverse the effect of warfarin. PCCs are favored over FFP for warfarin reversal in patients with serious
or life-threatening bleeding in evidence-based guidelines.[130] One systematic review found that the use
of 4F-PCC for warfarin reversal is superior to FFP in normalizing the INR, with no difference in the rate of
thrombosis.[300] The main risk associated with PCCs is arterial or venous thrombosis. In one study, the rate
of thrombosis was reported to be 3.9%.[301] 4F-PCC should be avoided in patients with a history of heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia, as it contains heparin.

CONTENTS
Recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) is a concentrate of factor VII in its activated form that has been
approved by the FDA to address serious and life-threatening bleeding in patients with hemophilia. Warfarin
reversal is among a number of off-label uses for which rVIIa has been administered. One systematic review
and meta-analysis did not show a survival benefit for use of rVIIa for off-label indications, but did detect a
risk of thromboembolism following administration.[302] Use of rVIIa has been suggested for life-threatening
bleeding in one major guideline, but analysis of use according to available treatment guidelines did not lead
to improved mortality in a registry.[130] [303]
Reversal agents: for direct oral anticoagulants
(DOACs)
When introduced, DOACs lacked any proven reversal agent. Activated, inactivated, 3-factor, and 4-factor
prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs), as well as recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) have all
been studied as possible reversal agents for dabigatran, but most studies have been performed using in vitro
specimens, and the few in vivo studies available have been confined to nonbleeding, healthy volunteers.
Study endpoints have been limited to assessment of various coagulation parameters. A meta-analysis of
nonspecific reversal agents for DOACs indicated that trial results have been limited to laboratory parameters,
and have not been consistent.[300]
The role of PCCs in patients receiving dabigatran has been displaced by the approval of idarucizumab, a
specific reversal agent for dabigatran. Idarucizumab is a full humanized antibody fragment (Fab) directed
against dabigatran which nullifies its anticoagulant effect. It is administered by intravenous infusion. In an
open-label trial, 503 patients taking dabigatran who experienced either acute bleeding or required urgent
surgery received idarucizumab. The median time to cessation of bleeding was 2.5 hours, and operative
hemostasis was assessed as normal in 93.4% of surgeries. Approximately 7% of patients sustained a
new thrombosis within 90 days.[304] Immunogenicity to the Fab fragment may also develop; however, the
implications of this are not yet clear. Investigational agents are also in development. In addition to reversal
agents, recent ingestion of dabigatran may be mitigated by administration of charcoal. Hemodialysis is also
an option for removal of dabigatran.[305]
Recombinant coagulation factor Xa (andexanet alfa) is a bioengineered analog of factor Xa, which acts
as a decoy target for factor Xa inhibitors and has no direct effect on the coagulation cascade. It has been
approved by the FDA for patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation
is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. According to its mechanism of action, it would be
predicted to reverse the effects of other medications that affect factor Xa (edoxaban, fondaparinux, LMWH)
but it is not approved for use to reverse the effect of these drugs, and dosing is unclear. Recombinant
coagulation factor Xa (andexanet alfa) received approval through an accelerated approval process, based on
limited data.[306] Additional studies have since been published.[307] [308] The ANNEXA-I study, evaluating
andexanet alfa compared to usual care in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, compared patients with
intracranial hemorrhage who had received apixaban within 15 hours of diagnosis of the bleeding episode.
A total of 263 patients received recombinant coagulation factor Xa (andexanet alfa) vs. 267 randomized
to usual care (which could include nonspecific prohemostatic agents, usually PCC). Use of recombinant
coagulation factor Xa (andexanet alfa) was associated with less hematoma expansion but at the cost of
nearly double the rate of thrombotic events.[309]
A small number of in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed with PCCs and rVIIa; however, results
have been conflicting. No prospective comparative trials exist for recombinant coagulation factor Xa
(andexanet alfa) and 4F-PCCs, the two reversal agents most likely to produce effective hemostasis.
Therefore, the decision to use one over the other must carefully weigh the benefits of reversal against the risk
of thrombosis. Previous guidelines and guidance statements have supported this choice.[87] [310] Though
newer guidelines give preference to recombinant coagulation factor Xa (andexanet alfa), if it is available.[282]
For the currently available DOACs, society guidance statements have recommended situations in which a
specific antidote should be used, considered, or avoided.[18] [311] [312]

• Cautions: increased risk of thromboembolic events with premature cessation; risk of spinal or epidural
hematoma with spinal or epidural anesthesia; hepatic and renal impairment.
• Drug interactions: P-glycoprotein inhibitors and inducers; other drugs that can cause bleeding (e.g.,
antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
• Adverse effects: bleeding is the most common adverse effect (see below).
In the RELY trial, atrial fibrillation patients were treated with dabigatran (110 mg twice daily or 150 mg
twice daily) or dose-adjusted warfarin. There were significantly fewer major bleeds with the lower dose of
dabigatran compared to warfarin, but no significant difference in bleeding with the higher dose. The higher
dose of dabigatran resulted in more gastrointestinal bleeds than warfarin. Both doses of dabigatran resulted
in fewer intracranial bleeds.[46]
In the RE-COVER and RE-COVER II trials, patients were randomized to receive dabigatran after treatment
with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5 to 10 days, or a parenteral anticoagulant transitioned to warfarin. In the
pooled analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in major bleeding or recurrent VTE.[39]
The RE-SONATE and RE-MEDY trial program evaluated the use of dabigatran compared to warfarin for
extended VTE prophylaxis in patients who had already completed 3 to 18 months of prior anticoagulation.
There was no statistically significant difference in major bleeding events in the warfarin or dabigatran arms,
but dabigatran resulted in fewer clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds.[48]
Dabigatran was compared to enoxaparin in three trials investigating elective joint replacement. A meta-
analysis of these trials showed noninferiority of dabigatran compared to enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE
after joint replacement surgery, with a similar risk of bleeding.[314] [315] [316] [317]
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Anticoagulants: oral factor Xa inhibitors
• Pharmacology: selectively inhibit factor Xa, including free and clot-bound factor Xa, and thus indirectly
decrease thrombin formation and subsequent fibrin clot formation. This drug class includes apixaban,
edoxaban, and rivaroxaban.[13] [14] [16] [318]
• Indications: prevention of thromboembolic events in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (apixaban,
rivaroxaban, and edoxaban); treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) (apixaban,
rivaroxaban, and edoxaban); prevention of VTE following hip or knee surgery (apixaban and
rivaroxaban); secondary prevention of recurrent VTE (apixaban and rivaroxaban); VTE prophylaxis in
acutely ill hospitalized adults who are at risk due to immobility or other risk factors for VTE, including,
possibly, the post-discharge period, which may be up to 39 days in patients at high risk of VTE
and low risk of bleeding (rivaroxaban); stable coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease
(rivaroxaban). 
• Contraindications: active bleeding.
• Cautions: increased risk of thromboembolic events with premature cessation without transitioning to
an alternative anticoagulant; risk of spinal or epidural hematoma with spinal or epidural anesthesia;
hepatic and renal impairment (dose may need to be reduced or drug avoided depending on drug);
mechanical heart valves; moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis (edoxaban); nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
with creatinine clearance >95 mL/min (these patients have an increased risk of stroke with edoxaban
compared with similar patients treated with warfarin).[87]
• Drug interactions: strong inhibitors or inducers of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 (apixaban and
rivaroxaban); strong P-glycoprotein inducers and inhibitors (edoxaban); other drugs that can cause
bleeding (e.g., antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
• Adverse effects: bleeding is the most common adverse effect (see below).
In the ARISTOTLE trial, which compared warfarin to apixaban in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,
apixaban was significantly less likely to cause major bleeding.[42] In the AVERROES trial, which compared
aspirin to apixaban in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, there was no significant difference in the

risk of bleeding.[49] The AMPLIFY trial compared apixaban to warfarin/enoxaparin for the acute treatment of
VTE. The relative risk of major bleeding was 0.31, favoring apixaban.[47] The AMPLIFY-EXT trial evaluated
apixaban compared to placebo for extended secondary prevention of VTE (patients had completed 6 to 12
months of therapy with either apixaban or enoxaparin/warfarin in the AMPLIFY trial). The composite of major
and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 27 patients (3.2%) versus 35 patients (4.3%) versus
22 patients (2.7%) in the apixaban (5 mg/day), apixaban (10 mg/day), and placebo groups, respectively.[50]
The ADVANCE trial series looked at varying doses of enoxaparin compared to apixaban for the prevention
of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following hip or knee surgery. Apixaban did
not differ from enoxaparin (40 mg/day) for bleeding outcomes, but was less likely to result in the composite
endpoint of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding than enoxaparin (60 mg/day).[319] [320]
[321]
The ROCKET AF study enrolled patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and randomized them to receive
either warfarin or rivaroxaban. There was no significant difference in major bleeding between groups. There
were significantly fewer (i.e., 0.8% versus 1.2%) intracranial hemorrhages in the rivaroxaban arm.[40]
Rivaroxaban increased gastrointestinal bleeding when compared to warfarin.[322]
In the EINSTEIN DVT study, subjects with acute DVT received either warfarin/enoxaparin or rivaroxaban.
There was no significant difference in major bleeding between the groups.[45] For PE, the EINSTEIN
PE study was conducted identically. There were 26 major bleeding events (1.1%) in the rivaroxaban arm
compared to 52 events (2.2%) in the warfarin/enoxaparin arm. Gastrointestinal bleeding rates were not
reported.[44] The RECORD series studied rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in patients
with hip or knee arthroplasty. There was no statistical difference in major bleeding between groups.[323]
[324] [325]
In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, where nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients received either warfarin or
edoxaban, major bleeding was less frequent with edoxaban (3.1% versus 3.7%). The most common site of
major bleeding was the gastrointestinal tract (including lower, upper, and rectal bleeding). Gastrointestinal
bleeding occurred in 205 patients (1.78%) on edoxaban compared to 150 patients (1.27%) on warfarin.[43]
In the Hokusai VTE study, major bleeding did not differ between edoxaban and standard anticoagulation,
but edoxaban was superior for the composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (8.5% versus
10.3%). Edoxaban was associated with a higher rate of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to warfarin (4.2%
versus 3.6%).[41]

• Contraindications: severe thrombocytopenia (including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia); when
appropriate monitoring cannot be performed (treatment doses); active bleeding (unless bleed is due to
disseminated intravascular coagulation).
• Cautions: hepatic and renal impairment (no dose adjustment required, but these conditions may
increase risk of bleeding).
• Drug interactions: antiplatelet agents increase risk of bleeding.
• Adverse effects: bleeding; thrombocytopenia; abnormal liver function tests; hypersensitivity; local
reactions.

Anticoagulation management principles Contents
CONTENTS
• Monitoring: platelets; activated partial thromboplastin time.
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Anticoagulants: low molecular weight heparins
(LMWHs)
• Pharmacology: indirectly inhibit factors Xa and IIa by binding to antithrombin; inhibit higher proportion
of factor Xa than factor IIa compared to heparin. This drug class includes enoxaparin, dalteparin, and
tinzaparin. Tinzaparin is not available in the US.[95] [237] [238] [326] [327] [328]
• Indications: prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical inpatients (e.g., abdominal,
hip, knee surgery) and at-risk hospitalized patients; prophylaxis of ischemic events in unstable
angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction; treatment of acute VTE (enoxaparin); acute treatment
of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (enoxaparin); extended treatment of VTE in cancer patients
(dalteparin).
• Contraindications: active bleeding; thrombocytopenia with a positive test for antiplatelet antibody;
history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; hypersensitivity to heparin or pork products.
• Cautions: recent hemorrhage; diabetic retinopathy; recent gastrointestinal bleed; uncontrolled
hypertension; predisposition to bleeding; risk of spinal or epidural hematoma with spinal or epidural
anesthesia; pregnant women with mechanical heart valves; renal impairment (dose adjustment
required); hepatic impairment (use with caution).
• Drug interactions: antiplatelet agents increase risk of bleeding.
• Adverse effects: bleeding; thrombocytopenia (less likely to cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
compared to unfractionated heparin); anemia; abnormal liver function tests; diarrhea; nausea.
• Monitoring: anti-Xa activity is rarely required; platelets.
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Anticoagulants: parenteral factor Xa inhibitors
• Pharmacology: inhibit factor Xa indirectly by binding to antithrombin; no effect on factor IIa or platelet
function. Fondaparinux is currently the only drug available in this class.[201]
• Indications: prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hip, knee, or abdominal surgery;
treatment of acute VTE.
• Contraindications: creatinine clearance <30 mL/min; active bleeding; acute bacterial endocarditis;
positive test for antiplatelet antibody in presence of fondaparinux; body weight <50 kg (VTE
prevention).
• Cautions: older people (increased risk of hemorrhage); creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min; should not
be used as sole anticoagulant during percutaneous coronary intervention (risk of catheter thrombosis).
• Drug interactions: no known significant interactions; drugs that increase risk of hemorrhage should be
discontinued prior to use.
• Adverse effects: bleeding is the most common adverse effect (see below).
• Monitoring: platelets.
Fondaparinux has been compared to enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery in various
trials. In addition to elective joint replacement, fondaparinux was also compared to enoxaparin in one
randomized controlled trial in patients with hip fracture, and was found to reduce the risk of VTE without an
increase in major bleeding.[329] One study in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty found that fondaparinux
was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of bleeding compared to enoxaparin (2.1%
versus 0.2%); however, the risk was found to be similar in other trials.[330] The risk of major bleeding was

also assessed in abdominal surgery trials. In one study, major bleeding was more likely in patients treated
with fondaparinux (3.4%) compared to patients treated with dalteparin (2.4%).[331] No difference in bleeding
risk was found between fondaparinux and either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin in patients treated for
acute VTE.[332] [333]
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Anticoagulants: heparinoids
• Pharmacology: low molecular weight heparinoids that catalyze inactivation of factor Xa and also
indirectly enhance inactivation of factor IIa; lower cross-reactivity with heparin-associated antibodies
in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) compared to low molecular weight heparin.
Danaparoid is currently the only drug available in this class, although it is not available in the US.[236]
[334]
• Indications: HIT; deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (prior history of HIT); DVT prophylaxis
following orthopedic or major abdominal or thoracic surgery; nonhemorrhagic stroke.
• Contraindications: bacterial endocarditis; history of major blood clotting disorder; active bleeding;
severe untreated hypertension; history of thrombocytopenia with prior use; brain, spine, eye, or ear
surgery.
• Cautions: gastrointestinal ulcers; renal impairment.
• Drug interactions: no known significant interactions; drugs that increase risk of hemorrhage should be
discontinued prior to use.
• Adverse effects: bleeding is the most common adverse effect (see below); injection site hematoma
(5%).
Danaparoid was compared to warfarin for DVT prophylaxis in patients following hip fracture surgery. DVT
was found in 7% of patients who were treated with danaparoid and in 21% of patients treated with warfarin.
Major bleeding complications did not differ between the two groups.[335]
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Anticoagulants: hirudins
• Pharmacology: bivalent, direct thrombin inhibitors that reversibly and directly bind to both the active
enzyme site and the fibrin binding site (unlike argatroban and dabigatran that bind solely to active
enzyme site); inhibit both free and clot-bound thrombin. This drug class includes bivalirudin and
desirudin.[93] [336] [337]
• Indications: patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(bivalirudin); patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with concomitant use
of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (bivalirudin); patients undergoing PCI with, or at risk for, heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia (bivalirudin); prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hip surgery
(desirudin).
• Contraindications: active major bleeding.
• Cautions: increased risk of acute stent thrombosis in patients undergoing PCI after ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (compared to heparin); renal impairment (dose reduction).
• Drug interactions: warfarin (prolongs INR); increased risk of bleeding when given with other
anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents.
• Adverse effects: bleeding (see below); anaphylaxis (some patients develop antibodies and experience
anaphylaxis on re-exposure, although this is rare).
In the REPLACE-2 trial, major bleeding occurred less often when bivalirudin was combined with a
glycoprotein IIa/IIIb rather than heparin (2.4% versus 4.1%) in patients with acute coronary syndrome

undergoing PCI.[338] A similar finding was noted in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty for unstable or
postinfarction angina.[339] In patients undergoing VTE prophylaxis following total hip replacement, there was
no difference in bleeding risk between desirudin and enoxaparin.[340]
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Anticoagulants: argatroban
• Pharmacology: direct thrombin inhibitor which unlike heparin, low molecular weight heparin,
fondaparinux, and danaparoid does not require antithrombin for its activity.[92]
• Indications: prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT); patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with, or at risk for
HIT.
• Contraindications: active, clinically significant bleeding.
• Cautions: severe uncontrolled hypertension; spinal anesthesia; lumbar puncture; major surgery;
gastrointestinal lesions; congenital bleeding disorders; hepatic impairment.
• Drug interactions: heparin (should be stopped before argatroban started); warfarin (prolonged
prothrombin time/INR); increased risk of bleeding when given with other anticoagulants, thrombolytics,
and antiplatelet agents.
• Adverse effects: bleeding (see below).
In clinical trials of patients with HIT with or without thrombosis, argatroban was compared to local treatment
protocols (usually a vitamin K antagonist-based regimen). Rates of major bleeding were 3.1% for argatroban
and 8.2% for control in HIT patients without thrombosis, and 11.1% for argatroban and 2.2% for control in
HIT patients with thrombosis.[341] In a study of patients with coronary heart disease who were undergoing
elective percutaneous coronary intervention, there was no statistical difference in bleeding between patients
treated with argatroban or heparin.[342]
Consult local drug formulary for full prescribing information and dose.
Patient information
For all anticoagulants, patients should be educated to monitor themselves for signs and symptoms of
bleeding, as well as for signs and symptoms of new thrombosis. Patients should also be educated about
when to seek medical attention, such as for significant head or abdominal trauma, uncontrolled bleeding from
an injury, unremitting epistaxis, hemoptysis, hematochezia, hematuria, severe and unusual headaches, or
changes in mental status.
Patients should also be instructed to notify their anticoagulation provider of any planned surgeries
or procedures, with sufficient advance notice, to allow guidance on periprocedural anticoagulation
management. Patients should be counseled not to start new prescription or over-the-counter medications,
herbal medicines, or supplements without consulting their anticoagulant provider. They should also notify all
providers that they are on an anticoagulant, particularly with warfarin, so this can be taken into consideration
when prescribing other medications.
If patients are selected to perform self-monitoring, they should receive comprehensive training on the use
of the home monitor and be able to demonstrate proper technique in performing the INR measurement. In
addition to these skills, patients who will perform self-management should receive formalized training on the
principles of warfarin dose adjustment; they should also receive a protocol detailing situations in which direct
communication to the responsible healthcare provider is required, and be able to demonstrate these skills on
a formalized assessment. A significant proportion of patients may not be able to acquire the skills necessary
for self-management.[343]
There are no foods that have so far been identified to interact with direct oral anticoagulants; however,
rivaroxaban should be taken with a meal to facilitate adequate absorption. For warfarin, a patient’s INR

level can be affected by changes in vitamin K intake, overall caloric intake, and ingestion of other fat-
soluble vitamins.[344] Decreased vitamin K intake can increase INR, while increased vitamin K intake can
decrease INR. Warfarin patients should not be counseled to avoid vitamin K-containing foods but to maintain
a consistent diet. Alcohol can increase INR for patients on warfarin, and can increase the bleeding risk for all
anticoagulants. Patients should be educated to abstain from alcohol or limit alcohol intake to no more than
1-2 drinks on an occasional basis.[345]
Educating patients regarding the importance of venous thromboembolism prevention while hospitalized
results in fewer refused doses of prophylactic anticoagulants.[346]

Figure 4: Risk stratification for procedural bleed risk (* No residual anticoagulant effect at the time of
procedure [i.e., four to five drug half-life interruptions pre-procedure]; † Includes spinal and epidural
anesthesia or any other neuraxial [e.g., pain management] intervention; consider not only absolute risk for
major bleeding but potentially devastating consequences of epidural bleeding and associated lower limb
paralysis; ‡ Some residual anticoagulant effect allowed [i.e., two to three drug half-life interruptions pre-
procedure]; § Radial approach may be considered minimal bleed risk compared with femoral approach; ¶

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
