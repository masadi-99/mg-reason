Hypercholesterolemia Overview
Summary
Hypercholesterolemia is most commonly, but not exclusively, defined as elevated levels of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C); an alternative
term is dyslipidemia, which encompasses elevated triglycerides, low levels of HDL-C, and qualitative lipid
abnormalities.
Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including
cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and peripheral arterial disease; it is usually
symptomatically quiescent until significant atherosclerosis has developed.
Complications of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis include myocardial infarction, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac death, ischemic stroke, erectile dysfunction, claudication, and acute limb
ischemia.
Risk factors for secondary hypercholesterolemia include a sedentary lifestyle and a diet characterized by
the excessive consumption of saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, and cholesterol. Other associations include
diabetes, excess body weight mainly in the abdominal region, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and
cholestatic liver disease. Low HDL-C levels are associated with smoking and abdominal obesity.
Hypercholesterolemia is diagnosed by a lipid profile, consisting of measurements of total cholesterol, LDL-
C (estimated or direct), HDL-C, and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C is calculated by the subtraction of HDL-C from
total cholesterol.
Hypercholesterolemia is treated with lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes, exercise, and smoking
cessation, as well as pharmacologic intervention with statin therapy and selective use of other lipid-lowering
drugs.
Definition
Hypercholesterolemia, an elevation of total cholesterol (TC) and/or LDL-C or non-HDL-C (defined as the
subtraction of HDL-C from TC) in the blood, is also often referred to as dyslipidemia, to encompass the
fact that it might be accompanied by a decrease in HDL-C, an increase in triglycerides, or qualitative lipid
abnormalities. Dyslipidemia is classified as serum TC, LDL-C, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, or lipoprotein(a)
concentrations above the 90th percentile, or HDL-C or apolipoprotein A-I concentrations below the 10th
percentile for the general population. However, these classic percentile cut-off points should not be used
too rigidly in defining dyslipidemia. For example, evidence suggests that lipoprotein(a) ≥80th percentile is
abnormal and linked to elevated cardiovascular risk.[1]

Hypercholesterolemia Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The prevalence of the disorder varies depending on the definition of dyslipidemia and the population studied.
Approximately 24.7 million adults or 10% of the adult population in the US have total cholesterol levels ≥240
mg/dL.[3] One study evaluating how lipid concentrations changed among US adults from 2007 to 2018 found
improvement with mean age-adjusted total cholesterol concentrations declining from 197 mg/dL to 189 mg/
dL across all racial and ethnic subgroups, with the exception of non-Hispanic Asian adults.[4] In patients
with coronary heart disease (CHD), the prevalence of dyslipidemia is as high as 80% to 88%, compared with
approximately 40% to 48% in age-matched controls without coronary disease.[5] The INTERHEART study
on risk factors associated with myocardial infarction found that hyperlipidemia (defined as elevated levels of
apoB/apoA1 ratio) had a population attributable risk of 49%.[6] 
There is a strong correlation between body mass index and incidence of hypercholesterolemia.[7] 
A worrisome development is the increase in the rate of risk factors for CHD (including hypercholesterolemia)
in low-income countries, while risk factors for CHD have decreased in prevalence in high-income
countries.[8] [9] While previously there had been a steady decline in mortality from heart disease in the US
since the early 1960s, such declines slowed and in fact reversed from 2010 onward. This highlights the
tremendous importance of the ongoing management and evaluation of cardiovascular disease.[10] [11] One
study evaluating the prevalence of statin use for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease in the US found that black and Hispanic participants had significantly lower statin use than white
participants.[12] 
Etiology
The etiology of hypercholesterolemia can be classified into primary and secondary causes.
Primary causes are due to single or multiple gene mutations resulting in a disturbance of low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) and/or triglyceride production or clearance. These vary in location of genetic defect,
inheritance pattern, prevalence, clinical features, and treatment. At least 18 separate entities have been
described.[13] The suspicion for a primary lipid disorder should be especially high in patients with premature
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a family history of early ASCVD, a significantly elevated
serum cholesterol level (>240 mg/dL), or physical signs of hyperlipidemia. Primary dyslipidemias are
most commonly seen in children and young adults and cause a small percentage of cases in adults. LDL-
cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL in adults, and ≥160 mg/dL in children and adolescents, may indicate the
presence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In that circumstance, first-degree family members must
also be checked for dyslipidemia, as FH is an autosomal co-dominant disease (meaning that inheriting just
one affected allele can cause hyperlipidemia). If other cases are found, relatives must also be checked for
elevated LDL-C (cascade screening). FH is usually characterized by a family history of both early coronary
heart disease and physical exam findings such as xanthomas within affected family members.
Most adult cases of dyslipidemia are due to a combination of the effects of polygenes and unhealthy
lifestyle. In many Western countries, sedentary lifestyle and excessive consumption of saturated fats
and trans-fatty acids are the most important secondary causes.[14] Certain medical conditions are
commonly associated with dyslipidemia, including chronic renal insufficiency, abdominal obesity, diabetes
mellitus, hypothyroidism, cholestatic liver disease, and alcohol dependency. Certain drugs, including high-
dose thiazide diuretics, oral estrogens, glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, anti-HIV agents, and atypical
antipsychotics such as olanzapine and clozapine have also been implicated in causing mild-to-moderate

Hypercholesterolemia Theory
degrees of dyslipidemia.[15] Use of atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and clozapine, and of beta-
blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic or alpha-blocking activities are associated with reduced high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Notably, the role HDL-C plays in dyslipidemia remains debatable, with
very high levels of HDL-C conversely being associated with increased mortality in individuals with coronary
artery disease.[16]
Pathophysiology
Hypercholesterolemia develops as a consequence of abnormal lipoprotein metabolism, mainly reductions
in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression or activity, and consequently diminishing hepatic LDL
clearance from the plasma. This is a major predisposing risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis.
This mechanism is classically seen in familial hypercholesterolemia and when excess saturated or trans fat
is ingested. In addition, excessive production of very low-density lipoprotein by the liver, as seen in familial
combined hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance states such as abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes, can
also induce hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.
A current theory for the initiating event in atherogenesis is that apolipoprotein B-100-containing lipoproteins
are retained in the subendothelial space, by means of a charge-mediated interaction with extracellular
matrix and proteoglycans.[17] This allows reactive oxygen species to modify the surface phospholipids and
unesterified cholesterol of primarily LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), but also other lipoproteins. Circulating LDL-
C can also be taken up into macrophages through unregulated scavenger receptors. As a result of LDL-C
oxidation, isoprostanes are formed. Isoprostanes are chemically stable, free radical-catalyzed products of
arachidonic acid, and are structural isomers of conventional prostaglandins. Isoprostane levels are increased
in atherosclerotic lesions, but they may also be found as F2 isoprostanes in the urine of asymptomatic
patients with hypercholesterolemia.[18]
A strong association exists between elevated plasma concentrations of oxidized LDL-C and coronary heart
disease.[19] The mechanisms through which oxidized LDL-C promotes atherosclerosis are multiple and
include damage to the endothelium, induction of growth factors, inflammatory pathway stimulation, and
recruitment of macrophages and monocytes.
Vasoconstriction in the setting of high levels of oxidized LDL-C seems to be related to a reduced release of
the vasodilator nitric oxide from the damaged endothelial wall, as well as increased platelet aggregation and
thromboxane release.
Smooth muscle proliferation has also been linked to the release of cytokines from activated platelets.[20]
The state of hypercholesterolemia leads invariably to an excess accumulation of oxidized LDL-C within the
macrophages, thereby transforming them into "foam" cells. The rupture of these cells can lead to further
damage of the vessel wall due to the release of oxygen free radicals, oxidized LDL-C, and intracellular
enzymes.
Classification
World Health Organization/Fredrickson classification[2]
Classically, dyslipidemia can be classified phenotypically by lipid electrophoresis based on which lipoprotein
is raised.

Hypercholesterolemia Theory
THEORY
Type:
• I - elevated chylomicrons; associated with lipoprotein lipase deficiency, apolipoprotein C-II deficiency
• IIa - elevated LDL; associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, polygenic hypercholesterolemia,
nephrosis, hypothyroidism, familial combined hyperlipidemia
• IIb - elevated LDL and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL); associated with familial combined
hyperlipidemia
• III - elevated intermediate-density lipoprotein; associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia
• IV - elevated VLDL; associated with familial hypertriglyceridemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia,
sporadic hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal obesity, diabetes
• V - elevated chylomicrons and VLDL; associated with diabetes.
Clinical classification
In a more simple and practical way, dyslipidemia can also be classified as:
• Isolated hypercholesterolemia: mostly due to LDL-C elevation
• Mixed or combined dyslipidemia: elevations in total or LDL-C, and in triglycerides
• Isolated hypertriglyceridemia: elevation in triglycerides only
• Low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C): either isolated or in association with hypercholesterolemia or
hypertriglyceridemia. Causes of low HDL-C include abdominal obesity with insulin resistance,
hypertriglyceridemia, smoking, and genetic diseases such as apoA-I, ABCA1 (adenosine triphosphate-
binding cassette transporter), or lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency.
Case history
Case history #1
A 43-year-old pilot presents for a cardiac stress test required by his employer. He states that there is
a strong history of premature cardiac disease in his family and two of his older brothers are currently
being treated for high cholesterol. System review is negative except for some mild exertional shortness of
breath. Physical examination demonstrates moderate abdominal obesity with a body mass index of 31 kg/
m² and waist circumference of 40 inches (102 cm). The remainder of the exam is normal.
Other presentations
Many patients present with symptomatic cardiovascular disease, such as angina, myocardial infarction,
transient ischemic attacks, or stroke, and claudication. Patients with very high levels of low-density
lipoprotein may present with eyelid xanthelasmas; arcus cornealis with onset before the age of
45 years; and tendinous xanthomas in the Achilles, elbow, and knee tendons as well as over the
metacarpophalangeal joints (familial hypercholesterolemia).

Hypercholesterolemia Diagnosis
Approach
Patients with hypercholesterolemia may be incidentally diagnosed on routine blood testing and have no
presenting clinical features.
History
In most cases the clinician is presented with the consequences of long-standing dyslipidemia. It is
therefore wise to carry out a systematic review for vascular disease, focusing on symptoms of coronary
artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, such as chest pain, shortness
of breath, weakness, dysphasia, or claudication. It is also helpful to take a detailed family history for early
onset of coronary heart disease and dyslipidemia in first-degree relatives, and ask the patient about their
level of exercise and diet at this stage.
Physical examination
The patient can be examined for direct signs of hypercholesterolemia, such as eyelid xanthelasmas, arcus
cornealis (with onset before the age of 45 years), and xanthomata. Tendinous xanthomas at the Achilles,
elbow and knee tendons, and over metacarpophalangeal joints are characteristics of heterozygous and
homozygous forms of familial hypercholesterolemia.

Hypercholesterolemia Diagnosis
• Eruptive xanthomas over the trunk, back, elbows, buttocks, knees, hands, and feet may be present
in severe elevations of triglycerides.
• Palmar and tuberous xanthomas are seen in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia
There may also be evidence of vascular disease, such as elevated neck veins or bibasal crepitations on
lung auscultation (heart failure), hemiplegia (stroke), or diminished pulses (peripheral arterial disease).
Investigations
Usually lipids are measured in the fasting state. This includes total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, high-
density lipoprotein (HDL), and estimated low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-
C), defined as the subtraction of HDL-C from TC, is a marker of cholesterol carried by pro-atherogenic
lipoproteins: very low-density lipoprotein and remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins, LDL, and
lipoprotein(a).[34] [35] Non-HDL-C, as well as TC, HDL-C, and apolipoproteins B and A-I, can be
measured in nonfasting states. However, evidence showed that even LDL can be accurately estimated
in nonfasting states if triglyceride levels are <400 mg/dL, especially if the outdated Friedewald estimation
is updated to modern higher precision methods (Martin-Hopkins method).[36] Extremely high lipid levels
may give a lactescent (milky) appearance to blood plasma.
Routine thyroid-stimulating hormone test is used to assess for hypothyroidism as an underlying cause
of elevated lipid levels. Additional tests may be indicated by the history and exam findings to identify
complications of hypercholesterolemia. These may include creatinine levels, fasting blood glucose
and glycated hemoglobin, urinalysis, ECG, echocardiogram, cardiac stress testing, cardiac computed
tomography to measure coronary calcium scores or luminal obstruction, cardiac catheterization, and
vascular studies such as Doppler exam or ankle-brachial indices.
Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)
Healthcare providers should have heightened awareness of patients with potential undiagnosed FH.
Heterozygous FH is a common disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 250 individuals.[37] Patients
with LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL, physical findings of FH (tendinous xanthomata, arcus
cornealis onset before the age of 45 years), or a personal or familial history of premature atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease with LDL-C ≥155 mg/dL should be considered for referral to a lipid clinic, formal
evaluation for FH, and/or genetic testing. Importantly, for patients already on lipid-lowering therapy,
pretreatment LDL-C levels should be accessed to evaluate for FH. If not available, providers should
estimate pretreatment LDL-C levels based on the achieved levels and the potency of lipid-lowering
therapy. For instance, an LDL-C of 120 mg/dL on a high-intensity statin may be the result of a 50%
reduction from a baseline LDL-C of around 240 mg/dL. Homozygous FH is a rare but life-threatening
disease, affecting 1 in 250,000-360,000 people.[38] Early identification and specialist referral are
essential and European consensus recommends screening for homozygous FH whenever it is suspected
clinically and/or with premature ASCVD.[38] Untreated LDL-C levels >400 mg/dL (>10 mmol/L) are
suggestive of homozygous FH.[38]
Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria (DLCNC) may be used to evaluate for FH (see table).[39] Definite,
probable, possible, and unlikely FH are diagnosed as with >8 points, 6-8 points, 3-5 points, and <3 points,
respectively. The 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Position Statement on FH highlights that there
is no definitive gold standard for the diagnosis of FH. Current scoring systems, such as the DLCNC,
rely on a scoring system to increase confidence in the diagnosis. The key message is that clinicians
should consider the diagnosis when caring for individuals with very elevated levels of LDL-C and seek
supportive findings. The Canadian Statement suggests the following screening criteria: LDL-C ≥193 mg/

dL in those ≥40 years old; ≥174 mg/dL in those ages 18-39 years old; and ≥154 mg/dL in individuals <18
years old.[40] The 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines
recommend considering FH in patients with coronary heart disease under the age of 55 in men or 60
years in women, in those with family members with premature cardiovascular disease, in patients with
relatives who have xanthomas, in adults with LDL >190 mg/dL or children with LDL >154 mg/dL, and
those with a first-degree relative with FH.[41]
Genetic testing has an important role in the management of patients with potential FH. First, it can help
to confirm a diagnosis, though a pathogenic variant in the most common genes is only identified in 30%
to 80% of individuals with clinical FH.[40] More importantly, when these genes are identified, it facilitates
cascade screening of family members, which is critical. Even when a gene is not identified, screening of
first-degree relatives with lipid testing should be performed.[40] [42] Another important reason to perform
genetic testing is for prognostication. Individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia and an FH mutation
have an odds ratio for coronary artery disease that is 22-fold higher than those with LDL-C <130 mg/dL,
as compared with an odds ratio that is 6-fold higher in those with severe hypercholesterolemia and similar
LDL-C levels but no FH mutation.[43]

[e.g., occurring in male first-degree relatives under 55 years old and in female first-degree relatives
under 60-65 years old]) suggests primary hypercholesterolemia.[41] [44]
history of cardiovascular disease (common)
• Most patients with hypercholesterolemia are not diagnosed until premature cardiovascular disease
becomes symptomatic.
• It is important to assess lipid profiles in patients presenting with angina, myocardial infarction, stroke,
and peripheral vascular disease.
consumption of saturated fats and trans-fatty acids (common)
• Sedentary lifestyle and a diet characterized by excessive consumption of saturated fats and trans-fatty
acids.[14]
excess body weight (especially abdominal obesity) (common)
• A body mass index >25 kg/m² and a waist circumference that is >94 cm in white and black men, >80
cm in white and black women, >90 cm in Asian men, and >80 cm in Asian women is associated with a
variety of unfavorable changes in lipid metabolism.[23][24]
xanthelasmas (common)
• Yellow plaques that occur most commonly near the inner canthus of the eyelid.

• Half of these lesions are associated with elevated plasma lipid levels.[45]
• Some occur with altered lipoprotein composition or structure, such as lowered high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels.
• They frequently occur in patients with type II and IV hyperlipidemia.
tendinous xanthomas (uncommon)
• Slowly enlarging subcutaneous nodules related to the tendons or the ligaments.
• The extensor tendons of the hands, feet, and Achilles tendons are the most common locations. A

Other diagnostic factors
arcus cornealis with onset before the age of 45 years (uncommon)
• White or gray opaque ring in the corneal margin.
• The result of cholesterol deposits in the hyalinosis of the corneal stroma; can be seen in patients with
ocular defects or familial hyperlipidemia.
tuberous xanthomas (uncommon)
• Firm, painless, red-yellow nodules.
• Multilobulated tumors can develop once individual lesions coalesce.
• Usually related to pressure areas, such as the extensor surfaces of the knees, elbows, and buttocks.
• Particularly associated with hypercholesterolemia and increased levels of low-density lipoprotein. They
can be associated with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia and familial hypercholesterolemia, and they
may be present in some of the secondary hyperlipidemias.
Risk factors
Strong
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus
• Hypercholesterolemia due to increased very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and
expressed by high total cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) but not
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can be seen in the context of mixed dyslipidemia, and is
associated with insulin resistance.[21]
• LDL-C levels are not increased in insulin resistance. However, the number of apoB-containing
lipoproteins, such as VLDL-C, is increased. HDL-C and the number of apoA-I particles are usually
reduced in insulin resistance. A correlation exists between severity of insulin resistance and degree
of lipoprotein abnormalities: greater degrees of insulin resistance are associated with increased VLDL
production, reduced clearance, larger VLDL particles, and smaller LDL and HDL particles.[22]
• The total number of LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein, and VLDL particles is also increased in
patients with insulin resistance.
excess body weight (body mass index >25 kg/m²)
• Weight gain is associated with increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. However
when abdominal obesity is present, it is associated with a variety of unfavorable changes in lipid
metabolism, similar to those found in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.[22] [23] This includes a
waist circumference that is >94 cm in white and black men, >80 cm in white and black women, >90 cm
in Asian men, and >80 cm in Asian women.[23] [24]
• Loss of body fat may partially reverse hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.
hypothyroidism
• In a study of patients with primary hypothyroidism, 56% had isolated hypercholesterolemia and
another 34% had combined hypercholesterolemia with hypertriglyceridemia.[28]
• In another study of patients referred to a lipid disorder specialty clinic, the rate of overt hypothyroidism
was found to be 2.8%, and 4.4% of patients had subclinical hypothyroidism.[29]
• The severity of lipid abnormalities increases with the severity of the hypothyroidism.

Hypercholesterolemia Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Because of this association, it is appropriate to assess thyroid-stimulating hormone in any patient
presenting with dyslipidemia.
cholestatic liver disease
• Lipoprotein-X (an abnormal low-density lipoprotein in cholestatic conditions) plays a major role in
the pathogenesis of hypercholesterolemia observed with primary biliary cirrhosis and similar hepatic
disorders.
• In these disorders, serum cholesterol concentrations may exceed 500 mg/dL and physical stigmata
such as xanthomas may be found.
Weak
cigarette smoking
• Patients smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day had a mild reduction of high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol.[25] This reduction may be more pronounced in the setting of concomitant alcohol
intake.[26]
• It has been suggested that smoking may induce insulin resistance, with associated increases in the
size and number of low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein particles.[27]
nephrotic syndrome
• Hyperlipidemia observed in patients with nephrotic syndrome is partially due to a reduction in lipid
catabolism. The low oncotic pressure seen in these patients is thought to lead to increased hepatic
synthesis of lipoproteins.
use of certain medications
• Mild alterations of lipid metabolism can occur with drug therapy for other medical conditions. The
mechanisms for this differ in each drug class.
• Medications commonly implicated are high-dose thiazide diuretics, oral estrogens, glucocorticoids,
anabolic steroids (also reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and atypical antipsychotics, such
as olanzapine and clozapine.
• The use of protease inhibitors in HIV infection is associated with a class-related side effect termed
lipodystrophy syndrome, which has marked abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism. The acne
treatment drug isotretinoin is also associated with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

lipid profile
• Consists of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and LDL-, HDL-, and
non-HDL-cholesterol.
• TC, non HDL, and HDL can be measured in the nonfasting state.
Accuracy of LDL-cholesterol is preserved between fasting and
nonfasting situations when the Martin-Hopkins formula is used,
whereas estimated LDL-cholesterol by older methods (Friedewald
formula) commonly underestimates LDL-cholesterol at low levels.[36]
Non-HDL-cholesterol (which is calculated by the formula TC-HDL-
cholesterol) is an independent marker of cardiovascular events and
can be measured in nonfasting states.[34] [35]
• TC values vary by 10% and triglycerides by up to 25% day to day,
even in the absence of disease.[46]
• Plasma or serum can be used, with plasma cholesterol being
approximately 3% higher than the serum value.[47]
• Acute illnesses can influence the lipid profile. Triglycerides increase
and cholesterol levels decrease in inflammatory states. In particular,
lipid profiles change significantly 24 hours after an acute myocardial
infarction, and measurement should either be performed acutely or
postponed until after recovery.[48]

cholesterol >100 mg/dL;

genetic testing
• Genetic testing can help to confirm a diagnosis of familial
hypercholesterolemia, though a pathogenic variant in the most
common genes is only identified in 30% to 80% of individuals with
clinical familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).[40] More importantly,
when these genes are identified, it facilitates cascade screening
of family members, which is critical. Even when a gene is not
identified, screening of first-degree relatives with lipid testing
should be performed.[40] [42] Another important reason to perform
genetic testing is for prognostication. Individuals with severe
hypercholesterolemia and an FH mutation have an odds ratio for
coronary artery disease that is 22-fold higher than those with LDL-C
<130 mg/dL, as compared with an odds ratio that is 6-fold higher in
those with severe hypercholesterolemia and similar LDL-C levels but
no FH mutation.[43]

The following are broad traditional categories from the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines of the
National Cholesterol Education Program for reference in interpreting lipid results, but it is important to tailor
LDL-C and other lipid goals to the individual patient. For example, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology/
European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines recommend LDL-C <55 mg/dL in those at very high risk for
cardiovascular disease and in secondary prevention.[41]
LDL-C:

• High: ≥60 mg/dL
Screening
There is a well-established link between hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease, and a high
incidence and prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in high-income countries. Lowering of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) leads to a reduction of cardiovascular events in moderate-to-high-risk
patients.
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology guidelines
recommend that all adults 20 years of age or older should be evaluated for dyslipidemia every 5 years, with
more frequent testing recommended as patients become older.[50] In the UK and Europe, lipid screening
usually starts at age 40.[41] [51] Screening may begin earlier for those with diabetes in childhood or a family
history of dyslipidemia, and the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines
additionally recommend screening as early as age 2 years for those with a family history suggestive of early
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).[44] The US Preventive Services Task Force found that the
current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in
asymptomatic children and adolescents ages 20 years or younger.[52]

Hypercholesterolemia Management
Approach
Several treatment options exist for hypercholesterolemia, which may be instituted individually or in
combination. They include lifestyle changes to diet and exercise, medications, and dietary supplements.
Rarely, experimental therapies or procedural interventions can be applied.
International guidelines have reinforced the role of pharmacologic treatment to reduce cholesterol based on
the risk of cardiovascular events.[44] [51][54][56] Despite some differences in suggested risk stratification
tools and cholesterol goals, the guidelines are unanimous in recommending intensive pharmacologic
treatment and, consequently, robust cholesterol reduction with statins in high-risk patients - primarily those
with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (coronary heart disease [CHD] or non-coronary forms
of atherosclerotic disease, such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid artery
disease [e.g., transient ischemic attacks, stroke of carotid origin, or >50% obstruction of a carotid artery]).
However, less intensive regimens may be instituted in lower-risk patients. 
Management of patients diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia requires specialist consultation.
Risk stratification
The net benefit that each patient receives from preventive therapies is directly related to the baseline
cardiovascular risk (i.e., those at the highest risk will derive the greatest absolute risk reductions from
preventive interventions). Therefore, it is critical to perform adequate risk stratification to serve as the
basis for a risk discussion and framework to decide on the intensity of preventive strategies. Individuals
with clinical ASCVD have a high risk for recurrent events. Within this strata, those with recurrent major
ASCVD events (symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or recent
acute coronary syndrome) are at greatest risk for repeat events.
In adult patients without previous ASCVD, risk scores may be used for risk estimation. Several are
available, such as Framingham, QRISK, PROCAM, the Pooled Cohort Equations, and SCORE2 and
SCORE2-OP.  [QRISK risk calculator] (http://www.qrisk.org)   [Pooled Cohort Equations CV Risk
Calculator] (https://professional.heart.org/professional/GuidelinesStatements/ASCVDRiskCalculator/
UCM_457698_ASCVD-Risk-Calculator.jsp)  Another tool, developed by the American Heart Association,
the Primary Prevention Risk Assessment Tool (PREVENT) calculator, helps healthcare providers evaluate
an individual's 10-year risk of developing ASCVD by considering various clinical and lifestyle factors.
[57] When applied to populations similar to their derivation cohort, these tools perform well. Therefore,
healthcare providers should be familiar with the best risk prediction tool in their patient population.[53] [58]
When using the Pooled Cohort Equations, patients may be classified according to their predicted 10-
year risk of ASCVD events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke): low risk (<5%), borderline
risk (5.0% to <7.5%), intermediate risk (≥7.5% to <20%), and high risk (>20%). In borderline- and
intermediate-risk patients, clinical and laboratory risk-enhancing factors may be considered to decide
the use of lipid-lowering therapies. These factors include: a family history of premature ASCVD (men
ages <55 years, women <65 years), primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-cholesterol ≥160 mg/dL or non-
HDL-cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL), metabolic syndrome, estimated GFR 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m², chronic
inflammatory conditions (psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS), premature menopause, preeclampsia,
South Asian ancestry, elevated high-sensitivity CRP (≥2 mg/L), elevated lipoprotein(a) (>50 mg/dL or
>125 nmol/L), elevated apolipoprotein B (≥130 mg/dL), or an ankle-brachial index <0.9.[44] [53] [59]

Hypercholesterolemia Management
MANAGEMENT
In patients with borderline- or intermediate-risk after the use of risk scores and risk enhancers (if present),
coronary artery calcium (CAC) may be used as a decision aid if it will affect the intensity of preventive
strategies, particularly lipid-lowering therapies.[44] [53]
Patients with clinical manifestations of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease should be treated with
lipid-modifying therapies, usually a statin if not contraindicated, in addition to lifestyle modifications. In
people at lower levels of risk, pharmacologic therapy is usually indicated if lifestyle changes are ineffective
in the short term (3-6 months). There is evidence that statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events and
mortality in people without clinical cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors present.[60]
[61] Moreover, there is evidence that reductions in risk are similar in men and women at comparable risk
for cardiovascular disease.[62]
The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration has shown reduction in both mortality and
cardiovascular disease by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of the presence of
cardiovascular disease.[60] This meta-analysis evaluated the effects of statins versus placebo, more
potent versus less potent, and higher versus lower dose statins for approximately 5 years. This work
clearly showed the benefits of LDL lowering in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality,
even in subjects without overt hypercholesterolemia and solely in the presence of risk factors for
cardiovascular disease. One meta-analysis from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
confirmed the CTT results, including benefits on mortality.[61] In the current era, the cost-effectiveness of
statin treatment is broadly applicable to nearly all primary and secondary risk populations.[63]
In patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or HIV, American Heart
Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend a fasting lipid profile and assessment
of ASCVD risk factors before and 4-12 weeks after starting inflammatory disease-modifying therapy or
antiretroviral therapy, to aid decision-making on initiating and adjusting lipid-lowering therapy.[44]
Lifestyle modification
Lifestyle changes are recommended for all patients. There is clear evidence that dietary reduction in total
and saturated fat, weight loss in overweight patients, aerobic exercise, and the addition of plant stanols/
sterols to the diet leads to a decrease in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and an increase in HDL-cholesterol
(HDL-C).[30] [64] [65] [66]
The implementation of dietary change can be difficult for many patients, and it may be helpful to include
a dietician in the patient's care. A reduced intake of cholesterol and saturated fats should be advised, as
well as increased consumption of dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, and unsaturated fats.[14] [31] 
One large UK study in more than 2500 patients found that with diet alone, LDL-C was lowered by 5%
to 7% in 60% of patients, who also achieved a mean reduction in body weight of 1.8%.[67] A meta-
analysis of 37 studies testing step I and step II diets (concentration of saturated fat <10% and <7%,
respectively) showed an average 13% reduction in LDL-C. A meta-analysis of 23 controlled trials showed
a 7% reduction of LDL-C with soy supplementation and 19% reduction in LDL-C with a Mediterranean diet.
Diets rich in soluble fiber reduce LDL-C 2% per gram of ingested fiber per day.[68] Plant-based diets have
been associated with reduction in LDL-C, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B.[69] [70]
The effect of aerobic exercise and diet has been studied in 377 men and women with low HDL- and high
LDL-C. Significant reductions in LDL were found in the diet and exercise group compared with control or
diet alone.[71]

Hypercholesterolemia Management
Patients with average or low cardiovascular risk can be allowed 3-6 months of lifestyle modification before
considering lipid-lowering drugs.[72] However, this length of time remains controversial; two to three
follow-up visits over 2-3 months should be arranged to assess motivation and adherence.
Drug therapy: statins
When lifestyle changes alone are not adequate in reducing cholesterol to guideline-directed levels, drug
therapy with statins is recommended as a first-line option. In patients with extremely elevated LDL-C
(>190 mg/dL) and those at high cardiovascular risk, drug therapy must accompany diet and exercise as
an initial therapeutic approach.[44] [48][51]
The CTT Collaboration has shown that for every 39 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, there is a relative risk
reduction of 10% for all-cause mortality, 20% for deaths due to coronary heart disease, 27% for nonfatal
myocardial infarction, 25% for coronary revascularization, and 21% for ischemic stroke.[60]
One expanded meta-analysis from the USPSTF and one Cochrane review confirm a reduction of all-
cause mortality and major cardiovascular events.[61] [73] [74] The USPSTF recommends that adults ages
40-75 years who have one or more cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension,
or smoking) and an estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater should be started
on a statin. Those with 10-year risk of 7.5% to less than 10% may selectively be offered a statin.[73] Trial
data support the use of statins in ethnically diverse intermediate-risk individuals without cardiovascular
disease.[75] Higher doses are used in patients with acute coronary syndrome because of the role statins
play in plaque stabilization.
Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol
synthesis, which leads to upregulation of LDL receptors and increased LDL clearance. Reductions of LDL
with statins range from 20% to 55%, depending on the type and dose of statin chosen.[76]
A moderate-intensity statin has been defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association as one that generally lowers LDL-C level by 30% to 49%, while a high-intensity statin has
been defined as one that lowers LDL-C level by ≥50%.[44]
Statin therapy should be started in patients who fall into the following groups:
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines:[44]
• Presence of ASCVD, not at very high risk of future events: treat patients ages ≤75 years with high-
intensity statin (daily dose lowers LDL-C by ≥50%) or with moderate-intensity statin (daily dose
lowers LDL-C 30% to <50%) if high-intensity therapy is not tolerated; treat patients ages >75 years
with moderate- or high-intensity statin.
• Presence of ASCVD, at very high risk of future events: treat with high-intensity or maximal statin
therapy. Very high risk is defined as a history of multiple major ASCVD events (recent acute
coronary syndrome [within the past 12 months], myocardial infarction other than the recent acute
coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [claudication with
ankle brachial index <0.85, previous revascularization, or amputation]) or one major ASCVD
event and multiple high-risk conditions (age ≥65 years, heterozygous family history, history of
previous coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, current smoking, persistently elevated LDL-C [≥100 mg/dL]
despite maximally tolerated therapy, history of congestive heart failure).

Hypercholesterolemia Management
MANAGEMENT
• People ages 20-75 years with primary elevations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL: this group is enriched with
patients who have familial hypercholesterolemia and are high risk on the basis of LDL-C alone; do
not estimate 10-year risk in this group; treat with a high-intensity statin or moderate-intensity statin
if not a candidate for high-intensity statin therapy.
• People ages 40-75 years with diabetes mellitus: start moderate-intensity statin in those who
have an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of <7.5% and no
additional high risk factors. Start high-intensity statin in those who are at higher risk.
• People without ASCVD or diabetes ages 40-75 years with LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL: estimate 10-year
risk and if borderline risk, 5.0% to <7.5%, and risk enhancers are present, then discuss moderate-
intensity statin therapy; the patient-clinician discussion should consider the potential for ASCVD
risk-reduction benefits and adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences for
treatment. Risk enhancers include: family history of premature ASCVD; persistently elevated LDL-
C ≥160 mg/dL; chronic kidney disease; metabolic syndrome; conditions specific to women (e.g.,
preeclampsia, premature menopause); inflammatory diseases (especially rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis, HIV); ethnicity factors (e.g., South Asian ancestry); elevated high-sensitivity CRP ≥2
mg/dL; elevated lipoprotein(a) >50 mg/dL or >125 nmol/L, elevated apolipoprotein B ≥130 mg/
dL, ankle-brachial index <0.9. If intermediate risk, ≥7.5% to <20%, and risk enhancers are present,
start moderate-intensity statin therapy; if uncertain can use CAC score (CAC=0: lowers risk;
consider no statin unless diabetes, family history of premature CHD, smoking; CAC=1-99: favours
statin, especially if age >55 years; CAC=100+ and/or ≥75th percentile: begin statin). If high risk,
≥20%, start high-intensity statin therapy.
• People with heart failure: do not routinely initiate statin therapy in patients requiring hemodialysis or
with class III or IV heart failure.
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) guidelines:[51]
• Presence of ASCVD or secondary prevention: start high-dose atorvastatin in the absence of
contraindications.For secondary prevention of CVD, the goal is to achieve LDL cholesterol <77
mg/dL (≤2.0 mmol/L), or non-HDL cholesterol 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). High-dose atorvastatin
is recommended for individuals with CVD, regardless of their cholesterol level, unless any of the
following conditions apply: potential drug interactions (e.g., with clarithromycin, systemic azoles,
or other antifungal agents); a high risk of adverse effects (e.g., in older people, people with low
muscle mass or impaired renal function); or a patient preference for a lower dose.[Evidence A]
[Evidence B]
• Offer atorvastatin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) to people who have a
10% or greater 10-year risk of developing CVD (estimated with QRISK3).  [QRISK risk calculator]
(http://www.qrisk.org)
• Offer atorvastatin for the primary prevention of CVD to people with type 1 diabetes who are ages
>40 years, have had diabetes for more than 10 years, have established nephropathy, or have other
CVD risk factors.
• Offer atorvastatin for the primary prevention of CVD to people with type 2 diabetes who have a
≥10% 10-year risk of developing CVD (estimated with QRISK3).  [QRISK risk calculator] (http://
www.qrisk.org)
• Offer atorvastatin for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD to people with chronic kidney
disease. Increase the dose if a >40% reduction in non-HDL-C is not achieved and estimated GFR is
≥30 mL/minute/1.73 m². Discuss the use of higher doses with a renal specialist if estimated GFR is
<30 mL/minute/1.73 m².

Hypercholesterolemia Management
• Follow-up after starting statin treatment: measure total cholesterol, HDL-C and non-HDL-C in
all people who have been started on high-intensity statin treatment at 3 months of treatment,
and aim for a >40% reduction in non-HDL-C. If a >40% reduction in non-HDL-C is not achieved:
discuss adherence and timing of dose; optimize adherence to diet and lifestyle measures; consider
increasing the dose if started on less than 80 mg/day of atorvastatin, and the person is judged to be
at higher risk because of comorbidities, risk score, or using clinical judgment.
International Atherosclerosis Society (IAS) recommendations:[54]
• The IAS does not specifically prescribe “treatment goals” for atherogenic lipoproteins for different
circumstances. Instead, it identifies optimal levels of atherogenic cholesterol and makes the general
statement that the intensity of cholesterol-lowering therapy should be adjusted to long-term risk.
• Most patients with ASCVD deserve maximal statin therapy when it is tolerated. The optimal LDL-
C in patients with established ASCVD is <70 mg/dL(<1.8 mmol/L) (or non-HDL-C of <100 mg/dL
[<2.6 mmol/L]). In many patients adjuvant treatment with other lipid-lowering medications (e.g.,
ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates) might be needed to attain recommended values.
• The IAS suggests that an optimal LDL-C level for primary prevention is <100 mg/dL or non-HDL-
C is <130 mg/dL. The use of statin therapy is recommended according to the lifetime risk of
cardiovascular disease (from ages 50-80 years) as follows: high (≥45%), moderately high (30% to
44%), moderate (15% to 29%), and low (<15%). Most high-risk patients will require statin treatment
to attain an LDL-C level of <100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C of <130 mg/dL); therefore, the use of these
drugs is recommended. Statin use should also be considered in moderately high-risk people and as
optional in moderate-risk people.
• For younger people, especially those with high LDL-C (familial hypercholesterolemia), smoking,
and diabetes clinical algorithms usually underestimate risk and those risk factors must be treated.
Statin treatment must be considered depending on the severity of LDL-C elevations and if other risk
factors are not adequately controlled.
Lifetime risk can be estimated as:

Hypercholesterolemia Management
• While the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS)
dyslipidemia guidelines reference the SCORE risk assessment system, the updated SCORE2
risk assessment is recommended by the 2021 ESC guidelines on cardiovascular disease
prevention.[58] Future lipid guideline iterations will likely update recommendations to this scoring
system. 
Adverse effects of statins are uncommon but include liver enzyme elevations and myositis or
rhabdomyolysis. Muscle toxicity without enzyme elevation has also been reported; this seems to be most
common when some of the statins are used with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., macrolide
antibiotics, HIV protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, and cyclosporine). Some statins (lovastatin,
simvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin) may raise digoxin levels and potentiate the effect of warfarin.
Caution is advised when using statins with these drugs, and lower doses of the statin (or the interacting
drug) may be required. Also, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now recommends that the dose
of simvastatin not exceed 40 mg/day due to the increased risk of myopathy with the 80 mg/day dose. It
recommends that the 80 mg/day dose only be used in patients who have been using this dose for 12
months or longer with no ill effect. For patients who do not respond to 40 mg/day, the FDA recommends
changing to an alternative statin rather than increasing the dose.
Two meta-analyses, one comparing statins with placebo, and the other comparing more intensive
versus less intensive statin treatment, report an increased risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes associated
with statin use.[77] [78] Another study, which looked at 3 large trials, found a slight increased risk of
developing new-onset type 2 diabetes with high-dose atorvastatin, and that baseline fasting glucose and
features of the metabolic syndrome are predictive of new-onset type 2 diabetes.[79] One large trial of
rosuvastatin showed that while statin therapy increased the risk of diabetes mellitus, this hazard was
exceeded by the cardiovascular benefits of statins, with 134 vascular events or deaths avoided for every
54 new cases of diabetes diagnosed.[80]
In patients with chronic kidney disease, a study looking at the association of simvastatin and ezetimibe,
and a meta-analysis of the main lipid-lowering trials in chronic kidney disease patients, confirmed the
importance of reducing cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular disease in these populations.[81]
Adverse effects are more common in older patients, those with multiple diseases, and those on multiple
drugs. In some people, changing from one statin to another or lowering the dose may ameliorate negative
effects.
Older studies have suggested that aggressive lipid lowering may have adverse effects on the brain,
leading to cognitive impairment, dementia, and hemorrhagic stroke. However, a review of current
evidence and scientific statement by the American Heart Association concludes that there is no
association. The risk of hemorrhagic stroke with lipid-lowering treatment among patients with a history of
hemorrhagic stroke is noted as not being robust and requiring further study.[82]
Data from some of the earliest statin trials have emerged documenting the long-term safety and efficacy
of statin therapy. In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study primary prevention trial, statin
therapy led to a substantial reduction in cardiovascular disease outcomes in two decades without new
safety concerns.[83] Similarly favorable findings were documented regarding the effectiveness of statin
therapy in 16-year follow-up of the Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease trial, a
secondary prevention trial.[84] Regarding long-term safety there was no impact of statins on cancer or
noncardiovascular mortality during long-term follow-up.

Hypercholesterolemia Management
MANAGEMENT
Drug therapy: nonstatin options
Statins are a very safe class of drugs. However, many patients do not achieve adequate LDL-C lowering
and up to 10% of people are intolerant, especially where muscular symptoms are concerned.[85] There
is no consensus regarding treatment of patients intolerant to statins. Changing from one statin to another
or reducing dose/intensity may improve tolerance. In addition, alternate-day dose therapy, either with or
without daily ezetimibe, has been proposed for these patients. One systematic review of every other day
administration of statins suggests that when more potent statins such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin
are used, similar LDL-C reductions to every-day treatment are attained.[85] However, tolerance was not
adequately evaluated in most of these studies. In addition, studies are hindered by the small numbers
of subjects and short-term follow-ups. Finally, alternate-day therapy may lead to either missed or extra
doses.
Complete statin intolerance is rare; however, for these patients, a trial of nonstatin LDL-C lowering drugs
may be considered as an alternative to statins, with referral to a lipid specialist.[41] [56]
For patients who do not achieve adequate LDL-C lowering on maximally tolerated statin therapy, addition
of nonstatin therapies may be considered.[41] [44] [56]
1. Ezetimibe
• Impairs dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption at the intestinal brush border by interaction with
specific receptors and, in contrast to bile acid sequestrants, results in systemic exposure.
• Can also be used alone or in addition to statin therapy and lifestyle changes. Effective for lipid
lowering in patients with mild-to-moderate elevations of LDL-C; however, with an average of 20%
LDL-C lowering it may not be sufficient for patients in need of greater LDL-C lowering. If used alone,
LDL reductions of 15% to 20% have been reported.[86] In conjunction with simvastatin, LDL was
lowered an additional 14% above the effect achieved with simvastatin alone.[87]
• The IMPROVE-IT trial showed that ezetimibe plus simvastatin reduced the relative and absolute
risks of major cardiovascular events in high-risk coronary heart disease individuals in comparison
with simvastatin alone.[88] The benefit of ezetimibe is proportional to its LDL-C-lowering ability.[89]
• The EWTOPIA 75 trial, which randomized patients ages 75 years or older without ASCVD to
ezetimibe versus placebo, showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and coronary
revascularization in the ezetimibe arm compared with placebo.[90]
2. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies)
• PCSK9 binds LDL receptors, facilitating their degradation. When in excess, PCSK9 is a cause of
familial hypercholesterolemia. Loss-of-function mutations are associated with lower LDL-C levels
and a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.[91]
• Human monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9 (e.g., evolocumab and alirocumab) provide
three times the effect of ezetimibe (60% LDL-C lowering).
• PCSK9 inhibitors significantly reduce LDL-C by approximately 50% to 60% and result in greater
LDL-C goal achievement when added to statins in a variety of populations, including those with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.[92]
• The FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trials assessing evolocumab and alirocumab,
respectively, have shown that PCSK9 inhibition reduces cardiovascular events in individuals with
high risk for cardiovascular disease.[93] [94] [95] [96]
• In FOURIER (n = 27,564; patients with previous manifestation of ASCVD) the addition of
evolocumab to statin therapy compared with statin therapy alone resulted in a 15% relative

risk reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 20% relative risk reduction in the combined
secondary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality. Baseline median LDL-C was
90 mg/dL and was reduced to a median 30 mg/dL with evolocumab. To prevent one clinical event
of the primary and secondary end points, 66 and 50 individuals, respectively, would need to be
treated for 2 years. Evolocumab use in the trial led to a 20% to 25% relative risk reduction in total
myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularizations during the study period.[97] A
pre-established analysis found a direct continuous association of LDL-C lowering with reduction
in cardiovascular events with benefits up to LDL-C of 10 mg/dL and with the greatest benefits
in those individuals who attained LDL-C <20 mg/dL.[98] Evolocumab was well tolerated, there
were no significant differences between groups in adverse events (including new-onset diabetes
and neurocognitive events), except for injection-site reactions, which were more common with
evolocumab (2.1% vs. 1.6%).
• In the FOURIER open-label extension, 6635 patients from the FOURIER study received
evolocumab and were followed up for a median of 5 years (with some, therefore, receiving
evolocumab for more than 8 years in total). The extension study found that patients originally
randomized to evolocumab in the parent FOURIER trial had a lower risk of cardiovascular
events, compared with those originally randomized to placebo, and rates of adverse events were
persistently low.[99] [100]
• A reanalysis of the mortality data from the original FOURIER trial, using regulatory documents
to address discrepancies and restore complete mortality data, reported that the mortality benefit
of evolocumab may be less significant than initially reported.[101] This reanalysis has sparked
controversy. Critics argue that the reanalysis of the FOURIER study is fundamentally flawed
due to its use of incomplete data and a post hoc, unblinded process. They assert that the
original FOURIER trial followed a rigorous, prespecified, blinded event adjudication process
by experienced cardiologists and neurologists, consistent with FDA definitions and regulatory
standards. They emphasize that the original trial's methodology and results were robust and that
the reanalysis improperly reclassified deaths, leading to an erroneous conclusion about the efficacy
of evolocumab.[101]
• EBBINGHAUS, a substudy of FOURIER, found no association of evolocumab treatment with
neurocognitive adverse events tested objectively using the Cambridge Neuropsychological
Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).[102] Further analysis of the FOURIER trial data found that
evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 50% or more in 90.5% of patients
and by 30% or more in 99.8% of patients.[103]
• In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, one multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 18,924
patients, alirocumab reduced the risk of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events (including all-
cause mortality and myocardial infarction) compared with placebo in patients who had a previous
acute coronary syndrome and were receiving high-intensity statin therapy.[95] [96] [104] [105]
• In one meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials comparing PCSK9 inhibitors with placebo, including
38,235 individuals treated for at least 48 weeks, PCSK9 inhibitors decreased myocardial
infarction by 27% and stroke events by 19%, without a significant difference in cardiovascular
mortality. Importantly, however, the study population included both secondary prevention patients
with previous vascular events and individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia but no prior
cardiovascular events. The heterogeneity of baseline risk limits the interpretation of these
findings.[106] One Cochrane review assessing the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors for the
prevention of cardiovascular disease found that both alirocumab and evolocumab decreased the
risk of cardiovascular disease when added to other LDL‐C‐lowering medications (e.g., statins or
ezetimibe) and there is a strong evidence base for PCSK9 inhibitors in people who might not be

eligible for other lipid‐lowering drugs or those who cannot meet lipid goals on other therapies. There
are limited data on the benefits of PCSK9 inhibitors compared with other therapies, and limited
evidence on potential safety issues.[107] 
• In the US, alirocumab is approved as an adjunct to diet, alone, or in combination with other lipid-
lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia
(including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) to reduce LDL-C; as an adjunct to other LDL-
lowering therapies in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to reduce LDL-C; and
to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in
adults with established cardiovascular disease.
• In the US, evolocumab is approved as an adjunct to diet, alone, or in combination with other lipid-
lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia
(including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) to reduce LDL-C; as an adjunct to diet
and other LDL-lowering therapies in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who
require additional lowering of LDL-C; and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and
coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.
3. Bile acid sequestrants
• Effective in patients with mild-to-moderate elevations of LDL-cholesterol.
• Bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine and colesevelam can be used as adjuvant
therapies to statins and ezetimibe in cases of severe hypercholesterolemia, in patients with
high risk of coronary heart disease, when LDL-C goals are not attained, and generally in familial
hypercholesterolemia patients. Ezetimibe blocks about 50% of cholesterol absorption, and bile acid
sequestrants can work on the remaining cholesterol in the intestinal lumen. There is evidence that
both colesevelam and cholestyramine potentiate the lowering effect of ezetimibe on cholesterol
levels. Also, in sitosterolemia (a rare condition), bile acid sequestrants can be added to ezetimibe to
reduce phytosterol and cholesterol levels.
• Bile acid sequestrants work by binding bile acids in the intestine and preventing their reabsorption.
Through this process, about 90% of bile acids are extracted. The loss of cholesterol-rich bile acids
leads to a lowering of intrahepatic cholesterol and an upregulation of LDL receptors. Increased
receptor density in the liver results in further reduction of blood cholesterol. LDL reductions ranging
from 10% to 24% can be achieved depending upon the dose used.[108]
• Most adverse effects are related to the gastrointestinal tract and include nausea, bloating,
cramping, and increased hepatic transaminases. For many patients these adverse effects are very
limiting.
• The absorption of other drugs can be significantly impaired. Take other drugs 1 hour before or 4
hours after bile acid sequestrants.
• Formally contraindicated in patients with triglycerides >500 mg/dL.
The threshold for considering additional nonstatin therapy varies depending on risk. If target LDL-C
lowering is not achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, additional nonstatin therapies may be
considered, such as ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 inhibitor (monoclonal antibody).[41] [44] [56] Newer
nonstatin therapies (e.g., bempedoic acid, inclisiran) are also approved; they may not yet be included
in guidelines and you should consult your local protocols.[56] See Emerging treatments  for more
information.  
The decision to add nonstatin therapies should be shared between patient and clinician after a discussion
on risks, benefits, and patient preferences. Lifestyle modifications should be optimized, in addition to
reviewing adherence to statins.[56]

Hypercholesterolemia Management
Treatment of older patients
There is controversy in the literature whether older patients should be treated with lipid-modifying therapy.
As compared with younger patients, older individuals are at an increased risk of ASCVD. However,
cholesterol loses its impact as a risk factor in older patients and there is no consensus whether statins
should be prescribed to asymptomatic older patients with hypercholesterolemia. The PROSPER study
that evaluated the effects of pravastatin treatment in subjects ages 70-82 years found that in primary
prevention, statin treatment was effective only in those subjects with HDL-C 45 mg/dL, where a relative
33% reduction was found.[109] One meta-analysis of 8 studies enrolling 24,674 primary prevention
subjects ages >65 years (42.7% females; mean age 73.0 ± 2.9 years; mean follow-up 3.5 ± 1.5 years)
showed that statins, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by 39.4% (relative
risk: 0.606, 95% CI 0.434 to 0.847; p = 0.003) and the risk of stroke by 23.8% (relative risk: 0.762, 95% CI
0.626 to 0.926; p = 0.006).[110] However, there was no mortality benefit. 
Large cohort data have shown an increase in major adverse cardiovascular events in adults ages 75
years or older deprescribed from statins, compared with those continuing statins in both primary and
secondary prevention cohorts.[111]
One meta-analysis from the CTT collaboration showed a similar relative reduction in the risk of ASCVD
events per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C with statin therapy in individuals over the age of 75 years old, as
compared with younger patients.[112]
Therefore, both ESC/EAS and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines
recommend statin therapy for patients over the age of 75 years old with a prior ASCVD event. In primary
prevention, guidelines recommend considering statin therapy in this age group. The guidelines also
highlight the need for increased awareness for adverse events in this population, particularly in the
presence of comorbidities, impaired renal or liver function, and polypharmacy.[41] [44]

Hypercholesterolemia Management
MANAGEMENT
Emerging
Bempedoic acid
Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that is converted to bempedoyl-CoA, its active form, in the liver. It inhibits
adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase, an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, upstream to 3-
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (target of statins). Similarly to statins, bempedoic acid inhibits
cholesterol biosynthesis, triggering an up-regulation of the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-
receptor, which ultimately leads to increasing clearance of LDL particles and lowering of LDL-cholesterol
(LDL-C). Unlike statins, however, bempedoic acid is not activated in skeletal muscles, thus making it
theoretically less prone to be associated with muscular adverse effects. In the phase 3 CLEAR Wisdom
trial, 779 patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) despite maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy
were randomized to bempedoic acid versus placebo for 12 weeks. Bempedoic acid was associated with
a 15% reduction in LDL-C from baseline at 12 weeks.[113] In the CLEAR Outcomes trial, statin-intolerant
patients receiving bempedoic acid had a 21.7% reduction in LDL-C at 6 months, compared with 0.6%
reduction with placebo, and also had a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (death from
cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization).[114]
[115] An associated reduction in major cardiovascular events was also seen in a subgroup of participants
without previous cardiovascular event (primary prevention).[116] In the US, bempedoic acid is approved as
an adjunct to diet, either alone or in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, for the treatment of
adults with primary lipidemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It is also approved in the
US to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization in adults who are unable to take
statin therapy with established cardiovascular disease, or a high risk for a cardiovascular disease event but
without established cardiovascular disease. Based on the CLEAR Outcomes trial, bempedoic acid is now
indicated as the first nonstatin LDL-C lowering medication for primary prevention patients, broadening the
treatable population to approximately 70 million individuals in the US. In Europe, bempedoic acid is approved
for the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed
dyslipidemia. It is also approved in Europe for the treatment of adults with established or at high risk for
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels. In the UK,
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends bempedoic acid in combination
with a statin or a statin plus other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach L D L ‑ C  goals with the
maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients
who cannot tolerate or cannot be given statins.[117]
Inclisiran
Inclisiran is a small interfering RNA drug that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
synthesis in the liver. This drug has a long duration of action, which allows for dosing at long intervals. In
the ORION-1 phase 2 clinical trial, 501 individuals with elevated LDL-C despite maximally tolerated statin
therapy were given one dose or two doses (baseline and 90 days) or placebo. The time-averaged reduction
in LDL-C levels over 1 year ranged from 30% to 39% after a single dose and from 30% to 46% after two
doses.[118] Sustained reductions in LDL-C and PCSK9 concentrations over 4 years were seen with inclisiran
in the ORION-1 open-label extension (ORION-3) and it was well tolerated.[119] The ORION-9 phase 3
randomized controlled trial, which included 482 adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia found
that those who received inclisiran had significantly lower levels of LDL-C than those who received placebo,
with an infrequent dosing regimen and an acceptable safety profile.[120] ORION-10 and ORION-11 were
randomized controlled trials that included patients with ASCVD and patients with ASCVD risk equivalent;
both studies found around 50% reduction in LDL-C in patients who received inclisiran, compared with
placebo; however more injection-site adverse events occurred with inclisiran.[121] A prespecified analysis
of ORION-11, assessing efficacy in primary prevention in those at risk of ASCVD, found that inclisiran was
well tolerated with significant reductions in LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and
apoB.[122] One pooled analysis of ORION-9, ORION-10, and ORION-11 suggested potential benefits in
reducing major cardiovascular events, but this awaits confirmation in larger outcome trials.[123] A post hoc
analysis of ORION-1, -3, -5, -9, -10, -11, and ongoing ORION-8 trials demonstrated that long-term treatment
with inclisiran was well tolerated, without new safety signals, and showed that serious or discontinuation-
inducing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), hepatic, muscle, and kidney events, incident diabetes,
and elevations of creatine kinase or creatinine accrued at a comparable rate between inclisiran and placebo

Hypercholesterolemia Management
for up to 1.5 years, with similar trends continuing for inclisiran beyond this period. Numerically fewer major
cardiovascular events reported as TEAEs occurred with inclisiran, and treatment-induced antidrug antibodies
were uncommon.[124] The VICTORION-INITIATE trial, a phase 3b study, demonstrated that an “inclisiran
first” strategy, where inclisiran was added immediately upon failure to reach LDL-C <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L)
despite maximally tolerated statins, led to significantly greater reductions in LDL-C compared with usual care
(60.0% vs. 7.0%; P <0.001).[125] The ORION-5 trial, a phase 3, multicenter study, assessed the efficacy,
safety, and tolerability of inclisiran in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Despite
substantial lowering of PCSK9 levels, inclisiran did not significantly reduce LDL-C levels compared with
placebo, but it was well-tolerated with no significant differences in adverse events between the groups.[126]
 A cardiovascular outcomes trial (ORION-4) to determine the efficacy of inclisiran is also recruiting patients.
In the US, inclisiran is approved as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy for the treatment of adults with
primary hyperlipidemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, to reduce LDL-C. In Europe,
inclisiran is approved for the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial
and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidemia. In the UK, NICE recommends inclisiran for treating primary
hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet in
adults. It is recommended only if there is a history of cardiovascular events and LDL-C concentrations are
persistently 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) or more, despite maximum tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.[127]
Evinacumab
Evinacumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), a secreted
protein expressed in the liver, which increases plasma concentrations of LDL-C (independent of LDL-receptor
activity), triglycerides, and HDL-C. In the US and Europe, evinacumab is approved as an adjunct to other
LDL-C lowering therapies for the treatment of adults and children (ages 5 years and older in the US and ages
12 years and older in Europe) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It is also being investigated
as a treatment for refractory hypercholesterolemia, in those with or without heterozygous FH. In one phase
2 randomized open-label trial, evinacumab was associated with sustained reductions in LDL-C and was
generally well tolerated.[128]
Sebelipase alfa in lysosomal acid lipase deficiency
Lysosomal acid lipase is an enzyme that is involved in metabolizing endocytosed lipid particles. Lysosomal
acid lipase deficiency is a rare and under-appreciated disorder that causes cirrhosis and severe dyslipidemia.
The safety and effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapy with sebelipase alfa has been studied in
a phase 3 multicenter randomized controlled trial of 66 children and adults with lysosomal acid lipase
deficiency.[129] Among the participants, 58% had baseline LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL and 31% had biopsy-
proven cirrhosis. Sebelipase alfa was administered intravenously every other week for 20 weeks with a
primary end point of alanine aminotransferase normalization. During follow-up there was normalization in the
alanine aminotransferase level in 31% of participants in the sebelipase alfa group versus 7% in the control
group (P = 0.03), with mean changes from baseline of -58 U/L versus -7 U/L (P <0.001). There were also
significant improvements in lipid levels and hepatic fat content, with similar proportions of adverse events
between groups. As such, sebelipase alfa therapy appears a promising therapy for some patients with
lysosomal acid lipase.
Primary prevention
Except for familial causes of hypercholesterolemia, the disease is completely preventable and largely related
to the lifestyle in many high-income countries. Therefore, the adoption of a healthier lifestyle, including
a low-fat diet and a reasonable amount of aerobic exercise, has a large impact on the prevalence of
hypercholesterolemia, as well as of obesity and coronary heart disease.[30] [31] The US Preventive Services
Task Force recommends that adults at increased risk of cardiovascular disease are offered behavioral
counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity; those not at high risk may also be
considered for behavioral counseling interventions.[32] [33]

Hypercholesterolemia Management
MANAGEMENT
Secondary prevention
Dietary reduction in total and saturated fat, weight loss in overweight patients, aerobic exercise, and the
addition of plant stanols/sterols to the diet leads to a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[30] [64] [65] [66] High-intensity statin is generally
recommended in secondary prevention across guidelines, unless otherwise contraindicated.[41] [44] [51]
 In the US, alirocumab is approved for use in the reduction of risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and
unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular disease, and evolocumab
is approved for use in the reduction of risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in
adults with established cardiovascular disease.
Patients should be assessed for the presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking and
diabetes, and appropriate management of these risk factors initiated.
Patient discussions
A reduced intake of saturated fats and cholesterol should be advised, as well as increased consumption
of dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, and unsaturated and monounsaturated fats.[31]
Aerobic exercise, at least 3 times a week, is recommended. US and European guidelines now
recommend 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, or 75-150 minutes per week of
high-intensity exercise, in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention.[41] [59] 
Patients on statins should be encouraged to notify their healthcare professional immediately about any of
the following symptoms of liver problems: unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, upper belly pain,
dark-colored urine, or yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes.[141]

should be monitored every 6 weeks initially until the low-density lipoprotein target is achieved.[34] The
2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias recommend
reassessment of lipid levels 4-6 weeks after an acute coronary event and until lipid levels are at goal.[41]
This interval can be extended to every 6-12 months in patients adherent to lifestyle modifications and after
lipid levels have stabilized.
Baseline liver and muscle enzymes should be measured in patients starting statin therapy, despite the
low incidence of toxicity (0.5% to 2%). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated that there is
no longer any need for routine measurement of liver enzymes with the use of statins. The FDA concluded
that serious liver injury with statins is rare and unpredictable, and that routine periodic monitoring of liver
enzymes does not appear to be effective in detecting or preventing this rare adverse effect.[141]
After initiation of statin therapy, muscle enzyme levels need not be checked regularly unless patients
develop myalgias or other muscle symptoms.[142]
Despite the possible small risk of diabetes onset with the use of statins, there is no formal
recommendation for additional monitoring of glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels, and these
measurements should be done on an individual basis.

Hypercholesterolemia Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
chronic coronary disease long term medium
The likelihood of progression to ischemic cardiomyopathy due to hypercholesterolemia alone depends
on other vascular risk factors. Aggressive risk factor control and management of dyslipidemia is
recommended.
peripheral vascular disease (PVD) long term medium
PVD manifests as insufficient tissue perfusion caused by existing atherosclerosis and chronic narrowing of
the vessel lumen, which may be acutely affected by either emboli or thrombi. It is a very common condition
that has the potential to cause loss of limb or even loss of life. Aggressive control of all existing risk factors
is the mainstay of treatment for chronic PVD.
acute coronary syndrome variable medium
Long-term lipid-lowering therapy with a statin is recommended for people with acute coronary syndrome.
Higher doses are used in patients with acute coronary syndrome because of the role that statins play in
plaque stabilization.
An LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of <70 mg/dL (the European Society of Cardiology/European
Atherosclerosis Society guidelines recommend LDL-C <55 mg/dL) and a non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C)
goal of <100 mg/dL are considered a therapeutic option in these high-risk patients.[41] [135] [136]
In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 18,924 patients,
alirocumab reduced the risk of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events (including all-cause mortality and
myocardial infarction) compared with placebo in patients who had previous acute coronary syndrome and
were receiving high-intensity statin therapy.[95] [96] [104] [105]
stroke variable medium
For patients with thrombotic stroke, the LDL and non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) goals are defined
by the National Cholesterol Education Program as <100 mg/dL and <130 mg/dL, respectively. Patients
with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are at very high risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and should receive intensive lipid-lowering therapy.[41] [44]
It has been shown that many patients hospitalized with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels higher than recommended. Patients at the greatest risk of
cardiovascular events are the least likely to be at guideline-recommended LDL levels.[137] Statin therapy
has been shown to only modestly reduce stroke recurrence after transient ischemic attack or ischemic
stroke. However, important reductions were seen in cardiovascular events.[138]
erectile dysfunction variable medium
Endothelial dysfunction is the underlying mechanism of erectile dysfunction, and oxidative stress is
associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein.[139] Nonpharmacologic intervention strategies
for reducing weight, improving quality of diet, and increasing physical activity can improve erectile function
in men at risk.[140]

Hypercholesterolemia Follow up
Prognosis
Since statins were introduced in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the rate of adverse outcomes has
been significantly reduced. Large-scale randomized clinical trial evidence shows that the vast majority of
patients do well with statin therapy without adverse events.[133] [134] Cases of myopathy and any muscle-
related symptoms associated with statin therapy generally resolve after discontinuation of treatment. If the
treatment plan includes detection and management of other factors that contribute to the development of
coronary heart disease (CHD), such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, the overall prognosis
of hypercholesterolemia is improved. Cholesterol reduction is useful as a CHD risk-reduction strategy and for
primary prevention in people who are at high risk for CHD or other forms of atherosclerosis.

Hypercholesterolemia Evidence tables
• Start statin treatment in people with CVD with high-dose atorvastatin ᶜ.  Use a lower dose of
atorvastatin if any of the following apply:
• potential drug interactions
• high risk of adverse effects
• patient preference.
Note
• Due to the reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction with high-intensity statin, the guideline group felt
this to be the most cost effective option.
• The guideline group noted a consistent higher rate of adverse events for high-intensity simvastatin
compared with other higher-intensity statins.
ᵃ  NICE defines statin intensities as follows:
Low intensity = LDL-cholesterol reduction of 20%–30%
Medium intensity = LDL-cholesterol reduction of 31%–40%
High intensity = greater than 40% LDL-cholesterol reduction
ᵇ  The source material for this table (table 46 in the full text document) includes subgroup analyses which
have not been listed here.

Hypercholesterolemia Evidence tables
• potential drug interactions
• high risk of adverse effects
• patient preference.
Note
• The guideline development group notes that the evaluation of individual outcomes may underestimate
the total clinical benefit of statins.
• The guideline compares many different intensities of statin. Overall, the guideline development group
felt the evidence (clinical and cost-effectiveness) for reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction was
best for high-intensity statins.
ᵃ  NICE defines statin intensities as follows:
Low intensity = LDL-cholesterol reduction of 20%–30%
Medium intensity = LDL-cholesterol reduction of 31%–40%
High intensity = greater than 40% LDL-cholesterol reduction
ᵇ  See guideline for their recommendation on starting dose of atorvastatin.
* Evidence levels
The Evidence level is an internal rating applied by BMJ Best Practice. See the EBM Toolkit (https://
bestpractice.bmj.com/info/evidence-tables/) for details.
Confidence in evidence
A -  High or moderate to high
B -  Moderate or low to moderate
C -  Very low or low
† Effectiveness (BMJ rating)
Based on statistical significance, which demonstrates that the results are unlikely to be due to chance, but
which does not necessarily translate to a clinical significance.
‡ Grade certainty ratings
High The authors are very confident that the true
effect is similar to the estimated effect.
Moderate The authors are moderately confident that
the true effect is likely to be close to the
estimated effect.
Low The authors have limited confidence in the
effect estimate and the true effect may be
substantially different.
Very Low The authors have very little confidence in
the effect estimate and the true effect is
likely to be substantially different.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
