Evaluation of clubbing Overview
Summary
• An important nail sign of systemic disease linked with underlying pulmonary, cardiovascular,
neoplastic, infectious, hepatobiliary, mediastinal, endocrine, and gastrointestinal disorders.
• Digital clubbing may also occur in isolation (e.g., familial clubbing, as an autosomal-dominant trait).
Definition
Clubbing is a bulbous uniform swelling of the soft tissue of the terminal phalanx of a digit with subsequent
loss of the normal angle between the nail and nail bed.
The first stage of clubbing is a periungual erythema and a softening of the nail bed; this is followed by an
increase in the Lovibond angle (the angle between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate). Eventually the
depth of the distal phalanx increases and the distal interphalangeal joint may become hyperextensible.[1] [2]
The Schamroth window test can be used to identify or confirm clubbing. If 2 opposing fingers are held back
to back against each other, a diamond-shaped space should normally appear between the nail beds and the
nails of the 2 fingers. In clubbing, this space (or window) is missing.

Clubbing is usually bilateral, although unilateral clubbing does exist (e.g., axillary artery aneurysm and
brachial arteriovenous malformations). It is painless unless associated with underlying conditions such
as pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The vast majority of patients are unaware of its presence.
However, an understanding of the causation and diseases associated with clubbing alerts the physician to
the seriousness of this sign and the need to investigate the patient appropriately.

Pathophysiology
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is key.[3] This platelet-derived factor is stimulated by hypoxia and
produced in diverse malignancies and conditions that affect circulation. VEGF induces vascular hyperplasia,
edema, and fibroblast or osteoblast proliferation at a peripheral level in the nails. In primary pulmonary
conditions such as lung cancer, this is the operative mechanism. When there is extrapulmonary shunting of
blood - for example, in cyanotic heart disease - large megakaryocytic fragments gain access to the systemic
circulation and affect distal sites such as the nails. Here, these fragments release growth factors, including
VEGF.[1] [4]
In cases of bronchogenic carcinoma, growth hormone has been implicated as a cause of clubbing. In
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, an additional unknown factor is considered necessary to produce this
syndrome; cyanosis may also be required.[5] [6] Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is characterized by abnormal
proliferation of skin and periosteal tissues involving the extremities and is clinically evident as digital clubbing,
periostosis of tubular bones, and synovial effusions.[7]
Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of clubbing.[2] [8] Platelets
release PDGF in the vasculature of the fingertips. Conditions that involve chronic platelet excess (e.g.,
inflammatory bowel disease) result in peripheral platelet trapping and release of PDGF.[5] PDGF stimulates
growth, vascular permeability, and monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis, and leads to proliferation of vascular
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, as is seen in clubbing.[5]
Clubbing may be stimulated by local arteriovenous anastomoses provoked by neurocirculatory stimuli.
Unilateral clubbing secondary to local disorders (e.g., axillary artery aneurysm) is not due to a pulmonary
circulation defect.[9] [10]

Evaluation of clubbing Theory
THEORY
Etiology
Clubbing may be acquired or present as a hereditary anomaly.
Pulmonary
Lung cancer
• Clubbing may be seen with any cell type of lung cancer.
• Most frequently associated with squamous and adenocarcinomas and least frequently with small cell
carcinoma.[11]
Bronchiectasis
• Disease process characterized by abnormally dilated bronchi with thickened bronchial walls.
• More common in middle-aged and older people; usually due to an infectious cause.
• Underlying conditions associated with bronchiectasis include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Kartagener
syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and diffuse panbronchiolitis.[12]
Lung abscess
• Risk factors include immunosuppression, poor oral hygiene, drug misuse, alcohol misuse, seizure
disorders, stroke, and lung cancer.
Empyema
• Most commonly results from untreated bacterial infection in the pleural space.
Pulmonary metastases
• Caused by a number of primary tumors (e.g., colorectal cancer, bone and soft-tissue sarcoma,
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, germ cell tumor).
Pulmonary tuberculosis
• Pooled prevalence of digital clubbing of 17.1% reported in children and adolescents with
tuberculosis.[13]
• Clubbing is not usually a feature of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) that occurs in isolation.
• Can occur in cavitating TB and in patients who have pulmonary TB with underlying HIV infection.
Cystic fibrosis (CF)
• Reported pooled prevalence of digital clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy of 19.5% and 5.0%,
respectively, in children and adolescents with CF.[13]
• CF is characterized by multiple organ system involvement, mainly resulting in chronic respiratory tract
infections and the effects of pancreatic enzyme insufficiency.
Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
• A group of conditions involving chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease of varying causes. May be
idiopathic.
• Pooled prevalence of digital clubbing of 31.3% reported in adults with interstitial lung diseases.[13]

Evaluation of clubbing Theory
• Characterized by dyspnea, reduced lung volumes, and poor gas exchange on lung function testing.[14]
[15]
• Digital clubbing has been associated with parameters of disease severity in patients with interstitial
lung disease.[16]
Sarcoidosis
• Chronic granulomatous disorder, characterized by accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages in
the lungs and other organs.
• Lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes are involved in >90% of patients, but virtually any organ can be
affected.[17]
Asbestosis
• Diffuse interstitial fibrosis of the lung as a consequence of chronic inhalation of asbestos fibers.[18]
• Occupational history is important, as the type of work performed usually indicates asbestos exposure
(shipyard, construction, maintenance, vehicle brakes, asbestos cement, and insulation or production of
tiles, shingles, gaskets, or textiles).
• May lead to a number of respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, pleural plaques, benign pleural
effusions, and malignant mesotheliomas.
• Risk of lung cancer increased in patients exposed to cigarette smoke.
Pleural mesothelioma
• Classified into 3 types based on thoracoscopic biopsy and cytology samples: epithelial, sarcomatoid,
and mixed.
• About 80% of patients have had occupational exposure to asbestos.[19]
Lipoid pneumonia
• Rare form of pneumonia that may be due to release of endogenous lipids in the lung (when lung tissue
breaks down distal to an obstruction, e.g., lung carcinoma, bronchiolitis obliterans, or following lung
necrosis after chemotherapy and radiation therapy) or caused by inhalation of exogenous lipids (e.g.,
aspiration of ingested oil, including mineral and vegetable oil).[20]
Pulmonary artery sarcoma
• Rare sarcoma arising from the intima of the pulmonary artery.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)
• Is the result of non-IgE mediated immunologic inflammation of the alveoli and distal bronchioles
caused by repeated inhalation of nonhuman protein, such as from plant, bacteria, or animal, or the
result of a chemical conjugated to a human airway protein, such as albumin.
• Clubbing occurs in approximately half of those with chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.[21] [22]
Cardiovascular
Congenital heart disease
• Clubbing is a common sign of cyanotic congenital heart disease (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet
right ventricle, transposition of great vessels).

THEORY
Nonpulmonary malignant
Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin disease)

Hereditary
Familial clubbing
• Clubbing without any associated signs or symptoms.
• Exact genetics undefined; most likely inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait.[27]
• Sometimes regarded as incomplete form of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA).[28] [29] [30]

Evaluation of clubbing Theory
THEORY
• Syndrome characterized by proliferative changes in the skin and skeleton. Rarely, may present as a
presumptive acute reactive arthritis.[35]
• Enlargement of the extremities due to periarticular and osseous proliferation as well as digital clubbing
are common.
• Associated with cardiopulmonary diseases and malignancies (e.g., lung cancer, lung abscess,
bronchiectasis, emphysema, Hodgkin lymphoma, metastatic disease, cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis,
inflammatory bowel disease, biliary atresia).
• Pooled prevalence of HOA of 10.1% in adults with cancers.[13]
• Presence of an underlying condition differentiates HOA from pachydermoperiostosis (considered
primary HOA), which does not require immediate attention or intervention.[36]
Palmoplantar keratoderma
• May be inherited (either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive) or acquired (due to changes in
an individual's health or environment).
• Characterized by an abnormal thickening of the palms and soles.
• Fischer syndrome and Volavsek syndrome (also called Buschke-Fischer-Brauer syndrome) are
considered variants of palmoplantar keratoderma.[37]
Pregnancy
• In rare cases, increased vascular demand of peripheries and hormonal factors can induce clubbing in
pregnancy.
Pseudoclubbing
• Lovibond angle (the angle made by the proximal nail fold and nail plate) between 160° and 180°
possibly reflects early stages of clubbing or a pseudoclubbing phenomenon.
• Unlike digital clubbing, there is no clear definition of pseudoclubbing.[38] In addition, there is no
convincing etiopathogenic mechanism for pseudoclubbing. Asymmetric finger involvement has been
observed in the majority of cases. Acro-osteolysis is also seen, but is not a discriminatory feature as it
also occurs in true clubbing.[38]
Myelofibrosis
• Reactive process common to many malignant and benign disorders.
• Clubbing has been described in myelofibrosis.[39]

Evaluation of clubbing Emergencies
Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
A number of conditions associated with clubbing require urgent evaluation and treatment.
Pulmonary
Lung cancer
• Emergency care may be necessary depending on the presentation.
• If the patient has upper airway obstruction, urgent admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is
required. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy or intraoperative tracheostomy may be necessary to help relieve the
obstruction.
• Sometimes patients present with severe hemoptysis. In such cases, immediate suctioning is indicated.
If respiratory failure is imminent, an endotracheal tube should be placed. The patient will require
an urgent blood transfusion, and a pulmonologist may have to perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy. All
patients, except those with the most minor bleed, need intensive care.
Empyema
• Respiratory failure can occur, requiring assisted ventilation in an ICU. Intubation may be necessary. If
pulse oximetry shows low saturation, supplemental oxygen should be started immediately.
Pulmonary metastases
• The extent and position of metastases are important considerations. Metastases impinging on major
airways or eroding into major intrathoracic vessels can result in massive hemoptysis and shock.
This risk, and possible management options, should be discussed with the patient. These patients
may require emergency management in an intensive care floor. Establishment of venous access,
transfusion of blood products, management of shock with fluids, and cardiosupportive measures are
usually the initial steps.
• A thoracic surgery team should be on standby for an emergency thoracotomy if indicated. For some
patients, a plan to palliate symptoms in the event of massive hemoptysis caused by metastases is
appropriate.
Pulmonary tuberculosis
• This is infectious and requires administration of antituberculous drugs immediately. The patient may
require respiratory isolation if there is open discharge of bacilli.
• Notification to appropriate healthcare agencies is mandatory.
Pleural mesothelioma
• Patients can present with a pleural effusion. All patients with rapidly collecting effusions need
evaluation in the emergency department. Urgent placement of an intercostal drain may be required.
Lipoid pneumonia
• Hypoxia and respiratory distress, although rare, can occur in severe cases. Urgent ventilatory support
is required.
Pulmonary artery sarcoma

Evaluation of clubbing Emergencies
EMERGENCIES
• Patients may present to the emergency department with a massive bleed, shock, and collapse.
Hemoptysis is a warning sign. Thoracotomy and intervention by a pulmonary care intensivist and
thoracic surgeon will be required.
Cardiovascular
Right-to-left shunting
• Infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle,
transposition of great vessels) or other causes of right-to-left shunting (e.g., patent ductus arteriosus
and coarctation of the aorta) may present with symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure.
Consult a pediatric cardiologist urgently.
• Pharmacologic therapy should be given promptly before surgical interventions are considered.
Infective endocarditis
• Patients may present to the emergency department with congestive heart failure or even renal failure
requiring urgent therapy and possibly dialysis.
Atrial myxoma
• This can occasionally cause a stroke due to embolization. In such cases, urgent medical attention is
required, as a successful outcome depends on rapid evaluation, diagnosis, and intervention.
Axillary artery aneurysm
• This can sometimes result in a pulmonary embolism. Fibrinolysis, heparin, oxygen, and intravenous
fluids may be required. In severe cases, emergency bypass is necessary.
Brachial arteriovenous malformations
• This may result in embolization, pain, or distal gangrene. Urgent admission, delineation of the
aneurysm and possible resection, or resolution of embolic episodes are required.
Hepatobiliary
Cirrhosis
• May result in the alteration of clotting parameters or varices causing an acute bleed, requiring urgent
sclerotherapy, transfusion, and endoscopic assistance. Deterioration of metabolic status can lead to
coma and hepatorenal failure, requiring intensive care.
Gastrointestinal
Ulcerative colitis
• Ulcers can occasionally cause severe hematochezia and rectal bleeding. These patients need an
emergency colonoscopy and sometimes resection of the affected bowel segment.
Crohn disease

Evaluation of clubbing Emergencies
• Intestinal obstruction can develop due to bowel wall thickening by acute inflammation. Presents with
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and dilated bowel loops and air-fluid levels on
x-ray.
• Treatment involves bowel rest with nasogastric suctioning and may require corticosteroid therapy.
Patients not responding to these measures require surgical resection.
Ulcerative esophagitis
• Patients can present with vomiting and hematemesis if the ulcer erodes into the wall of the esophagus.
Emergency assistance is required with esophagoscopy to arrest bleeding and possible transfusion of
blood products.
Nonpulmonary malignant
Disseminated chronic myeloid leukemia
• Advanced cases can occasionally alter the coagulation cascade and produce disseminated
intravascular coagulation. This requires urgent replacement with plasma and anticoagulant therapy
immediately after evaluation.
Other
Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy
• May be due to a sinister underlying cause (including adenocarcinoma of the lung, as well as other
malignancies including metastatic disease); thus, its presence should alert the physician to the need
for a thorough and urgent investigation.

Evaluation of clubbing Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
Clubbing is a bulbous uniform swelling of the soft tissue of the terminal phalanx of a digit, with subsequent
loss of the normal angle between the nail and the nail bed. It is usually bilateral, although unilateral clubbing
does exist.[30] It is a sign, rather than a condition. Once clubbing is identified, history and exam should focus
on identification of the underlying cause. 
History
A detailed history is necessary to exclude organic causes of clubbing.[29] [30]
Symptoms associated with pulmonary etiology
The presence of shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough (acute or chronic) on history taking usually
indicates an underlying pulmonary etiology. A cough may be a symptom of hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
congenital heart disease, thymus cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Production of purulent sputum is
particularly suggestive of lung abscess, empyema, or bronchiectasis. Hemoptysis may indicate underlying
lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), pulmonary artery sarcoma, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis,
bronchiectasis, lung abscess, or myelofibrosis. Smoking is considered a risk factor for lung cancer,
asbestosis, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.[40] Asbestos exposure is suggestive of asbestosis, lung
cancer, or pleural mesothelioma. A known TB contact, travel to an endemic area, and/or a history of
immunosuppression (particularly HIV infection) should arouse suspicion of cavitating pulmonary TB. A
history of mineral or vegetable oil ingestion (e.g., laxative use) in a patient with respiratory symptoms
supports a diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia.[41] [42]
Symptoms associated with cardiac etiology
Faltering growth in children, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, irritability, and recurrent lung infections, with or
without cyanosis, strongly suggest a cardiac etiology.
Adults who survive congenital heart disease may have symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea, peripheral
edema, and fatigue) or differential cyanosis (pink upper extremities and cyanotic lower extremities as can
occur in coarctation of the aorta).
Symptoms that may help to narrow the differential diagnosis
Abdominal pain may occur in cystic fibrosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, tropical sprue, or celiac
disease. Ulcerative esophagitis can present with epigastric pain. In addition, diarrhea may be a symptom of
both cystic fibrosis and celiac disease.
Fever often suggests an underlying infectious etiology such as pulmonary TB, infective endocarditis,
empyema, or lung abscess. Other conditions presenting with fever include pulmonary artery sarcoma,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Hodgkin lymphoma, disseminated chronic myeloid leukemia, atrial myxoma,
Crohn disease, and tropical sprue. When considering tropical sprue as an underlying cause, a history of
travel to endemic areas should be established.
Loss of weight is a fairly nonspecific symptom and may occur with pulmonary TB, ulcerative colitis,
Crohn disease, tropical sprue, malignancy, metastatic disease, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, chronic
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and achalasia.

Evaluation of clubbing Diagnosis
Generalized weakness is associated with most conditions, particularly TB, lung cancer, congenital heart
disease, inflammatory bowel disease, liver cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and
primary biliary cholangitis. Jaundice suggests underlying liver cirrhosis.
Night sweats are a common presenting symptom of pulmonary TB and Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with
infective endocarditis may also complain of night sweats.
Paresthesias may occur in association with lung metastases due to associated hypercalcemia,
paraproteinemia, or vasculitis. Arthralgia is a feature of pachydermoperiostosis, sarcoidosis, and infective
endocarditis.[31]
Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of early pregnancy and of ulcerative esophagitis. A history of dysphagia
should arouse suspicion of an esophageal condition such as achalasia or leiomyoma of the esophagus.
In thymus cancer almost one third of patients are asymptomatic. Chest pain, myasthenia gravis, cough, and
dyspnea may occur with equal frequency. Fatigue is common in thymoma, as are weakness and weight
loss.[43]
Patients with thyroid acropachy usually have a history of thyrotoxicosis (Graves disease, but it may also be
present in Hashimoto thyroiditis) and complain of related symptoms including heat intolerance, sweating,
weight loss, palpitations, scalp hair loss, or irritability.
Physical exam
Confirming the presence of clubbing
On clinical exam, in profile, the normal distal digit shows an angle made by the junction of the proximal nail
fold and nail plate (Lovibond angle) typically less than or equal to 160°. With clubbing this angle flattens, and
then rises as the severity of the clubbing increases. If the angle is >180°, definitive clubbing exists. An angle
between 160° and 180° possibly reflects early stages of clubbing or a pseudoclubbing phenomenon.

The Schamroth window test can be used to identify or confirm clubbing. If two opposing fingers are held back
to back against each other, a diamond-shaped space should normally appear between the nail beds and the
nails of the two fingers. In clubbing, this space (or window) is missing.

Examination for other clinical signs of the skin and nails
The following signs should be sought:[31] [44]  
• Thickened palms and soles suggestive of palmoplantar keratoderma
• Cutis verticis gyrata (thickened skin of the scalp manifesting as folds and furrows), associated with
various conditions such as acromegaly and pachydermoperiostosis
• Coarse skin indicative of acromegaly or pachydermoperiostosis
• Acne, which may be associated with pachydermoperiostosis
• Skin changes of liver disease including jaundice, spider nevi, and skin excoriations
• Pallor suggesting anemia (present in disseminated myeloid leukemia, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis,
celiac disease, tropical sprue, and infective endocarditis)
• Swellings that could indicate an aneurysm, such as axillary artery aneurysm and brachial
arteriovenous malformations
• Rashes, which may indicate a compromised immune state, such as underlying malignancy
• Erythema nodosum, which may be a feature of sarcoidosis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis
• Unilateral clubbing, which may indicate an axillary artery aneurysm or brachial arteriovenous
malformation.

Examination of other systems
A complete physical exam of the lungs should be undertaken, looking for signs suggestive of fluid collection
in the pleura (pleural effusion, empyema), consolidation, or collapse (pneumonia, TB). Pulmonary
malignancies, including metastatic lesions, may also present with signs suggestive of fluid collection,
consolidation, and/or collapse. Areas of hyperresonance on the lung fields and evidence of cavitation (TB) or
fibrosis (suggestive of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or cystic fibrosis)
should also be excluded.
A thorough cardiovascular exam should be performed to evaluate for signs suggestive of a right-to-left shunt
(cyanosis together with a cardiac murmur indicates cyanotic congenital heart disease), infective endocarditis
(cardiac murmur, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, splinter hemorrhages, Roth spots), and an atrial myxoma
(systolic murmur, loud first heart sound, opening snap, embolic manifestations).
Hepatomegaly may be present on abdominal exam, indicating an underlying malignancy or the early stages
of primary biliary cholangitis. Splenomegaly is almost always present in myelofibrosis. The presence of
splenomegaly and ascites suggests advanced liver disease. Epigastric tenderness may be due to ulcerative
esophagitis. Ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, tropical sprue, celiac disease, and cystic fibrosis can all
present with varying degrees of abdominal pain.

Evaluation of clubbing Diagnosis
Thyroid gland exam should focus on the presence of enlargement, nodules, and tenderness. This helps to
exclude endocrine conditions associated with clubbing such as thyroid acropachy.
Tender swollen joints may suggest pachydermoperiostosis or secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.[31]
[35] In addition to joint pain, patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism experience bone
tenderness.

Baseline investigations
Consider the following investigations when digital clubbing is identified.
• Complete blood count (CBC) with peripheral smear and erythrocyte sedimentation rate: useful when
an underlying infective or inflammatory cause, or malignancy is suspected. An CBC will show anemia
in myelofibrosis, and a peripheral blood smear will show teardrop-shaped red blood cells (RBCs) and
the presence of metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes, myeloblasts, and nucleated RBCs in the
circulation.
• Complete metabolic panel: necessary when evaluating for chronic illness (e.g., cystic fibrosis,
sarcoidosis, and liver disease). Liver function tests are requested if a hepatobiliary cause is suspected,
and thyroid function tests (serum free T3/total T3, serum free T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone
levels) are indicated if thyroid disease is suspected.
• Chest x-ray: to search for an underlying pulmonary condition.
• Blood cultures: when a possible infective etiology is suspected (e.g., lung abscess, infective
endocarditis).
• Urinalysis: may demonstrate active sediment (indicating septic emboli) in cases of infective
endocarditis.
Specific investigations
Further investigation is guided by the above results coupled with findings on physical exam and a suggestive
history.
Investigations for suspected respiratory cause
Sputum microscopy and culture, as well as cytology, should be requested where there is an underlying
pulmonary cause associated with clubbing. If history or clinical exam suggests pulmonary TB, three sputum
samples should be collected for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests
should be performed on at least one respiratory specimen.[45]

Evaluation of clubbing Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Spirometry helps assess lung function and often supports various pulmonary diagnoses, particularly
interstitial lung disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage is useful in confirming the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia
or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and may be indicated in difficult-to-prove cases of TB. A diagnostic
thoracentesis may be necessary when empyema or pleural mesothelioma is suspected.[46]
A chest computed tomography (CT) scan may be required to clarify or localize chest x-ray findings,
especially where a pulmonary malignancy is the concern. It can detect metastases and helps to diagnose
lymphoreticular malignancies such as Hodgkin lymphoma. High-resolution chest CT (HRCT) is the test of
choice when interstitial lung disease is suspected.[15] 
A magnetic resonance imaging scan is useful to localize lesions. It may be combined with angiography to
visualize the vascularity of the lesion or the relationship of the lesion to blood vessels.
A positron emission tomography scan is a useful investigation, especially when combined with CT scan for
accurate definition of lesions. It is particularly helpful in detecting lymphomas of the chest or body.
Once the site of the lesion has been identified, a confirmatory tissue diagnosis is desirable. This may be
achieved via bronchoscopy, aspiration techniques, tumor resection, or simple biopsy through endoscopy, all
depending on lesion location.
When cystic fibrosis is suspected a sweat test is performed. Gene analysis may be indicated if the sweat test
is inconclusive.
Investigations for suspected cardiac cause
When a structural heart defect is suspected transthoracic echocardiogram is usually the first test performed.
Transesophageal echocardiogram is considered a more sensitive assay to detect structural defects and
vegetations in infective endocarditis.[47] Cardiac catheterization is a specialized investigation, done to
confirm an echocardiogram finding or, rarely, to sample an intracardiac mass. It is also a useful tool to
measure pressure changes in the heart accurately. Intravascular ultrasonography is useful for preoperative
diagnosis of a pulmonary artery sarcoma. A final diagnosis is confirmed with histopathology following
surgery.
When an arteriovenous malformation is present, Doppler ultrasonography detects the flow across a shunt
and the direction of flow of blood in a vessel. This is considered especially helpful in delineating the origins
of an aneurysm. Angiography or magnetic resonance angiography is useful, particularly when planning
treatment of an arteriovenous anomaly.
Investigations for suspected heptic or gastrointestinal cause
The size and texture of the liver is easily assessed with ultrasonography and, therefore, this is usually one of
the initial tests ordered when evaluating liver disease, including cirrhosis.
Barium studies may be necessary when the underlying diagnosis is thought to be due to inflammatory
bowel disease or an esophageal abnormality. Colonoscopy is indicated when signs and symptoms suggest
inflammatory bowel disease. This technique also allows tissue sampling for histopathology, which further
confirms the diagnosis.
A prolonged prothrombin time is often associated with celiac disease or liver cirrhosis. Celiac disease may
also result in iron deficiency; thus, iron studies should be sent. Serum folate and B12 analysis is necessary
when tropical sprue is suspected, as malabsorption may reduce levels.

Evaluation of clubbing Diagnosis
A 72-hour fecal fat collection to assess for steatorrhea may assist in the diagnosis of tropical sprue (although
a 24-hour sample is more commonly obtained).
Investigations for suspected endocrine cause
When acromegaly is suspected, growth hormone levels, coupled with measurement of insulin growth factor
1, confirms the diagnosis. Levels of serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, and vitamin D are indicated when
the possibility of secondary hyperparathyroidism is a concern.
If thyroid cancer is suspected, thyroid ultrasonography helps determine the structure and nature of the thyroid
mass. A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the suspicious lesion may be performed under ultrasound guidance
for accurate tissue sampling. Cytology results confirm the diagnosis.
Investigations for suspected hematologic cause
Cytogenetic testing (e.g., fluorescent in situ hybridization) may be indicated in cases of disseminated chronic
myeloid leukemia. Determining lactate dehydrogenase level and immunohistochemical studies may be
necessary when evaluating for Hodgkin lymphoma.
Other potential investigations
Plain film radiographs of the hands and other joints may be helpful in confirming a diagnosis of secondary
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy or pachydermoperiostosis.[31]
Skin biopsy is rarely necessary. However, in some conditions it may help to establish a diagnosis, including
sarcoidosis, thyroid acropachy, and pachydermoperiostosis.[31]

normal in patients with
compensated cirrhosis;
as cirrhosis progresses,
serum levels generally
rise.
Values vary depending
on stage and extent of
cirrhosis.
»albumin: reduced
»prothrombin time:
prolonged
»liver biopsy:
architectural distortion
of liver parenchyma
with formation of
regenerative nodules
Liver biopsy remains
the most specific
and sensitive test for
diagnosis of cirrhosis,
but is not necessary in
patients with advanced
liver disease and typical
clinical, laboratory, and/
or radiologic findings of
cirrhosis, unless degree
of inflammation needs
to be determined.

Marker of hepatic
synthetic dysfunction.
»abdominal
ultrasound: early
stages: enlarged
smooth liver;
subsequently: coarse
echotexture; advanced
disease: small liver
with surface nodularity,
ascites, splenomegaly,
increased diameter of
portal vein (≥13 mm) or
collateral vessels
Stages of cirrhosis
can be monitored
on ultrasound. Early
intervention can arrest
disease progress.
In combination
with strong clinical
suspicion, the above
findings suffice for
diagnosis of cirrhosis
without need of
confirmatory liver
biopsy.

appears as a smooth
mass in upper half of
chest
Mass usually projects
into one of the
hemithoraces.
Most thymic cancers
are confirmed at time
of surgical resection.
Therefore, tests
ordered are to stage
the tumor and get a
histologic type and
prognostic bearing.[43]

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
