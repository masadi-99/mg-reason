Atrioventricular block Overview
Summary
Atrioventricular (AV) block can be described by degree (based on ECG appearance) or by anatomic level of
block.
The degree of AV block or anatomic level of block does not necessarily correlate with the severity of
subsequent symptoms.
The goals of therapy are to treat symptoms and to prevent syncope and sudden cardiac death due to very
slow or absent ventricular rates.
Patients with advanced AV block (usually type II second-degree, third-degree, or infranodal AV block) of
irreversible cause should undergo permanent pacemaker placement.
Definition
Atrioventricular (AV) block is a cardiac electrical disorder defined as impaired (delayed or absent) conduction
from the atria to the ventricles. The severity of the conduction abnormality is described in degrees: first-
degree; second-degree, type I (Wenckebach or Mobitz I) or type II (Mobitz II); and third-degree (complete)
AV block. This classification scheme should be applied only during sinus rhythm and not during rapid atrial
arrhythmias or to premature atrial beats.[1]

Atrioventricular block Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The epidemiology of AV block is not well characterized.[2] One study comparing the prevalence of first-
degree AV block in African-American and white patients found that first-degree AV block was more prevalent
in African-American patients in almost all decades of life (third through 10th).[3] In both groups, first-degree
AV block became more common at age 50 years and increased with advancing age, peaking in the 10th
decade for African-American patients and in the ninth decade for white patients. Another study examined 24-
hour Holter monitors in 625 asymptomatic, heart-disease-free people, ages 15 to 83 years.[4] Transient type
I second-degree AV block was seen in 14 (2.2%) patients, and was seen more frequently in patients with
resting heart rates of <60 bpm. In a large cross-sectional study involving 10,926 Chinese participants ages
≥40 years, prevalence of first-degree AV block was found to be 3.4%.[5] In another large population based
cohort study of 6146 participants from the MiniFinland Health Survey, 0.9% developed AV block in the course
of 20 years.[6] First-degree AV block has been associated with about a 2-fold increase in the probability of
atrial fibrillation, a 3-fold increase in the probability of pacemaker implantation, and an increase in all-cause
mortality.[2] [7]
Advanced AV block (usually type II second-degree and third-degree) is usually anatomically infranodal and
is seen in advanced His-Purkinje disease. One study examined the prevalence of His-Purkinje disease in the
Framingham population.[8] Here, QRS intervals of >0.12 seconds were significantly associated with coronary
heart disease, congestive heart failure, AV block, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular
extrasystoles. QRS intervals >0.12 seconds were rare before 50 to 60 years of age and were found in 11%
of older men and 5% of older women. While intraventricular block does not inevitably lead to AV block, it
frequently precedes the development of advanced AV block. Thus, this characterization of a wide-QRS
interval population is likely similar to that of the advanced AV block population.

Etiology
Causes include fibrosis and calcification of the conduction system, coronary artery disease (including
patients with a chronic disease and/or an acute coronary syndrome), and medication such as AV-nodal
blocking agents (i.e., beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digitalis, adenosine), antiarrhythmic
medications such as sodium-channel blockers, and some class III agents (i.e., sotalol and amiodarone).[1]
[9][10] Additional etiologies include high vagal tone; cardiomyopathy (e.g., hypertrophic, sarcoid, amyloid,

hemochromatosis); calcification from adjacent valves; catheter ablation for arrhythmias; cardiac surgery,
such as valve repair or replacement, myectomy, or following interventions such as septal ethanol ablation or
transcatheter aortic valve insertion; blunt cardiac injury; and some indigenous medicines.[11] [12] [13] Severe
electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, or hypoxemia may result in AV block as well as neuromuscular disorders
(myotonic dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb dystrophy, peroneal muscular atrophy), myocarditis,
infective endocarditis, cardiac tuberculosis, and Lyme disease. AV block may be congenital or associated
with complex congenital heart diseases, e.g., atrial septal defects, atrioventricular cushion defects and
selected cyanotic congenital heart diseases.[14] [15] Inherited progressive cardiac conduction disease in
structurally normal hearts in individuals less than 50 years of age is also now well recognized. In one study of
patients in Denmark ages <50 years with AV block, the etiology was unknown in 50.3% of patients.[16]
Pathophysiology
Block at the level of the AV node manifesting as first-degree or type I second-degree AV block is usually a
function of either high vagal tone or medication. High vagal tone is due to either a tonic elevation (e.g., in
younger, athletic patients) or transient vagotonia, as in neurocardiogenic syncope, sleep, nausea, vomiting,
or gagging.[17] Transient vagotonia may also result from endotracheal suctioning, micturition or bowel
movements, prolonged paroxysms of coughing or other instances of Valsalva, or inferior ischemia or
infarction. AV-nodal blocking agents are most commonly beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digitalis,
and adenosine. AV block is particularly common when these drugs are used in combination (e.g., digitalis or
beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers).
Block in the His-Purkinje system is usually manifested as type II second-degree AV block or third-degree
AV block. His-Purkinje system disease (usually seen as a widened QRS or bundle-branch block on a 12-
lead ECG) is usually due to an irreversible structural abnormality that is extensive enough to compromise AV
conduction. Because the His-Purkinje system conducts in an all or nothing fashion, AV block at this level will
manifest as a consistent PR interval followed by a nonconducted P wave (type II second-degree AV block) or
as complete heart block.
Classification
Degrees of block[1]
There are 2 commonly accepted clinical classification systems in use that are not formal classification
systems: degrees of block versus anatomic sites of block.

Case history
Case history #1
A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his primary care physician with 1 episode
of dizziness while watching television. On physical exam, his heart rate is measured at about 40 bpm. A
12-lead ECG is obtained showing sinus rhythm at about 75 bpm and complete heart block with a wide
escape rhythm at about 40 bpm.

Other presentations
The degree of AV block and the severity of symptoms are not necessarily directly related. For
example, patients with complete (third-degree) AV block may be minimally symptomatic or completely
asymptomatic. Ultimately, these patients may be diagnosed incidentally on undergoing an evaluation for
other reasons. On the other hand, patients with type I second-degree AV block may be very symptomatic,
presenting with syncope or presyncope due to very slow ventricular rates. AV block may also occur
in the setting of other acute illnesses such as an acute coronary syndrome, severe electrolyte or pH
disturbances, or severe hypoxemia. AV block of any degree may also occur in postcardiac surgery
patients and in patients with Lyme disease.

Atrioventricular block Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
The diagnosis of AV block can be made from any interpretable cardiac rhythm tracing such as a 12-lead
ECG, a cardiac telemetry rhythm strip, a Holter-monitor rhythm strip, or an event monitor strip.
History
Patients tend to be male and >50 to 60 years old. Underlying cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary
artery disease or an acute coronary syndrome; hypertension, congestive heart failure; left ventricular
hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy; or recent cardiac surgery) may be evident. Other strong risk factors
are acid-base disturbance or neuromuscular disease. Infrequently, patients may have a family history
of AV block as well. Rarely, Lyme disease is linked to AV block; as a potentially reversible cause, it is
important to identify. Clinical evidence of cardiac involvement occurs in 5% of patients with sarcoidosis,
although subclinical disease is more often encountered at autopsy. AV block can occur as a result of
granulomatous involvement of the interventricular septum or the conduction system. Such patients usually
present with syncope at an earlier age than AV block due to other etiologies.[27] Symptoms associated
with AV block are fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, and nausea and vomiting. Syncope and
presyncope are less commonly associated symptoms most often encountered in emergency care
settings.
Physical examination
On examination, patients often have a slow heart rate. If <40 bpm, hospital admission is warranted for
pacemaker implantation or temporary transvenous pacing. Blood pressure measurement is crucial.
Most often, blood pressure is high with a wide pulse pressure. If blood pressure is low, often ventricular
rates are very low (<40 bpm). Low blood pressure is usually seen in an emergency care setting. On
examination of jugular venous pressure, if cannon A waves are identified, an irreversible and complete
heart block may be present.
Laboratory tests
A 12-lead ECG is essential to identify the type and severity of AV block. It is performed first, and the
length and position of the PR interval is key in determining the degree of heart block. Evidence of
ischemia, a potential cause of AV block, is also determined on ECG. Serum troponin is drawn initially
to verify and track ischemia. CK-MB may be indicated in selected patients. Also drawn immediately are
serum potassium, calcium, and digitalis levels, and serum pH, which may identify possible reversible
causes of AV block. If a patient may have been exposed to Lyme disease, a serologic test is warranted to
rule out this reversible cause of AV block.
Cardiac tracing interpretation
The diagnostic criteria are based on measurement of the PR interval and the presence or absence of
nonconducted atrial impulses (no QRS following a P wave). The definitions of the various degrees of
block are as follows.
• First-degree AV block is fixed prolongation of the PR interval >0.2 seconds (or >200 milliseconds).

beating. The first sinus beat, following resumption of AV conduction, is conducted with a normal PR
interval.

• The term high-grade AV block is applied to a pattern where ≥2 sinus P waves block consecutively
in the context of periodic AV conduction.
Categorizing 2:1 AV block
One scenario in which the degree of block may be difficult to determine is that of 2:1 AV block. In this
case, it is impossible to determine the behavior of the PR interval, whether it progressively prolongs or
stays fixed before the nonconducted P wave (absent QRS). Thus, it is difficult to determine the anatomic
location of the second-degree AV block: nodal or infranodal. This distinction is important, as the 2
locations imply distinct pathophysiologic processes and prognoses: benign versus potentially malignant,
respectively.
Nodal second-degree AV block is suggested during 2:1 AV block when the following feature is present.
• Narrow QRS interval: this suggests the His-Purkinje system is intact and thus the level of block is
occurring at the level of the AV node.
• Up to 30% of infranodal block, however, may be associated with a narrow QRS interval.[34]
Presence of high vagal tone causing AV block is suspected from the following clinical and ECG features.
• A slow sinus rate.
• Long PR interval with conducted P waves.
• Episodes of 2:1 AV block occurring in the following settings: sleep; episodes of nausea, vomiting,
or gagging (i.e., endotracheal suctioning); pain; micturition or bowel movements; paroxysmal
coughing; or other instances of Valsalva (such as extreme straining to sit up).
• Improved frequency of conducted P waves with atropine (with measurable increase in the sinus
rate). Caution: giving atropine to patients with infranodal block (usually those with widened QRS
complexes at baseline) may worsen the degree of AV block and markedly decrease the ventricular

rate. Hence, before giving atropine, consultation with a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist
should be considered.
• Improved frequency of conducted P waves with exercise (walking around or leg lifts in bed with
demonstrable increase in the sinus rate).
Infranodal second-degree AV block is suggested during 2:1 AV block when the following features are
present.
• Widened QRS interval: this suggests intrinsic disease in the His-Purkinje system. However, up to
30% of infranodal block may be associated with a narrow QRS interval.[34]
• Worsened frequency of conducted P waves with exercise (walking around or leg lifts in bed with
demonstrable increase in the sinus rate) or with atropine: the His-Purkinje system can demonstrate
a fatigue phenomenon with more frequent stimulation (i.e., the higher the sinus rate, the more
frequently the His-Purkinje system is stimulated and the worse the frequency of conduction
becomes).

Ambulatory ECG monitoring, imaging, and other tests
A chest x-ray may be helpful in identifying or supporting possible causes of AV block, such as structural
heart disease or CHF. A transthoracic echocardiogram aids in identifying or quantifying structural heart
disease. This test is necessary if a permanent pacemaker is considered possible. 24-hour ambulatory
monitoring may be helpful in identifying AV block when such a heart block is suspected. An external
loop recorder may be used for 2-4 weeks for more frequent symptoms. An implantable loop recording
is useful if the 24-hour ambulatory monitoring does not detect AV block, but AV block is still suspected
due to symptoms and signs; implantable loop recorders may be used for up to 3 years for less frequent
symptoms or unexplained syncope. If AV block is thought to occur as a result of neurocardiogenic
syncope, tilt-table testing is suggested. If the severity of AV block is unknown and the need for a
pacemaker is still unclear, an electrophysiology study may help identify the AV block. Cardiac stress
testing is warranted when cardiac ischemia or exercise-induced AV block is likely. Especially in the setting
of an acute coronary syndrome and cardiac ischemia, coronary angiography will help identify obstructive
lesions, which, when treated, may help in reversing heart block.

Atrioventricular block Diagnosis
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
age >50-60 years (common)
• Any degree of heart block becomes more common with increasing age, especially >50-60 years.[3] [4]
[8]
underlying cardiovascular factors (common)
• Strong risk factors for AV block include increased vagal tone; use of AV nodal blocking agents;
underlying cardiovascular disease (e.g., CAD or an acute coronary syndrome; HTN, CHF; LVH or
cardiomyopathy); neuromuscular disorders; or recent cardiac surgery.
syncope (common)
• Syncope potentially implies a profound decrease in the ventricular rate, such as with the sudden
development of complete heart block with a slow or absent ventricular escape rhythm. More urgent
timing of pacemaker placement may be indicated. For example, syncope in a patient with high-degree
AV block (Stokes-Adams attack) is usually an indication for prompt pacemaker placement unless a
reversible cause, such as an inferior infarction or severe electrolyte or pH disturbances, is identified.
Thus, supportive care may avert the need for permanent pacing.
heart rate <40 bpm (common)
• The overall ventricular rate helps determine appropriate timing and level of therapy. With very slow
ventricular rates (<40 bpm), hospital admission and either urgent permanent pacemaker implantation
or temporary transvenous pacing should be considered.
presyncope (uncommon)
• Presyncope potentially implies a significant decrease in the ventricular rate and would prompt more
urgent timing of pacemaker placement, if indicated.
Other diagnostic factors
male gender (common)
• In one study of His-Purkinje disease, men were twice as likely as women to have a widened QRS
interval, a precursor to advanced degrees of heart block.[8]
fatigue (common)
• Fatigue, especially related to exertion, may be a function of a relatively slow ventricular rate. Because
fatigue is such a nonspecific symptom, its onset and duration should be correlated to that of the heart
block as much as possible. Exercise testing to evaluate the dynamic heart rate response may also be
helpful in establishing the contribution of bradycardia to fatigue or dyspnea.

Atrioventricular block Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
dyspnea (common)
• Dyspnea, especially related to exertion, may be a function of a relatively slow ventricular rate.
Similarly to fatigue, because dyspnea is such a nonspecific symptom, its onset and duration should be
correlated to that of the heart block as much as possible.
• This symptom is of concern for an acute coronary syndrome in those with new-onset heart block. The
acute coronary syndrome can be a proximate and reversible cause of heart block.
chest pain, palpitations, and nausea or vomiting (common)
• Of concern for an acute coronary syndrome in those with new-onset heart block. Chest pain,
palpitations, nausea, and vomiting are often encountered in patients with AV block in the acute setting.
Acute coronary syndrome can be a proximate and reversible cause of acute heart block.
high (less commonly, low) blood pressure (common)
• Slow ventricular rates with significant heart block are usually associated with elevated systolic blood
pressures and relatively wide pulse pressures, rather than with hypotension. Low blood pressures in
patients with heart block usually reflect significantly decreased ventricular rates (<40 bpm).
cannon A waves (common)
• The presence of structural heart disease is associated with His-Purkinje disease and may imply
an irreversible cause for heart block.[8] Examination of the jugular venous pressure may reveal
cannon A waves that may indicate the presence of AV dissociation due to complete heart block. The
intermittently prominent (cannon) A waves reflect the contraction of the right atrium against a closed
tricuspid valve.
hypoxemia (uncommon)
• Profound hypoxemia may be a reversible cause of heart block.
family history#of AV block (uncommon)
• Some causes of heart block have been shown to be hereditary.[14] Fetal third-degree AV block is
known to occur in the setting of maternal SLE.
features of Lyme disease (uncommon)
• Lyme disease is an uncommon cause of AV block, although there are regions where the disease is
endemic and should be considered more readily.[33] As a potentially reversible cause, its presence
should be considered, especially in younger patients presenting with exposure in these endemic
areas. The diagnosis is a clinical one, with presenting symptoms including headache, stiff neck,
fever, muscle and joint aches, fatigue, and erythema migrans. Even in patients diagnosed with Lyme
disease, the incidence of heart block is low (<2%).
Risk factors
Strong
age-related degenerative changes in the conduction system
• Usually take the form of either Lenegre disease (progressive fibrosis and sclerodegenerative changes)
or Lev disease (fibrosis or calcification of the conduction system extending from adjacent fibrous

structures of, usually, the aortic and/or mitral valves).[14] [18] [19] These degenerative changes may
account for up to half of the cases of complete heart block.[20]
increased vagal tone
• Increased vagal tone may be due to either a tonic high level of vagal tone or transient vagotonia. High
tonic vagal tone is found in younger, athletic patients or in patients with autonomic dysfunction.
• Transient vagotonia occurs in vasodepressor syncope; during sleep; during episodes of nausea,
vomiting, or gagging (i.e., endotracheal suctioning); during pain (including postoperatively), micturition,
or bowel movements; during paroxysmal coughing or other instances of Valsalva (such as extreme
straining to sit up); and during carotid sinus stimulation or cardiac ischemia. Excessive vagotonia
can also occur in patients with carotid sinus hypersensitivity, particularly common in older patients or
in patients who have undergone head and neck surgery or radiation. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
usually manifests as severe high-degree AV block precipitated by changes in head position or in
response to neck pressure.
AV-nodal blocking agents
• Most commonly implicated agents are AV-nodal blocking medications such as beta-blockers, calcium-
channel blockers, digitalis, and adenosine. Antiarrhythmic medications, including some sodium-
channel blockers and some class III agents (sotalol and amiodarone), may also cause AV block.[10]
chronic stable#coronary artery disease
• The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities has been shown to be associated with His-Purkinje
disease, a precursor to advanced degrees of heart block.[8] Presumably, this is due to an acceleration
of the process of degenerative fibrosis and calcification of the conduction system.
• AV block can be seen in the setting of chronic ischemic heart disease or as a complication of acute MI.
acute coronary syndrome
• In this setting, AV block can be as a result of imbalance in autonomic tone, ischemia, or necrosis
of the conduction system. It can complicate both anterior and inferior wall MI, typically being an
adverse prognostic factor when seen with the former and more often reversible with the latter. Primary
percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of acute MI has decreased the incidence of AV
block in the acute setting.[21]
• In one older study of 134 acute MI patients, first-degree AV block was seen in 11.8% of patients,
second-degree AV block in 4.8%, and complete heart block in 5.9%.[22] These percentages are
probably lower in the modern era of early reperfusion therapy for acute MI. One more recent study of
14,096 acute coronary syndrome patients identified high-degree AV block in only 1% of patients.[23]
Still, AV block remains a real and potentially serious complication of acute MI.
• The incidence of complete heart block in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is 1.0% to 3.7% based
on anterior or posterior/inferior location, respectively.[24] High-grade AV block after inferior NSTEMI
is usually transient, with a narrow QRS complex and a junctional escape rhythm.[25] High-degree
AV block in anterior NSTEMI is more ominous because of a greater extent of myocardial injury and
involvement of the conduction system.
recent cardiac surgery, intervention, or ablation
• May present a reversible cause for heart block.
• In one study of patients in Denmark ages <50 years with AV block, complications of cardiac surgery
was found to be the most common cause of AV blocks, accounting for 15.3% of all cases. Other

ablations.[16]
congestive heart failure (CHF)
• The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities has been shown to be associated with His-Purkinje
disease, a precursor to advanced degrees of heart block.[8] Presumably, this is due to an acceleration
of the process of degenerative fibrosis and calcification of the conduction system.
• Progression of left ventricular systolic dysfunction to CHF is associated with gradual prolongation of
the PR interval and intraventricular conduction disturbances, usually left bundle-branch block, in up to
about one third of patients.
hypertension
• The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities has been shown to be associated with His-Purkinje
disease, a precursor to advanced degrees of heart block.[8] Presumably, this is due to an acceleration
of the process of degenerative fibrosis and calcification of the conduction system. In one cohort
study, every 10 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure was associated with a 22% higher risk of
developing AV block.[6]
cardiomyopathy
• The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities has been shown to be associated with His-Purkinje
disease, a precursor to advanced degrees of heart block.[8] Presumably, this is due to an acceleration
of the process of degenerative fibrosis and calcification of the conduction system.
left ventricular hypertrophy
• The presence of cardiovascular comorbidities has been shown to be associated with His-Purkinje
disease, a precursor to advanced degrees of heart block.[8] Presumably, this is due to an acceleration

acid-base or electrolyte disturbance
• Severe electrolyte disturbance or acidosis may result in AV block.
neuromuscular disorders
• For example, myotonic dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb dystrophy, or peroneal muscular
atrophy.
sarcoidosis
• The true prevalence of cardiac sarcoidosis remains unknown and is potentially underestimated
since many individuals with cardiac sarcoidosis may have nonspecific symptoms or subclinical
disease.[26] AV block can occur as a result of granulomatous involvement of the interventricular
septum or the conduction system. Such patients usually present with syncope at an earlier age than
AV block due to other etiologies. AV block requiring permanent pacemaker is the most common
initial manifestation of cardiac sarcoidosis. One-fourth of unexplained AV block in adults ages <55
years are caused by cardiac sarcoidosis.[26] [27] The risk of sudden cardiac death is significant in
cardiac sarcoidosis presenting with high-grade AV block with or without ventricular tachycardia or
LV dysfunction.[28] Data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2012-2014 found that
sarcoidosis was associated with increased risk of complete heart block.[29]

• Diagnosis of the various degrees of AV block is frequently made
incidental to the workup for any number of presenting conditions.
• Symptoms specifically suggestive of AV block prompting a 12-lead
ECG include syncope, presyncope, episodic lightheadedness, and
progressive exertional fatigue and/or dyspnea. The 12-lead ECG
should also be inspected for evidence of acute ischemia (such as
ST-segment changes), which may point to a reversible cause of AV

Other tests to consider
Test Result
24-hour ambulatory monitoring or event monitoring
• 24-hour ambulatory monitoring may be helpful in identifying AV block
when such a heart block is suspected. An external loop recorder may
be used for 2-4 weeks for more frequent symptoms. An implantable
loop recording is useful if the 24-hour ambulatory monitoring does not
detect AV block, but AV block is still suspected due to symptoms and
signs; implantable loop recorders may be used for up to 3 years for
less frequent symptoms or unexplained syncope.
evidence of AV block
chest x-ray
• Evidence of structural heart disease (e.g., cardiomegaly, or
coronary or valvular calcification) or CHF may be present. Hilar
lymphadenopathy suggests sarcoidosis. Any number of pulmonary
findings may explain hypoxemia, leading to reversible AV block.
• There are numerous reasons for a chest radiograph to be ordered,
such as the presence of cardiopulmonary symptoms or a high clinical
suspicion for heart or lung disease.

cardiomegaly, coronary

transthoracic echocardiogram
• In the setting of advanced heart block, especially if permanent
pacemaker placement is considered, a transthoracic echocardiogram
should be ordered. The test can demonstrate the presence or
absence of structural heart disease and quantify left ventricular
systolic function (if ≤35%, biventricular pacemaker with or without
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD] placement should be
considered).

serologic testing for Lyme disease
• This test should be ordered when the clinical suspicion is high
(history, signs, and symptoms support the diagnosis). Because it is
a potentially reversible cause, Lyme disease should be considered,
especially in younger patients presenting with exposure to endemic
areas.

antibody titer
tilt-table testing
• This test can be ordered when AV block is thought to occur in the
setting of neurocardiogenic syncope. Neurocardiogenic syncope is
a clinical diagnosis, based on patient history, and the sensitivity and
specificity of tilt-table testing are widely ranging (30% to 80% and
50% to 90%, respectively).[35]
evidence of AV block
electrophysiology study
• This test should be ordered when the severity of conduction disease
and the possible need for treatment with a pacemaker are unclear,
such as with 2:1 AV block. Significant infranodal conduction disease

cause of AV block. It can also identify patients with vagotonia who
retain chronotropic competence (the ability to appropriately increase

Differentiating tests
Junctional rhythm • In patients with profound
first-degree AV block and
very long PR intervals,
the P wave may encroach
so closely on the QRS
complexes that they appear
to be retrograde P waves,
suggesting junctional rhythm.
Retrograde P waves in
junctional rhythm should be
inverted in the inferior leads
(II, III, and aVF), whereas in
sinus rhythm with profound
first-degree AV block, the P
waves are upright in those
leads.
• Comparison of numerous
ECGs obtained at different
times (i.e., days or months
apart) may be useful.
Baseline ECGs showing
profound first-degree AV
block may also help make
the diagnosis.
Supraventricular
tachycardia (SVT)
• In patients with profound
first-degree AV block and
very long PR intervals,
the P wave may encroach
so closely on the QRS
complexes that they
appear to be retrograde P
waves, suggesting SVT.
Retrograde P waves in SVT
are frequently inverted in the
inferior leads versus upright
in sinus rhythm with first-
degree AV block.
• Variations in the heart rate
and the PR and RP (QRS
to P) intervals suggest
against the diagnosis of SVT.
Comparison of numerous
ECGs may be very useful.
Atrial fibrillation
or multifocal atrial
tachycardia (MAT)
• The irregularity of the RR
intervals in type I second-
degree AV block may lead
to the incorrect diagnosis
of atrial fibrillation or MAT.
The presence of distinct
P waves and the grouped
pattern of the RR intervals
are characteristic of type
I second-degree AV block
and are not seen in atrial
fibrillation or MAT.
• Careful inspection of the
ECG should allow distinction
between these diagnoses.
Sinus rhythm with intact
AV conduction
• In patients with third-degree
AV block, if the rate of the
junctional escape rhythm is
similar to that of the sinus
rate, an appearance of
sinus rhythm with intact AV
conduction may be possible.

Atrioventricular block Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The goals of treatment are to ameliorate symptoms caused by AV block (regardless of degree) and to
prevent syncope and sudden cardiac death (in advanced AV block).
Asymptomatic: first-degree AV block or type I second-degree heart
block
No specific treatment is required. Patients are at low risk for progression to higher-degree AV block. ECGs
may be rechecked if symptoms develop, but do not need to be rechecked on a routine basis.
Symptomatic: first-degree AV block or type I second-degree heart
block
Occasionally, patients with profound first-degree AV block (>300 milliseconds) or those with type I
second-degree heart block will develop associated symptoms and should be treated. The first line of
treatment is to stop all AV-nodal blocking medications. The most common medications include beta-
blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, and digitalis. While discontinuing these medicines
may improve AV conduction, they are not likely to completely reverse a clinically significant AV block.
If symptoms are severe enough, permanent pacemaker implantation should be considered. For AV
block, usually a dual-chamber (1 right atrial and 1 right ventricular lead) pacemaker is placed. The entire
procedure usually takes a few hours and requires an overnight hospital stay. Biventricular pacemaker
with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement may be considered when the left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ≤35%.[38] [39] [40]
Asymptomatic or mildly to moderately symptomatic: type II
second-degree AV block or third-degree AV block
Medications blocking the AV node should be stopped first. Also, condition-specific management should
ensue, which should help treat any potentially reversible conditions causing AV-nodal blockade. This
includes treating acute coronary syndrome (i.e., antiplatelet medications, urgent revascularization) and
medication toxicity (e.g., glucagon for beta-blocker toxicity, calcium for calcium-channel toxicity, or digoxin
antibody for digitalis toxicity). When present, electrolyte or pH disturbances and hypoxemia should be
treated appropriately.
These patients are at risk for progression to slower ventricular rates and development or worsening
of symptoms.[41] In the absence of a reversible cause, these patients should undergo permanent
pacemaker implantation. ICD placement may be considered when the LVEF is ≤35%. In patients with
high-degree or complete heart block and LVEF of 36% to 50%, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)
may reduce total mortality and hospitalizations, and improve symptoms and quality of life (QOL).[42]
Severely symptomatic: type II second-degree AV block or third-
degree AV block
As with asymptomatic or mildly to moderately symptomatic patients, those with severely symptomatic
type II second-degree AV block or third-degree AV block (of irreversible cause) should receive aggressive
supportive therapy, condition-specific management, and discontinuation of all AV-nodal blocking
medications. Temporary pacing is used specifically with these types of AV block. Severe symptoms
include syncope or persistent, severe lightheadedness indicating profound decreases in the ventricular
rate. Transvenous pacing is much more reliable than transcutaneous pacing and should be performed by

a cardiologist when the heart block leads to hemodynamic instability. If the condition does not improve,
permanent pacemaker or ICD placement should be performed. In patients with high-degree or complete
heart block and LVEF of 36% to 50%, CRT may reduce total mortality and hospitalizations, and improve
symptoms and QOL.[42]
Considerations for causative medications
While discontinuing AV-nodal blocking medications (i.e., beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers, and digitalis) may improve AV conduction, complete reversal of clinically significant AV
block is an unlikely result. This modest effect should be weighed in the long term against the potential
medication benefit, such as the mortality benefit of beta-blockers in patients with CAD or salutary effects
on blood pressure and heart rate.

Atrioventricular block Management
Emerging
Alternative pacing sites
Traditionally, pacing in the right ventricle has always been undertaken from the apex, a site affording easy
accessibility and good lead stability. Alternative pacing sites such as the right ventricular outflow tract septum
or the mid-septum have been explored to provide more physiological pacing. However, the clinical benefit of
such sites remains uncertain, with variability in lead positioning increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. A
septal position may be preferable in patients at increased risk of perforation, such as elderly patients with a
low BMI, and women.[21]
Biologic pacemakers
Viral vectors, human embryonic stem cells, and adult human mesenchymal cells have been used to provide
biologic pacemaking.[43] This therapy is highly experimental and has been performed only in animals, but
holds promise for possible therapy in humans in the future.[44]
Leadless pacemakers
Pacemaker lead complications and failures remain significant clinical problems. Lead extraction for lead
malfunction is associated with significant morbidity and can be fatal in a small percentage of cases. Hence,
leadless device technology is appealing. The use of automatic generating systems[45] and ultrasound
energy as power sources[46] [47] [48] is being explored in animals and humans. It remains largely
experimental. The first of such devices has been implanted in humans in Europe and the US. In one
multicentre study, a leadless pacemaker was successfully implanted in 504 of the 526 patients.[49] The
pacemakers met pre-specified pacing and sensing requirements in the majority of patients, with device-
related serious adverse events occurring in approximately 1 in 15 patients.
Primary prevention
Primary prevention measures include avoiding circumstances that increase vagal tone when possible,
withdrawing or decreasing the dose of AV-nodal blocking agents, controlling chronic cardiovascular
diseases, and aggressively treating the acute coronary syndrome by restoring blood flow. During procedures,
reassurance and avoidance of pain also reduce vagally mediated bradycardia and heart block.
Secondary prevention
Control of chronic cardiovascular conditions can potentially be of some benefit. Statins have not shown
to be beneficial in prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with AV block and a permanent pacemaker
implantation.[54]
Patient discussions
Patients should be instructed to monitor and alert their physician concerning symptoms such as dizziness,
exertional dyspnea, syncope/transient loss of consciousness, fatigue, and any signs and symptoms
of CHF. Patients should also be advised of their prognosis in order to maintain an appropriate level of
concern.

Atrioventricular block Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients with asymptomatic AV block not requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (i.e., asymptomatic
first-degree AV block or type I second-degree AV block) can be followed expectantly for the development
of symptoms such as syncope, episodic presyncope, exertional dyspnea or fatigue, or CHF. Repeat ECG
recordings can be obtained if symptoms occur. These patients, especially in the setting of a narrow QRS
interval, are at low risk for progressing to more advanced degrees of AV block.
Patients with symptomatic, irreversible AV block or irreversible advanced AV block should be considered
for permanent pacemaker implantation. Patients who undergo permanent pacemaker implantation should
have routine follow-up and monitoring in a device clinic.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
pacemaker implantation sequelae variable low
In the short term, periprocedurally, the risks associated with pacemaker implantation are low: in the range
of 2% to 3%. These include bleeding, infection, vascular trauma, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, lead
dislodgement, and pocket hematoma development. The risk of MI, stroke, and death is <1%.
Long-term complications include pulse generator or lead malfunction and infection. The pulse generators
run on batteries that average 7 to 10 years in longevity. Battery depletion requires replacing the pulse
generator.
Over a lifetime, there is some risk of infection of the lead, which may require extraction, a complex
procedure that should be performed at specialized centers.
Prognosis
The prognosis is related to the degree of AV block and the severity of associated symptoms. In certain
conditions, such as sarcoid or amyloid heart disease or acute anterior MI, the underlying condition strongly
determines prognosis.
Nonrandomized studies strongly suggest that permanent pacing improves survival in patients with
third-degree AV block, especially if syncope has occurred. In patients with type II second degree AV
block, especially when the block is infranodal or the QRS is wide, prognosis is compromised. Mortality
remains high in patients with acute myocardial infarction in whom AV block occurs, as it reflects extensive
myocardial damage. AV block occurring with inferior MI, rather than an anterior MI, is more likely to resolve.
Registry data indicate that symptomatic cardiac sarcoidosis with heart block, ventricular arrhythmias, or
LV dysfunction is associated with a poor prognosis.[9] Along with the presence of concurrent myeloma,
presence and severity of cardiac involvement in primary amyloidosis determines prognosis.[53]

Atrioventricular block Follow up
Asymptomatic first-degree or type I second-degree AV block
First-degree AV block has been associated with about a 2-fold increase in the probability of atrial fibrillation, a
3-fold increase in the probability of pacemaker implantation, and an increase in all-cause mortality.[2]
Asymptomatic advanced AV block (type II second-degree or third-
degree)
In symptomatic patients with irreversible AV block, symptoms are likely to persist or potentially worsen.
Patients with irreversible advanced AV block (type II second-degree or third-degree) are at high risk for
progression to third-degree AV block or ventricular asystole.[41] As such, these patients should be strongly
advised to undergo permanent pacemaker implantation.
Symptomatic AV block treated with a permanent pacemaker
These patients have an excellent prognosis, with a low rate of complications related to the pacemaker.

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
