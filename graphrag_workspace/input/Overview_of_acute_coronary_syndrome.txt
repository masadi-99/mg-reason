Overview of acute coronary syndrome Introduction
Introduction
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to a spectrum of acute myocardial ischemia and/or infarction.
Classically ACS has been divided into three clinical categories according to the presence or absence of ST-
segment elevation on the initial ECG, together with measurement of myocardial biomarkers, such as high-
sensitivity cardiac troponins.[1] [2] In ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) the ECG shows persistent
ST-segment elevation in two or more anatomically contiguous leads. Unstable angina and non-ST-elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) represent a continuum of pathology, differing mainly by the presence of
markers of myocardial damage in NSTEMI.[3] Therefore some guidelines have grouped unstable angina and
NSTEMI as “non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes”.[3]

◊ Unstable angina
» see our comprehensive coverage of Unstable angina (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/149)
Unstable angina (UA) is an acute coronary syndrome that is defined by the absence of biochemical
evidence of myocardial damage.[4] UA is characterized by specific clinical findings of prolonged (>20
minutes) angina at rest; new onset of severe angina; angina that is increasing in frequency, longer in
duration, or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a recent episode of myocardial infarction.[4]
The ECG may be normal or may show ST-segment depression, transient ST-segment elevation, or T-wave
inversion.[4] Cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitivity cardiac troponins) should be measured on presentation
to rule out acute myocardial infarction; subsequent/serial measurements may be needed.[4] [5] The early
management of patients with suspected UA is focused on initial interventions and triage according to the
presumptive diagnosis.
◊ Myocardial infarction, non ST-elevation
» see our comprehensive coverage of Myocardial infarction, non ST-elevation (https://
bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/151)
Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is an acute ischemic event causing myocyte necrosis.
The initial ECG may show ischemic changes such as ST depression, T-wave changes, or transient ST
elevation; however, ECG may also be normal or show non-specific changes. The distinction from unstable
angina (UA) is based on cardiac biomarkers; high-sensitivity cardiac troponins are elevated (>99th
percentile of normal) at presentation or after several hours in NSTEMI.[3] Treatment is directed toward
relief of ischemia, prevention of further thrombosis or embolism, and stabilization of hemodynamic status,
followed by early risk stratification for further treatment.
◊ Myocardial infarction, ST-elevation
» see our comprehensive coverage of Myocardial infarction, ST-elevation (https://bestpractice.bmj.com/
topics/en-us/150)
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is suspected when a patient presents with persistent ST-
segment elevation in two or more anatomically contiguous ECG leads in the context of a consistent clinical
history.[1] Cardiac biomarkers (troponins) are elevated. Treatment should, however, be started immediately
in patients with a typical history and ECG changes, without waiting for laboratory results. Immediate and
prompt reperfusion can prevent or minimize myocardial damage and improve the chances of survival and
recovery.[6]

Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
