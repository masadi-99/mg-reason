Aortic dissection Overview
Summary
Aortic dissection typically presents in men older than 50 years of age, with sudden onset of severe ripping or
tearing substernal or interscapular pain. Patients typically describe the pain as severe “sharp” or “stabbing”,
maximal at onset.
May present with syncope, heart/renal failure, or mesenteric or limb ischemia; oxygen/advanced life support
protocol and hemodynamic support should be instituted without delay when the condition is suspected.
Diagnostic modalities include computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or transthoracic/
transesophageal echocardiography.
Involvement of the ascending aorta and/or arch warrants urgent surgical repair. Dissections of the
descending aorta are managed medically with beta blockade; surgery in this group is reserved for those with
end-organ malperfusion, persistent pain, rapid aneurysmal degeneration, or rupture.
Lifelong surveillance is needed with regular imaging to detect delayed aneurysmal degeneration of the
remaining aorta, which may later require surgery.
Definition
Aortic dissection describes the condition when a separation has occurred in aortic wall intima, causing
blood flow into a new false channel composed of the inner and outer layers of the media. Dissection most
commonly occurs with a discrete intimal tear, but can occur without one. Type A dissection involves the
ascending aorta, with or without involvement of the arch and descending aorta.[1] Type B does not involve
the ascending aorta, and predominantly involves only the descending thoracic (distal to the left subclavian
artery) and/or abdominal aorta.[1] The Society for Vascular Surgery and Society of Thoracic Surgeons have
proposed that aortic dissection be divided into 4 phases, based on time from onset of symptoms: hyperacute
(<24 hours), acute (1-14 days), subacute (15-90 days), and chronic (>90 days).[2]

THEORY
Epidemiology
Globally, reported incidences of aortic dissection range from 3 to 10 cases per 100,000 patients in the United
States to 16 cases per 100,000 patients in Sweden.[6] One prospective UK-based population study derived
an incidence of 6 cases per 100,000 when out-of-hospital deaths were included.[7] Men are predominantly
affected, typically between the ages of 50 and 70 years; patients with Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic
valve, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and vascular Ehlers-Danhlos syndrome present at younger ages.[4] The true
incidence of acute aortic dissection may be underrepresented by these population reports, given that many
patients die before reaching a hospital, with the cause of death never proven.[6]
Etiology
Aortic dissection results from an intimal tear that extends into the media of the aortic wall. Cystic medial
degeneration predisposes to intimal disruption and is characterized by elastin, collagen, and smooth muscle
breakdown in the lamina media. Bleeding from the vasa vasorum can also lead to this condition.
Inherited conditions that lead to medial degeneration provide a morphologic substrate for developing
aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome lead to weakening of the media, thus
predisposing to aortic dilation and dissection. Bicuspid aortic valve may be associated with a nonspecific
connective-tissue disease, predisposing to aortic aneurysm and/or dissection. Aortic atherosclerosis
with dilation, and inflammatory or traumatic conditions or infections, may also predispose to aneurysmal
degeneration and dissection. Although rare, iatrogenic causes of aortic dissection include aortic manipulation
associated with cardiac surgery or interventional procedures.[8] It is unclear if these iatrogenic complications
occur in patients already predisposed by the etiologies described above.

Pathophysiology
An intimal tear is the initial event, with subsequent degeneration of the medial layer of the aortic wall.
Blood then passes through the media, propagating distally or proximally and creating a false lumen. As
the dissection propagates, flow through the false lumen can occlude flow through branches of the aorta,
including the coronary, brachiocephalic, intercostal, visceral and renal, or iliac vessels.
The intimal tears of dissection most commonly occur just above the sinotubular junction or just distal to the
left subclavian artery.[9] Regardless of where tears occur in the aorta, there may be both a retrograde and
antegrade extension of the dissection.[6] Retrograde dissections starting in the ascending aorta can lead to
aortic incompetence by separating the aortic valve from the aortic root.
Static narrowing of side branches occurs when the line of dissection intersects the vessel origin and the
aortic hematoma has propagated into the vessel wall, leading to stenosis or occlusion of the side branch.
Dynamic compression occurs when the dissection flap is on the opposite side of the side-branch origin.
Obstruction of the side branch occurs during diastole, when the true lumen collapses and the intimal flap
closes over the ostium of the branch vessel. Flow is restored during systole. Both static and dynamic
compression of a side branch or a combination of both can lead to total flow occlusion and end-organ

ischemia.[6] Subsequent clinical manifestations occur depending on the extent of propagation of the
dissection with subsequent organ malperfusion.[4][6]
Laplace's law describes wall stress as directly proportional to pressure and radius, and inversely proportional
to wall thickness. Thus, factors that weaken the aortic wall, particularly the lamina media, lead to increased
risk of aneurysm formation and dissection, and a cycle of increasing wall stress.[6]

Case history
Case history #1
A 59-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of excruciating chest pain,
which he describes as "stabbing". There is a history of hypertension. On physical examination, his heart
rate is 95 bpm. Blood pressure is 195/90 mmHg in the right arm and 160/80 mmHg in the left arm. Pulses
are absent in the right leg and diminished in the left.
Other presentations
The pain of aortic dissection usually manifests as acute, tearing chest and back pain (Stanford Type A)
or tearing back pain (Stanford Type B). It may also migrate through the thorax or abdomen. Although
the classic textbook description is of acute tearing or ripping pain, patients more commonly describe the
abrupt onset of severe “sharp” or “stabbing” pain, maximal at onset.[4]
Symptoms of stroke or visceral or acute limb ischemia may be present. Patients may be hemodynamically
stable or in hypovolemic shock. Occasionally, depressed mental status or neurologic changes, limb
pain, paresthesias or weakness, paraplegia, or syncope are presenting symptoms. Infrequently (less
than 10%), patients present atypically without pain.[5] There may be signs of heart failure, pericardial
tamponade, or a left pleural effusion. Younger patients can present with a recent history of heavy lifting or
cocaine use.
Patients with connective-tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome often present in their 30s, most often
due to aortic root enlargement. Patients with Marfan syndrome with a normal diameter aorta may also be
at risk.[4]

Aortic dissection Diagnosis
Approach
Aortic dissection should be suspected when an abrupt onset of tearing or ripping chest, back or abdominal
pain is reported.[10] [11] Patients typically describe the pain as severe “sharp” or “stabbing”, maximal at
onset.[4] Missing the diagnosis may be catastrophic, hence the importance of acute history taking to prompt
further investigation.[11] [27]
The usual presentation is a male patient in their 50s, but the condition may occur in younger patients who
have Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or other connective-tissue disorders.[14] [4] Other high-
risk scenarios include a family history of aortic disease or connective-tissue disorder, known aortic disease
or thoracic aortic aneurysm, and previous aortic manipulation (including cardiac surgery).[10] [11] Most
patients have prior hypertension, often poorly controlled.[10] [11] Younger patients may have a connective-
tissue disorder, or a recent history of heavy lifting or cocaine use. Because of the severity of the condition,
the diagnosis should be considered in young patients, even when predisposing factors are absent.
Signs and symptoms
Acute onset of severe chest or back pain heralds acute aortic dissection in 80% to 90% of patients.[11]
The pain associated with aortic dissection may be located retrosternally, interscapularly, or in the lower
back.[10] [14] Although the classic textbook description is of acute “tearing” or “ripping” pain, patients
more commonly report the abrupt onset of severe “sharp” or “stabbing” pain, maximal at onset.[4] Anterior
chest pain is typically associated with an ascending dissection; interscapular pain usually occurs with a
descending dissection.[10] [14] Pain may migrate through the thorax or abdomen, and the location of pain
may change with time as the dissection extends.[10] [14] A minority of patients present with syncope and
no pain.[11]
It is important to recognize that no single symptom of aortic dissection is pathognomonic for the condition,
as there is overlap with cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and musculoskeletal disorders.
Patients may be hemodynamically stable or in hypovolemic shock.[4] Blood pressure differences in
the upper extremities or pulse deficits in the lower extremities should be sought.[10] [4] A pulse deficit
is particularly common in a proximal dissection affecting the aortic arch.[10] [11] The deficit may be
unilateral or bilateral depending on the level of the intimal flap.[10] A pulse deficit may also be present
in more distal aortic dissections (e.g., of the descending aorta) and, in some cases, may lead to acute
limb ischemia. However, pulse deficits are less common than in more proximal dissections.[10] A
difference in systolic blood pressure of greater than 20 mmHg between the two arms is a key sign of
aortic dissection.[4]
Neurologic deficits may indicate involvement of cerebral or intercostal vessels. There may be depressed
mental status, limb pain, paresthesia, weakness, or paraplegia. Symptoms of visceral ischemia may be
present. Occasionally, a diastolic decrescendo murmur may be discovered, indicating aortic insufficiency.
There may be symptoms or signs of heart failure, pericardial tamponade, or a left pleural effusion.[11]
See Pleural effusion .
One systematic review identified neurologic deficit, hypotension, and a pulse deficit as the three clinical
examination findings with the highest positive likelihood ratios for aortic dissection.[28]

Aortic dissection Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Tests
The choice of investigations for diagnostic work-up of acute dissection is based on the patient’s
hemodynamic status, likelihood of aortic dissection, and local availability and expertise.[10] [4] Initial
work-up includes ECG, and cardiac enzymes to exclude myocardial infarction.[4][10] [14] See ST-
elevation myocardial infarction . 
Myocardial ischemia or infarction may be present in 10% to 15% of patients with aortic dissection, which
can mask the diagnosis of dissection.[10]
Blood tests including a complete metabolic panel and complete blood count, including blood type and
crossmatch, should also be requested. Despite a high sensitivity, D-dimer is not recommended as the
sole screening tool for acute aortic dissection; while negative D-dimer may be helpful to rule out aortic
dissection in low-risk patients, particularly when used within an integrated decision support tool, a
positive D-dimer lacks specificity when used in isolation.[29] [30] However, D-dimer will be of value when
considering the differential diagnosis (e.g., pulmonary embolus).[27] Other biomarkers with the potential
to assist in the diagnosis of aortic dissection include C-reactive protein, elastin degradation products,
calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, but none of these have been validated.[31]
In patients with a suspected aortic dissection, computed tomography angiography (CTA) is recommended
for initial diagnostic imaging, given its wide availability, accuracy, and speed, as well as the extent of
anatomic detail it provides.[4] [24] [10] [11] [14] [32] [33] [34] CTA has a sensitivity greater than 90% and
specificity greater than 85% for acute aortic syndromes, including aortic dissection.[10] CTA also shows
the full extent of the dissection and, in some cases, the entry tear site. CTA can detect the presence
and mechanism of aortic branch vessel involvement as well as vessel patency, signs of malperfusion,
pericardial effusion and hemopericardium, periaortic or mediastinal hematoma, and pleural effusion.[4]
 For patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast, CT without contrast is an acceptable alternative. 
The diagnosis of aortic dissection is made by imaging an intimal flap separating 2 lumens. If the false
lumen is completely thrombosed, central displacement of the intimal flap, calcification, or separation
of intimal layers are definitive signs of aortic dissection. CTA also allows visualization of the extent of
dissection and involvement of side branches.
A plain chest x-ray is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for aortic dissection to be used as a
diagnostic tool. A chest x-ray may reveal other causes of acute chest pain.[4][10] [32] [33] [4] Widening
of the mediastinum or pleural effusion can indicate aortic dissection but is of limited diagnostic value,
particularly if the dissection is confined to the ascending aorta; chest x-ray is normal in up to 40% of
patients with aortic dissection.[11] [14] [34] [35]
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) may be used in the emergency department, intensive care unit
(ICU), or operating room for acute proximal dissections if the patient is clinically unstable and there is any
question about the diagnosis, or if CTA is unavailable or contraindicated.[11] [32] [36] [4] TTE can show
pericardial effusion or aortic regurgitation, and a dissection flap can sometimes be visualized; however,
more complete imaging of the aortic arch requires transesophageal echocardiography or CTA.[4]
For type A dissections (ascending), transesophageal echocardiography may be done in the ICU or
operating room to confirm the diagnosis and better evaluate the aortic valve.[11] Sensitivity and specificity
are higher than for TTE.

Aortic dissection Diagnosis
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is most often used as a follow-up imaging modality in patients in
which there is diagnostic uncertainty.[4] Magnetic resonance angiography is the most accurate, sensitive,
and specific test for aortic dissection, but is rarely used in the acute setting because it is more difficult to
obtain than CTA.[2] [10]
In the setting of type B dissections (descending), if medical therapy fails and surgery is required,
intraoperative intravascular ultrasound helps define the morphology of the dissection and assists in the
treatment plan.
If the patient presents with an incidental finding of chronic dissection (such as mediastinal widening or
prominent aortic knob on chest x-ray), diagnosis is confirmed by cross-sectional imaging such as CTA,
TTE, or MRI.[24] [10]

History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
acute severe chest pain (common)
• Acute onset of a severe tearing or ripping chest pain suggests aortic dissection.[11] [4] Although this is
the the classic textbook description of pain in aortic dissection, patients more commonly describe the
pain as severe “sharp” or “stabbing”, maximal at onset.[4]
• Pain may migrate through the thorax or abdomen, and the location of pain may change with time as
the dissection extends.[10] [14] Anterior pain occurs with dissection of ascending aorta.
acute severe interscapular and lower back pain (common)
• Occurs with dissection of the descending aorta.[11] Pain may migrate through the thorax or abdomen,
and the location of pain may change with time as the dissection extends.[10] [14] [4]
features of Marfan syndrome (common)
• Patients may exhibit typical marfanoid features including tall stature, arachnodactyly, pectus
excavatum, hypermobile joints, high-arched palate, and narrow face.[10] [11]
features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (common)
• Vascular (type IV) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome predisposes to both aneurysms and/or dissections.[4]
 Features include translucent skin, easy bruising, hypermobility of small joints, and premature aging of
the skin (acrogeria).[10] [11] [37]
left/right blood pressure differential (common)
• A difference in systolic blood pressure of greater than 20 mmHg between the two arms is a key sign of
aortic dissection.[4]
pulse deficit (common)
• A pulse deficit (reduction or absence of a pulse) is particularly common in a proximal dissection
affecting the aortic arch.[10] [11] [4] The deficit may be unilateral or bilateral depending on the level of
the intimal flap. Pulse deficits may be present in more distal aortic dissections (e.g., of the descending
aorta) and, in some cases, may lead to acute limb ischemia. However, pulse deficits are less common
than in more proximal dissections.[10]
diastolic murmur (common)
• Crescendo pattern, indicating aortic incompetence. Common in proximal dissections, but uncommon
in distal dissections.
syncope (uncommon)
• Up to 10% of patients may present with syncope and no pain.[38]
hypotension (uncommon)
• Associated with cardiac tamponade and/or hypovolemic shock.[4]

Other diagnostic factors
hypertension (common)
• Due to pre-existing hypertensive condition or increased sympathetic drive.
dyspnea (uncommon)
• May indicate new-onset heart failure because of acute aortic insufficiency during proximal dissections,
or cardiac tamponade.
altered mental status (uncommon)
• Due to cerebral ischemia.
paraplegia (uncommon)
• Due to compromise of intercostal vessels and subsequent spinal cord ischemia.[4]
hemiparesis/paresthesia (uncommon)
• Due to cerebral or peripheral ischemia.
abdominal pain (uncommon)
• Visceral ischemia resulting from compromised organ perfusion.
limb pain/pallor (uncommon)
• Due to compromised limb perfusion.
left-sided decreased breath sounds/dullness (uncommon)
• Left pleural effusion.
Risk factors
Strong
hypertension
• Most patients have prior hypertension, often poorly controlled.[10] [11] The International Registry of
Acute Aortic Dissection found that 77% of patients with aortic dissection had a history of hypertension
and 27% had a history of atherosclerosis.[12]
atherosclerotic aneurysmal disease
• Approximately 1% of sudden deaths are attributable to aortic rupture. Of these, two-thirds are due to
dissection and one third to degenerative aneurysms.[13]
Marfan syndrome
• Predisposes to both aneurysms and/or dissections, presumably related to weakness of the aortic
wall.[4][14]

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
• Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV predisposes to both aneurysms and/or dissections, presumably
related to weakness of the aortic wall.[4][14]
bicuspid aortic valve
• Predisposes to both aneurysms and/or dissections, presumably related to weakness of the aortic
wall.[4]
annuloaortic ectasia
• Predisposes to both aneurysms and/or dissections, presumably related to weakness of the aortic wall.
coarctation
• Untreated coarctation in adults is associated with dissection and is probably related to longstanding
hypertension.

• Family history confers increased risk.[10] [11] [15]
Weak
older age
• The usual presentation is a man in his 50s. However, aortic dissection can occur in younger patients,
even in the absence of connective-tissue disorders, and should be considered given the severity of the
process.[4]
giant cell arteritis
• Can weaken the media of the aorta and lead to expansion or dissection.

• Clinical or laboratory features of several connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and Sjogren
syndrome, without meeting the criteria for a specific diagnosis.
surgical/catheter manipulation
• Manipulation of at-risk aortas: examples of procedures include cardiac catheterization, aortic valve
replacement, or thoracic stent-grafting.[8] [11] [16]
cocaine/amphetamine use
• Acute hypertension, vasoconstriction, increased stroke volume, and vasospasm as a result of the
misuse of these agents may lead to aortic dissection. Younger age at presentation is typical.[17]
heavy lifting
• Typically confined to young patients and theoretically attributed to the elevated aortic pressure during
straining.
pregnancy
• Case reports; for example, in conjunction with Marfan syndrome.[18] [19]
nondiabetic
• One systematic review and meta-analysis found that diabetes is associated with a lower prevalence
of aortic dissection and abdominal aortic aneurysm.[20] Data from one observational Swedish study
showed that type 2 diabetes reduces the relative risk of aortic dissection by 47% over 7 years.[21]
There are some data suggesting that metformin therapy may be responsible for the lower abdominal
aortic aneurysm rates seen in adults with diabetes,[22] [23] but the potential mechanism is yet to be
determined.

full extent of the dissection and, in some cases, the entry tear site.
CTA can detect the presence and mechanism of aortic branch
vessel involvement, as well as vessel patency, signs of malperfusion,
pericardial effusion and hemopericardium, periaortic or mediastinal

• Neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for aortic dissection to
be used as a diagnostic tool. Excludes pneumonia and may also
reveal other causes of chest pain.[4][10] [32] [33] Widening of the
mediastinum or pleural effusion can indicate aortic dissection but is of
limited diagnostic value for diagnosis of aortic dissection, particularly
if the dissection is confined to the ascending aorta; chest x-ray is
normal in up to 40% of patients with aortic dissection.[11] [14] [34]

D-dimer
• Despite a high sensitivity, D-dimer is not recommended as the sole
screening tool for acute aortic dissection; while negative D-dimer may
be helpful to rule out aortic dissection in low-risk patients, particularly
when used within an integrated decision support tool, a positive D-
dimer lacks specificity when used in isolation.[29] [30] However, D-
dimer will be of value when considering the differential diagnosis
(e.g., pulmonary embolus).[27]
positive
transthoracic echocardiography
• Can be ordered as supplementary test, or in unstable patients
when acute proximal dissection is suspected.[32] TTE can show
pericardial effusion or aortic regurgitation, and a dissection flap can
sometimes be visualized; however, more complete imaging of the
aortic arch requires transesophageal echocardiography or CTA.[4]
 Aids diagnosis if the patient presents with an incidental finding of
chronic dissection (such as mediastinal widening or prominent aortic
knob on chest x-ray).
intimal flap
transesophageal echocardiography
• Can be used to confirm the diagnosis and better evaluate the aortic
valve, or if computed tomography angiography is unavailable.
Sensitivity and specificity are higher than for transthoracic
echocardiography.[32] Aids diagnosis if the patient presents with an
incidental finding of chronic dissection (such as mediastinal widening
or prominent aortic knob on chest x-ray).

• MRI is most often used as a follow-up imaging modality where there
is diagnostic uncertainty.[4] Magnetic resonance angiography is very
accurate, but rarely used in the acute setting because it is difficult to
obtain.[40]

• In the setting of type B dissections, if medical therapy fails and

Initial management
Local resuscitation protocols should be followed. Supplemental oxygen and hemodynamic support with
intravenous fluid resuscitation and judicious use of inotropes is recommended in cases of incipient renal
failure and hypovolemic shock. See Acute kidney injury  and Shock .
Initial management of both type A and B dissections involves medical therapy, regardless of definitive
treatment.[10] [14]
Intravenous beta-blockers are used to achieve systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg, or to lowest
blood pressure that maintains adequate end-organ perfusion and an appropriate target heart rate.[4]
Recommendations for target heart rate vary and local protocols should be followed; the American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend a target heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm;
the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American Association for Thoracic Surgery (STS/AATS) recommend

Aortic dissection Management
maintaining a heart rate of <70 bpm; the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends a heart rate
of <60 bpm as the target for medical therapy.[6] [14] [4] 
In patients with contraindications (e.g., acute aortic regurgitation, heart block, bradycardia) or intolerance
to beta-blockers, initial management with an intravenous nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker is
reasonable for heart rate control.[4]
Invasive monitoring of BP with an arterial line in an ICU setting is recommended to decrease aortic wall
stress.[4]
If a beta-blocker (or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone fails, vasodilator therapy (e.g.,
nitroprusside) should be added.[14] [4]
To decrease sympathetic tone and facilitate hemodynamic stability, pain should also be controlled with
intravenous opioids.[10] [14] It should be noted that morphine causes vasodilation and reduces the heart
rate by increasing vagal tone. Intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ketorolac) may not
be suitable because of the risk of inducing hypertension and adverse renal effects.[4]
Type A dissection
In patients presenting with suspected or confirmed acute type A aortic dissection, emergency surgical
consultation and evaluation with immediate surgical intervention is recommended, due to the high risk of
associated life-threatening complications.[4] The mortality rate of medical management alone for acute
type A aortic dissection is two to three times that of surgical intervention.[4] 
In patients who are stable enough, transfer from a low- to high-volume aortic center is reasonable in order
to improve survival.[4]
Depending on the extent of retrograde extension, the aortic valve may or may not need to be repaired
or replaced.[10] This is to prevent cardiac tamponade or fatal exsanguination from aortic rupture.
Therapeutic options include: open aortic arch replacement; transposition of supra-aortic branches with
subsequent endovascular repair; total endovascular repair; or the frozen elephant trunk repair technique,
which combines open repair of the proximal aorta under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, together with
placement of thoracic stent grafts into the distal aortic arch and upper descending thoracic aorta.[34]
In patients with renal, mesenteric, or lower extremity malperfusion, immediate operative repair of the
ascending aorta is recommended.[4]
In patients presenting with clinically significant mesenteric (e.g., celiac, superior mesenteric)
malperfusion, immediate mesenteric revascularization via endovascular or open surgical intervention
before ascending aortic repair is also reasonable.[4] Evidence of mesenteric malperfusion includes
abdominal pain, bowel ischemia, lactic acidosis, elevation of liver function test results.[4]
Of note, stent grafts designed for total endovascular aortic arch repair are currently only available as part
of a clinical trial, and thus the use of this approach using off-the-shelf stent grafts is off-label.
One meta-analysis of comparator observational studies reported lower stroke and mortality rates, but
higher spinal cord ischemia events, with the frozen elephant trunk technique compared with conventional
aortic arch surgery.[43] Longer term follow-up is necessary, and ideally evidence from randomized
controlled trials; however, the technologies designed to treat aortic arch pathology continue to evolve.[44]

MANAGEMENT
Complicated acute type B dissection
Urgent surgical or endovascular intervention is required if type B dissection is complicated by rupture,
visceral or extremity ischemia, aneurysmal expansion, or persistent pain.[4]
Although both open and endovascular therapies are acceptable options, the endovascular approach -
including fenestration and stenting - is gaining preference over the open technique for patients presenting
with complications.[10] [45] [46] [47] [48]
ACC/AHA guidelines recommend endovascular stent grafting, rather than open surgical repair, in patients
with acute type B aortic dissection with rupture in the presence of suitable anatomy.[4] The ACC/AHA
note that an endovascular approach, rather than open surgical repair, is also reasonable in patients
with other complications (e.g., branch artery occlusion and malperfusion, extension of dissection, aortic
enlargement, intractable pain, or uncontrolled hypertension).[4]
The STS/AATS state that TEVAR is indicated for complicated hyperacute, acute, or subacute type B
dissection in patients with favorable anatomy for TEVAR.[6] However, open surgical repair is reasonable
over TEVAR as a more durable treatment in patients with connective tissue disorders who have type B
dissection with progression of disease despite optimal medical therapy.[6]
Several studies have demonstrated high technical success rates for endovascular stenting to seal
proximal entry tears. This promotes false lumen thrombosis and aortic remodeling. Static or dynamic side-
branch obstruction can be relieved with additional endovascular stents. Compromised branches can be
treated with ostial bare stents or stent grafts that enlarge the compressed true lumen. Survival rates and
neurologic complications with endovascular treatment of type B dissections are favorable compared with
those of open surgery.[6] [47] [48] [49]
In the US, there is currently one endovascular stent specifically approved for placement in patients with
type B aortic dissection. This is a modular system consisting of two components: a covered stent graft
intended to seal the entry tear and to exclude aneurysms associated with chronic dissection, and an
uncovered stent that is intended to provide support to distal delaminated segments of nonaneurysmal
aorta with dissection.[50] The uncovered portion of the stent can be placed in the visceral segment of the
aorta, which allows for the placement of stent grafts within individual visceral vessels as necessary. One
prospective multicenter study using this device reported favorable clinical and anatomic outcomes for the
treatment of rupture and malperfusion secondary to acute, complicated type B aortic dissection.[51] Long-
term outcomes of this device remain to be determined.

Uncomplicated acute type B dissection
Patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (i.e., without end-organ malperfusion) are usually
managed medically with blood pressure and pain control during the acute phase (less than 14 days).[24]
[10] [14] [34] The ACC/AHA and STS/AATS state that optimal medical therapy remains the recommended
treatment for patients with uncomplicated type B dissection.[6] [4]
Thoracic endovascular aortic repair
Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is increasingly performed in patients with uncomplicated
dissections in the subacute phase (14 days to 6 weeks) to promote false lumen thrombosis and prevent
aneurysmal degeneration. However, there is considerable heterogeneity of published data; results from
meta-analyses evaluating TEVAR in patients with type B aortic dissection should be interpreted with
caution.

Aortic dissection Management
One meta-analysis found no evidence for survival benefit at 1 year for patients with acute uncomplicated
type B aortic dissection (TBAD) treated with TEVAR compared with those receiving best medical
therapy.[52] Another meta-analysis found that TEVAR did not prevent aneurysmal degeneration in
patients treated for acute or chronic (including complicated) TBAD, noting that long-term data are
lacking.[53] Results from one meta-analysis of a mixed patient population (complicated/uncomplicated,
acute/subacute TBAD) and one randomized study of patients with stable TBAD, respectively, suggest
that aneurysm-specific outcomes may be favorable over the longer term following TEVAR.[54] [55] Larger
trials with longer-term data are still required.[4]
There may be some benefit to early endovascular intervention in patients with uncomplicated acute
type B aortic dissection with refractory pain and hypertension.[56] TEVAR in the subacute phase of
type B dissection may be associated with a lower risk of complications, particularly retrograde type A
dissection.[57]
Chronic aortic dissection
Aortic dissection is a lifelong condition and is defined as chronic at >90 days after the first onset of
symptoms.[24] [10] [14] This includes patients with persisting type A dissection of the descending aorta
following surgical repair of the aortic archery.[10] The patient may also be diagnosed with chronic aortic
dissection if the first diagnosis of aortic dissection is picked up as an incidental finding at the chronic
stage (e.g., an incidental finding of mediastinal widening or prominent aortic knob on chest x-ray).[10] The
largest group of patients with chronic aortic dissection (approximately 60%) are patients with surgically
corrected ascending (Stanford type A) dissection with a persistent false lumen distal to the surgical
repair.[24] Patients with nonoperated type A dissection rarely live past the acute event; hence, chronic
dissections of the ascending aorta are exceedingly rare.[24]
Patients with chronic aortic dissection are managed with the same medical principles as those used in the
acute phase. Blood pressure control is continued after discharge from the hospital.[58] Beta-blockers and
ACE inhibitors are usually required, with additional antihypertensives such as diuretics or calcium-channel
blockers, if necessary, to achieve a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg and an appropriate
target heart rate. In practice a specialist will aim for a target heart rate for chronic aortic dissection that
is the same as for acute aortic dissection. Recommendations for target heart rate vary in acute aortic
dissection and local protocols should be followed; the STS/AATS recommend maintaining heart rate <70
bpm and the ESC recommends heart rate <60 bpm as the target for medical therapy.[6] [14] At least 40%
of patients will require combination treatment to control blood pressure.
Patients should be advised to avoid contact sports and strenuous physical activities (such as isometric
heavy weight lifting, pushing, or straining that would require a Valsalva manoeuvre) to reduce aortic wall
shear stress due to sudden rises in arterial blood pressure during exercise.[10] [14] However, activities
with low static and dynamic stress (mild aerobic exercise and daily activities) can be continued.[10] [14]
The patient should also avoid cocaine or other stimulating drugs such as methamphetamine.[14]
Other interventions include management of risk factors for atherosclerotic disease; in particular: smoking
cessation and lipid-lowering therapy (target of LDL-cholesterol <70 mg/dL).[14] 
Patients with chronic aortic dissection may need open surgical repair or endovascular therapy
(TEVAR) in their lifetime. Indications for surgery in uncomplicated chronic aortic dissections depend
on aortic diameter, pathogenesis, and the presence of symptoms. Asymptomatic chronic thoracic and
thoracoabdominal aortic dissections with a maximal orthogonal aortic diameter of 6.0 cm in patients
without connective tissue disease warrant repair.[24] [10] [59] Rapid growth rate >0.5 cm per year also

may be an indication for repair.[24] Patients with connective tissue diseases and those with a family
history warrant more careful consideration and may warrant earlier intervention (diameter of 5.0–5.5
cm).[24] [60] [61]
TEVAR has been increasingly used for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair occuring
after aortic dissection because of the low acute risk compared with open repair and the potential to
reduce aortic mortality and reoperations compared with medical therapy.[24] However, TEVAR faces
anatomic and morphological limitations to successfully treating this disease, particularly in the chronic
stage.[24] [62] [63] [64] [65] TEVAR may be a viable rescue option for patients with type A dissection who
are not eligible for open surgical repair.[66]
The goals of TEVAR therapy are to:
• cover the entry tear
• treat or prevent impending rupture
• re-establish organ perfusion
• restore flow in the true lumen
• induce the false lumen thrombosis.
One Cochrane review noted a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials
investigating the effectiveness and safety of TEVAR compared to open surgical repair for patients with
complicated chronic type B aortic dissection. The investigators were therefore unable to provide any
evidence to inform decision-making on the optimal intervention for these patients.[67]
In a retrospective analysis of 80 patients who underwent TEVAR for chronic type B aortic dissections,
complete false lumen thrombosis was achieved in 52% and aneurysm diameter was stabilized or reduced
in 65%. Five-year overall survival was 70%.[62] In a prospective multicenter trial from China, TEVAR
for chronic type B aortic dissection decreased the risk of aortic-related mortality compared with optimal
medical therapy alone at 4 years, but failed to improve overall survival. The thoracic aorta diameter
decreased significantly in the TEVAR group, but increased in the medical therapy group.[68] There
currently are no longer-term data on the efficacy of TEVAR for chronic type B aortic dissection.

decrease aortic wall stress.[4]
plus opioid analgesia
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» morphine sulfate: 2-5 mg intravenously
every 5-30 minutes as needed
» Pain control is an important first-line therapy
to reduce sympathetic tone and facilitate
hemodynamic stability.[10] [14] It should be
noted that morphine causes vasodilation and
reduces the heart rate by increasing vagal tone.
beta-blocker or calcium-
channel blocker

plus vasodilator
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
Primary options
» nitroprusside: 0.3 to 0.5 micrograms/kg/
min intravenously initially, increase by 0.5
micrograms/kg/min increments; maximum 10
micrograms/kg/min
» If first-line treatment with beta-blockers (or
nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
in patients with contraindications or intolerance
to beta-blockers) and analgesia fail to achieve
a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg
and an appropriate target heart rate, then
intravenous antihypertensive vasodilator therapy
(such as nitroprusside) should be added.[14] [4]
type A plus open surgery or endovascular stent-graft
repair
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Type A dissection involves the ascending
aorta with or without involvement of the arch
and descending aorta. In patients presenting
with suspected or confirmed acute type A aortic
dissection, emergency surgical consultation and
evaluation with immediate surgical intervention is
recommended, due to the high risk of associated
life-threatening complications.[4] The mortality
rate of medical management alone for acute
type A aortic dissection is two to three times
that of surgical intervention.[38] In patients who
are stable enough, transfer from a low- to high-
volume aortic center is reasonable in order to
improve survival.[4]

Aortic dissection Management
Acute
» Depending on the extent of retrograde
extension, the aortic valve may or may not need
to be repaired or replaced.[10] This is to prevent
cardiac tamponade or fatal exsanguination from
aortic rupture.
» Therapeutic options include: open aortic
arch replacement; transposition of supra-
aortic branches with subsequent endovascular
repair; total endovascular repair; or the frozen
elephant trunk repair technique, which combines
open repair of the proximal aorta under deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest, together with
placement of thoracic stent grafts into the distal
aortic arch and upper descending thoracic
aorta.[34] 
» In patients with renal, mesenteric, or
lower extremity malperfusion, immediate
operative repair of the ascending aorta is
recommended.[4] In patients presenting with
clinically significant mesenteric (e.g., celiac,
superior mesenteric) malperfusion, immediate
mesenteric revascularization via endovascular
or open surgical intervention before ascending
aortic repair is also reasonable.[4] Evidence of
mesenteric malperfusion includes abdominal
pain, bowel ischemia, lactic acidosis, elevation of
liver function test results.[4]
» One meta-analysis of comparator
observational studies reported lower stroke
and mortality rates, but higher spinal cord
ischemia events, with the frozen elephant trunk
technique compared with conventional aortic
arch surgery.[43] Longer term follow-up is
necessary.[44]
type B with complications
(rupture, visceral/
extremity ischemia,
expansion, or persistent
pain)
plus endovascular stent-graft repair or open
surgery
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Type B dissection involves only the descending
thoracic aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery)
and/or abdominal aorta.
» Urgent surgical or endovascular intervention
is required if type B dissection is complicated
by rupture, visceral or extremity ischemia,
aneurysmal expansion, or persistent pain.[4]
» For complicated type B dissections, the goal
of open surgery is to resect/cover the entry
tear and re-establish flow into compromised
branch vessels. Although both open and
endovascular therapies are acceptable
options, the endovascular approach - including

over the open technique for patients presenting
with complications.[10] [45] [46] [47] [48]
» American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines
recommend endovascular stent grafting rather
than open surgical repair in patients with acute
type B aortic dissection with rupture, in the
presence of suitable anatomy.[4] The ACC/AHA
note that an endovascular approach, rather
than open surgical repair, is also reasonable in
patients with other complications (e.g., branch
artery occlusion and malperfusion, extension of
dissection, aortic enlargement, intractable pain,
or uncontrolled hypertension).[4] The Society
of Thoracic Surgeons/American Association
for Thoracic Surgery (STS/AATS) state that
TEVAR is indicated in patients with complicated
hyperacute, acute, or subacute type B dissection
and favorable anatomy for TEVAR.[6] However,
open surgical repair is reasonable over TEVAR
as a more durable treatment in patients with
connective tissue disorders who have type B
dissection with progression of disease despite
optimal medical therapy.[6]
type B uncomplicated adjunct endovascular stent-graft repair
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with uncomplicated type B aortic
dissection (i.e., without end-organ malperfusion)
are usually managed medically with blood
pressure and pain control during the acute
phase (less than 14 days).[24] [10] [14] [34]
 The American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association and the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons/American Association for Thoracic
Surgery state that optimal medical therapy
remains the recommended treatment for patients
with uncomplicated type B dissection.[6] 
» Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)
is increasingly performed in patients with
uncomplicated dissections in the subacute
phase (14 days to 6 weeks) to promote false
lumen thrombosis and prevent aneurysmal
degeneration. However, there is considerable
heterogeneity of published data; results
from meta-analyses evaluating TEVAR in
patients with type B aortic dissection should be
interpreted with caution.

meta-analysis found that TEVAR did not prevent
aneurysmal degeneration in patients treated
for acute or chronic (including complicated)
TBAD, noting that long-term data are lacking.[53]
Results from one meta-analysis of a mixed
patient population (complicated/uncomplicated,
acute/subacute TBAD) and one randomized
study of patients with stable TBAD, respectively,
suggest that aneurysm-specific outcomes may
be favorable over the longer term following
TEVAR.[54] [55] Larger trials with longer-term
data are still required.[4]
» There may be some benefit to early
endovascular intervention in patients
with uncomplicated acute type B aortic
dissection with refractory pain and
hypertension.[56] TEVAR in the subacute
phase of type B dissection may be associated
with a lower risk of complications, particularly
retrograde type A dissection.[57]
chronic (all types) adjunct open surgery or endovascular stent-graft
repair
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Patients with chronic aortic dissection may
need open surgical repair or endovascular
therapy (TEVAR) in their lifetime; some will not
have open surgical repair or TEVAR previously
while others might have one of the procedures
for the second time.
» Indications for surgery in uncomplicated
chronic aortic dissections depend on aortic
diameter, pathogenesis, and the presence of
symptoms. Asymptomatic chronic thoracic and
thoracoabdominal aortic dissections with a
maximal orthogonal aortic diameter of 6.0 cm
in patients without connective tissue disease
warrant repair.[24] [10] [59] Rapid growth rate
>0.5 cm per year also may be an indication
for repair.[24] Patients with connective tissue
diseases and those with a family history warrant
more careful consideration and may warrant
earlier intervention (diameter of 5.0–5.5 cm).[24]
[60] [61]
» The use of thoracic endovascular aortic repair
(TEVAR) has been increasingly used for thoracic

and morphological limitations to successfully
treating this disease, particularly in the chronic
stage.[24] [62] [63] [64] [65] TEVAR may be a
viable rescue option for patients with type A
dissection who are not eligible for open surgical
repair.[66]
» The goals of TEVAR therapy are to: cover the
entry tear; treat or prevent impending rupture; re-
establish organ perfusion; restore flow in the true
lumen; and induce the false lumen thrombosis.
» One Cochrane review noted a lack of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
controlled clinical trials investigating the
effectiveness and safety of TEVAR compared
to open surgical repair for patients with
complicated chronic type B aortic dissection.
The investigators were therefore unable to
provide any evidence to inform decision-making
on the optimal intervention for these patients.[67]
In a retrospective analysis of 80 patients who
underwent TEVAR for chronic type B aortic
dissections, complete false lumen thrombosis
was achieved in 52% and aneurysm diameter
was stabilized or reduced in 65%. Five-year
overall survival was 70%. 
» In a prospective multicenter trial from China,
TEVAR for chronic type B aortic dissection
decreased the risk of aortic-related mortality
compared with optimal medical therapy
alone at 4 years, but failed to improve overall
survival. The thoracic aorta diameter decreased
significantly in the TEVAR group, but increased
in the medical therapy group.[68]

Aortic dissection Management
Primary prevention
Hypertension should be assessed for and treated appropriately in all patients.[24] Other cardiovascular
risk factors (e.g., dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus) should be intensively managed. Smokers should be
encouraged to cease smoking, and offered counseling and/or smoking cessation therapy if they are willing.
Drug use (specifically cocaine) is associated with aortic dissection, even without other risk factors, and
should be strongly discouraged in patients with concomitant risk factors.[11] [17] [25] [26]
Secondary prevention
Patients with known Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome should be regularly monitored with
echocardiography for aortic root aneurysm (predisposing to dissection).[4]
Blood pressure control to less than 150 mmHg (preferably less than 120 mmHg) systolic and less than 90
mmHg is recommended. No data support exact goals, but shear forces are excessive when systolic blood
pressure exceeds 150 mmHg. Heart rate should be maintained less than 80 bpm. Beta blockade is first-line
treatment.
Patient discussions
Patients should be advised to avoid contact sports and strenuous physical activities (such as isometric
heavy weight lifting, pushing, or straining that would require a Valsalva manoeuvre) to reduce aortic wall
shear stress due to sudden rises in arterial blood pressure during exercise.[10] [14] However, activities
with low static and dynamic stress (mild aerobic exercise and daily activities) can be continued.[10] [14]
The patient should also avoid cocaine or other stimulating drugs such as methamphetamine.[14]
Patients should follow up for surveillance imaging and blood pressure control.[24] Smoking cessation
and control of hyperlipidemia is important for overall vascular health.[14] It is recommended that patients
maintain a heart-healthy diet.

Monitoring
Monitoring
Imaging of the aorta should be performed before discharge.[24] The time intervals suggested for
surveillance imaging with computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography
(MRA) in patients with chronic aortic dissection vary across guidelines and should be tailored for
individual patients.[24]
The American Heart Association notes that several reasonable follow-up regimens have been proposed
for different treatment groups.[24] After surgical repair, patients should be followed up after 6 and
12 months, and annually thereafter.[24] If a moderate-sized aneurysm remains relatively stable over
time, subsequent longer follow-up intervals of 1.5 to 3 years are reasonable. In medically managed
uncomplicated type B dissection, one additional earlier scan, for example, at 3 months, may reveal
important changes occurring in the subacute phase, when the dissected aorta remains amenable to
early TEVAR. Earlier follow-up imaging at 30 days is sometimes recommended to identify potential early
complications, followed by routine 6-month and 12-month follow-up.[24] [10] [79] Continued annual
imaging is suggested thereafter. If growth or other complications are detected, shorter follow-up intervals
may be required in all treatment groups.[24] [4] CTA is recommended as the imaging of choice for follow-
up of patients who have undergone TEVAR.[10] However, MRI is preferred in younger patients to reduce
radiation exposure.[10] [14]

Aortic dissection Follow up
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
pericardial tamponade short term high
Occurs when an ascending aortic dissection extends proximally with rupture into the pericardial space.[11]
Emergency surgical repair of the aortic dissection is required. The team may wish to prepare the patient's
chest for incision while the patient is awake in the event that the patient sustains cardiac arrest during the
induction of anesthesia.
aortic incompetence short term high
Occurs when dissection propagates proximally, leading to loss of commissural support for the valve
leaflets. Urgent surgical repair of the dissected aorta with aortic valve repair or replacement is required.
myocardial infarction short term low
Occurs when the dissection propagates proximally and coronary ostial occlusion occurs.[11] Urgent
surgical repair of the aortic dissection with coronary reconstruction and/or coronary bypass grafting is
required.
aneurysmal degeneration/rupture variable medium
Aneurysms develop in 34% to 38% of patients with chronic type B aortic dissection and in up to 49% of
patients with residual chronic aortic dissection in the distal aorta after type A aortic repair.[24]
Complications from distal aortic dissection occur in 20% to 50% of patients. This occurs due to continued
pulsatile force (dP/dt) on already-thinned walls of the false channel or new dissection.
A multidrug antihypertensive regimen including beta blockade to maintain systolic pressure less than 120
mmHg may alter the natural history of chronic dissection by diminishing the rate of aneurysmal dilation.[4]
[73]
Open surgical repair remains the dominant method of managing chronic aneurysmal thoracoabdominal
aortic dissections.[24]
regional ischemia variable low
Cerebral, renal, visceral, spinal cord, or lower-extremity ischemia occur when the dissection propagates
distally and true lumen occlusion occurs.
Emergency surgical or endovascular repair of the dissected aorta with or without additional
revascularization of compromised branch vessels is required.[4]
left arm ischemia/subclavian steal syndrome variable low
Occurs when the left subclavian artery is covered after endovascular aortic repair in approximately 15%
of patients. The Society for Vascular Surgeons Practice Guidelines recommends routine preoperative
revascularization of the left subclavian artery for patients who need elective stent-graft repair where
achievement of a proximal seal necessitates coverage of the left subclavian artery, and selective
revascularization in urgent indications.[74] [75] This can result in subclavian steal syndrome.

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
endoleak variable low
The risk of endoleak following thoracic endovascular aortic repair is low (estimated at 4.7%).[76]
Depending on the location and type of endoleak, it may require reintervention.[77] [78]
Endoleak is not a complication following open repair.
Prognosis
Syncope at presentation is usually associated with worse outcomes. A deadly triad of hypotension/shock
(not syncope), lack of chest or back pain (presumably related to delay in diagnosis), and branch vessel
involvement is also described.[69]
Left untreated, the natural history of proximal acute aortic dissection is of false channel rupture with fatal
exsanguination in 50% to 60% of patients within 24 hours.[70]
Patients with nonoperated type A dissection rarely live past the acute event.[24] In tertiary high-volume
referral centers for aortic diseases, the surgical mortality for ascending and hemiarch replacement with
or without root replacement is as low as 10% to 20%.[24] The midterm survival of surgically corrected
ascending dissections at 1, 3, and 5 years is 95%, 93%, and 89%, respectively.[24] The 10-year survival
after surgery of ascending aortic dissection is 52%. Freedom from re-operation at both 5 and 10 years
ranges from 59% to 95%.[46]

Aortic dissection Follow up
Dissection status post proximal repair with late distal aneurysm
From the collection of Dr Eric E. Roselli; used with permission
 
Patients with uncomplicated type B dissection (i.e., those without signs of rupture, rapid expansion, or branch
vessel malperfusion; approximately 60% to 70% of type B dissections) can be safely managed medically.
Almost all patients with initially uncomplicated type B dissection therefore progress to the chronic phase with
a 20% to 50% risk of late adverse events.[24] Complicated type B dissections (ie, those requiring urgent
endovascular or surgical repair for aortic rupture, rapid expansion, or branch vessel malperfusion, as well
as those patients too sick to undergo an acute intervention) represent approximately 30% to 40% of type
B dissections. The in-hospital mortality of these patients is approximately 20%.[24] Late degeneration of
the dissected aorta into a false lumen aneurysm occurs in 30% to 50% of patients.[71] Following treatment,
patients remain at risk for further aneurysmal degeneration of remaining diseased aorta.  
The 5-year survival after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute type B aortic dissection is
81%.[72]
Longer term outcomes after TEVAR for the treatment of either acute or chronic type B aortic dissection are
currently unknown.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no

quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
