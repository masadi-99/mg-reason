ST-elevation myocardial infarction Overview
Summary
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presents with central chest pain that is classically heavy in nature,
like a sensation of pressure or squeezing. Examination is variable, and findings range from normal to a
critically ill patient in cardiogenic shock.
A clinical working diagnosis of STEMI is made when a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of
myocardial ischemia and has persistent ST-segment elevation in two or more anatomically contiguous ECG
leads.
Cardiac biomarkers (e.g., cardiac-specific troponins) confirm diagnosis. Treatment should, however, be
started immediately in patients with a typical history and ECG changes, without waiting for laboratory results.
Immediate and prompt revascularization can prevent or decrease myocardial damage and decrease
morbidity and mortality. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the best management option for
most patients, with fibrinolysis reserved for those without access to timely primary PCI.
Survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) should receive cardiac rehabilitation and be closely followed up
to ensure adequate modification of risk factors and optimization of (and adherence to) pharmacotherapy for
secondary prevention, and to monitor for the development of post MI complications and/or residual angina
symptoms.
Definition
Myocardial infarction is the irreversible necrosis of heart muscle that occurs because of a prolonged
mismatch between perfusion and demand.[1] This is usually caused by occlusion in the coronary arteries.
In the appropriate clinical context, a STEMI is diagnosed clinically when there is new (or increased) and
persistent ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads of ≥1 mm in all leads other than leads V2-
V3 where the following cutoff points apply:[2]
• ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years old
• ≥2 mm in men >40 years old
• ≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age
1 mm = 1 small square (at a standard ECG calibration of 10 mm/mV).
Contiguous ECG leads lie next to each other anatomically and indicate a specific myocardial territory.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide; accounting for 17.9 million deaths per
year.[6]
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common cause of cardiovascular death; data from the European
Society of Cardiology in 2019 showed that IHD accounted for 38% of cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths in
females and 44% in males.[3] [7]
The incidence and mortality of ischemic heart disease has decreased in high-income countries over the past
30 years, which may be due to better control of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,
and smoking.[8] However, mortality is increasing in developing and transitional countries, with more than
75% of CVD deaths occurring in developing countries.[6] These trends reflect changes in population
longevity, urbanization, and lifestyle changes.[6] Despite the overall reduction in incidence, in the US the
estimated incidence is 605,000 new and 200,000 recurrent myocardial infarctions (MIs) annually; according
to American Heart Association estimates, every 40 seconds an American will have an MI.[9]
MI affects both men and women, but tends to occur at a younger age in men. The average age of a person
having a first MI is 65.6 years for men and 72 years for women.[9] The incidence in women increases
after menopause. Women ages under 60 years with ST-elevation myocardial infarction have higher 30-day
mortality rates even after adjustment for medications, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, and other
coexisting comorbidities.[9] [10]
About 90% of patients with coronary heart disease report at least one major risk factor, including cigarette
smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and abdominal obesity.[11]
Etiology
Myocardial infarction is usually a consequence of coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis with plaque
fissuring or rupture and thrombus formation is the underlying etiology for ST-elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI) in most patients. A small proportion of patients present with STEMI caused by coronary spasm
reducing myocardial perfusion, or following chest trauma or spontaneous coronary or aortic dissection.
Pathophysiology
Atherosclerotic plaques form gradually over years.[12] They begin with the accumulation of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and saturated fat in the intima (the inner layer) of blood vessels. This is followed by
the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium, then diapedesis and entry into the intima, where they accumulate
lipids and become foam cells. Foam cells are a rich source of proinflammatory mediators. The lesion up to
this point is referred to as a fatty streak, and may be reversible to a certain extent.
Subsequent evolution involves migration of smooth muscle cells from the media, and their proliferation and
deposition of extracellular matrix, including proteoglycans, interstitial collagen, and elastin fibers.[12] Some of
the smooth muscle cells in advanced plaques exhibit apoptosis. Plaques often develop areas of calcification
as they evolve. The plaque initially evolves with the artery remodeling outward, followed by encroachment
on the arterial lumen. Eventually the stenosis can limit flow under conditions of increased demand, causing
angina.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Theory
STEMI typically occurs after abrupt and catastrophic disruption of a cholesterol-laden plaque. This results
in exposure of substances that promote platelet activation and aggregation, thrombin generation, and
thrombus formation, causing interruption of blood flow. If the occlusion is severe and persistent, myocardial
cell necrosis follows.
On interruption of blood flow in the coronary artery, the zone of myocardium supplied by that vessel
immediately loses its ability to shorten and perform contractile work. Early hyperkinesis of the noninfarcted
zones occurs, probably as a result of acute compensatory mechanisms including increased sympathetic
activity and Frank-Starling mechanism. As necrotic myocytes slip past each other, the infarction zone thins
and elongates, especially in anterior infarction, leading to infarction expansion.
If a sufficient quantity of myocardium undergoes ischemic injury, left ventricular (LV) pump function becomes
depressed; cardiac output, stroke volume, blood pressure, and compliance are reduced; and end systolic
volume increases. Clinical heart failure occurs if 25% of myocardium has abnormal contraction, and
cardiogenic shock occurs on loss of >40% of LV myocardium. Decreased compliance and increased LV end
diastolic pressure give rise to diastolic dysfunction.
Classification
Myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, and acute coronary
syndrome
The term myocardial injury is used when there is evidence of elevated cardiac troponin values with at least
one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. If there is a rise and/or fall of the troponin values,
the injury is considered to be acute.[2]
Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions, including patients presenting with recent
changes in clinical symptoms or signs, with or without changes on 12-lead ECG and with or without acute
elevations in cardiac troponin (cTn) concentrations.[3]
The term myocardial infarction (MI) refers to acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute
myocardial ischemia (elevated cardiac troponin values with at least one value above the 99th percentile
upper reference limit) and at least one of the following:[2]
• Symptoms of myocardial ischemia
• New ischemic ECG changes
• Development of pathologic Q wave
• Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new wall motion abnormality
• Identification of coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy
MI caused by atherothrombotic coronary artery disease is designated as type 1 MI. Based on ECG changes,
these may be further characterized as STEMI or non-STEMI (NSTEMI).
Classically acute coronary syndrome has been divided into three clinical categories according to the
presence or absence of ST-segment elevation on presenting ECG, and on elevations of myocardial
biomarkers such as troponin.[2] [4]
1. STEMI: ECG shows persistent ST-segment elevation in two or more anatomically contiguous leads.

2. NSTEMI: ECG does not show ST-segment elevation, but cardiac biomarkers are elevated. The ECG may
show nonspecific ischemic changes such as ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion.
3. Unstable angina pectoris: nonspecific ischemic ECG changes, but cardiac biomarkers are normal.
To reflect the pathophysiologic continuum between NSTEMI and unstable angina, the American Heart
Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines have grouped these conditions under the single term
"non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes."[5]
In the contemporary setting, MI can also be classified according to variations in pathologic, clinical, and
prognostic factors, alongside the different management strategies recommended for each type.[1] [2]
• Acute MI (types 1, 2, and 3 MI)
• Defined as acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with
detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin values with at least one value >99th percentile
of the upper reference limit (URL)
• A type 1 MI is characterized by identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography (or
autopsy)
• Includes STEMI and NSTEMI
• In type 2 MI there is evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand
that is not associated with an acute atherothrombotic event
• Includes vasospasm, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and nonatherosclerotic
coronary dissection
• A type 3 MI is cardiac death in a patient with symptoms of myocardial ischemia and new
ischemic ECG changes prior to a cardiac troponin level becoming abnormal or available
• Coronary procedure-related MI (types 4 and 5 MI)
• Type 4a MI - related to percutaneous coronary intervention
• Type 4b MI - related to stent thrombosis
• Type 4c MI - related to stent restenosis
• Type 5 MI - related to coronary artery bypass graft surgery
Case history
Case history #1
A 54-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and family
history of premature coronary artery disease presents with retrosternal crushing chest pain (10/10 in
intensity), radiating down the left arm and left side of the neck. He feels nauseated and lightheaded and
is short of breath. Examination reveals a hypotensive, diaphoretic man in considerable discomfort with
diffuse bilateral rales on chest auscultation. ECG reveals convex ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V6.
Case history #2
A 70-year-old woman is 2 days postoperative for knee replacement surgery. Her past medical history
includes type 2 diabetes and a 40 pack-year history of smoking. She reports feeling suddenly ill

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
All patients presenting to hospital with chest pain should be urgently evaluated and cardiac and noncardiac
causes differentiated. History, examination, and initiation of therapy need to be done simultaneously.
History
A description of the chest pain (i.e., onset, nature, location, radiation, intensity, duration, associated
features) and an enquiry about any associated symptoms or major risk factors for coronary artery disease
(e.g., hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, chronic renal insufficiency, smoking) are essential.
Other risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) include male sex, advanced age, and cocaine use in
younger people.
Classically the pain is described as diffuse, severe, "heavy" or "crushing," located centrally in the chest,
with radiation to the left arm or jaw and occurring at rest. However, it may be nonclassic by location (i.e.,
epigastric, jaw, arm, neck pain) or by nature (i.e., burning, throbbing, recent-onset indigestion [particularly
if unrelated to meals], sharp or pleuritic chest pain, uneasiness).[67]
Associated features such as nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, palpitations, weakness, dizziness,
lightheadedness, confusion, or vague abdominal symptoms are more frequent among patients with
diabetes and in women and older people.[67] Some patients can present with only these symptoms and
without chest pain.
Physical exam
The clinical picture of acute MI is variable and no signs are specific to this condition. On general
inspection, patients are typically distressed, diaphoretic, tachycardic and appear pale or gray. Rales on
lung exam suggest heart failure. An audible S3 or S4 on cardiac exam indicates poor cardiac muscle
compliance of the infarcted muscle.
Alternatively, the patient may be in cardiogenic shock with a decreasing level of consciousness, profound
hypotension, acute shortness of breath, and imminent cardiac arrest.
Investigations
ECG should be ordered as early as possible (i.e., within 10 minutes of presentation).[67][68] If
presentation is outside of the hospital, a prehospital ECG should be obtained as early as possible and
sent to the receiving hospital.[3] [69] Serial ECGs should be checked in patients with a normal initial
ECG if there is a high clinical suspicion for myocardial ischemia.[2] [67] If the ECG shows ST-segment
elevation, the patient should be urgently assessed for reperfusion therapy.[69] ST depression in two or
more leads V1-V4 should be strongly considered as a posterior STEMI.

The definitive diagnostic test for STEMI is coronary angiography. Angiography can lead to immediate
treatment as the vessel can often be opened and stented at the same procedure. If angiography is not
immediately available, a further history should be taken to exclude contraindications to thrombolysis.
Do not use coronary CT angiography in high-risk emergency department patients presenting with acute
chest pain. Randomized controlled trials evaluating coronary CT angiography to diagnose coronary
artery disease have been limited to those patients with acute chest pain at low or low-intermediate risk of
ischemic events or mortality. Early CT may, however, be considered to rule out diagnoses such as aortic
dissection or pulmonary embolism.[3] [70]
Cardiac biomarkers (e.g., cardiac-specific troponins) should be ordered on presentation for any patient
with chest pain and risk factors. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are preferred.[67] [68] Cardiac troponin
levels remain elevated for around 10 days, which can make it difficult to determine the time of myocardial
injury.[71] Patients with elevated troponin levels have a worse prognosis than those with normal troponin
levels.[72] [73] Alternative causes for raised troponin levels should also be considered. These may
be cardiac (e.g., myocarditis, aortic dissection, severe heart failure) or noncardiac (e.g., pulmonary
embolism, impaired renal function, underlying sepsis).[74] It is important to remember that even with an
alternative underlying cause, raised troponin may still indicate myocardial injury. Creatine kinase-MB
fraction (CK-MB) and myoglobin are less sensitive and less specific and should not be ordered in the
diagnosis of STEMI.[2] [3][75] [76]
A basic metabolic panel and complete blood count should also be performed, and serum glucose and
lipids should be measured. Cholesterol levels may be lowered by high catecholamine levels produced by
the MI in its early phases, and serum lipids should therefore be repeated in 30-60 days.[77] [78]
Do not delay coronary reperfusion treatment to wait for blood results.[3]
Arterial blood gases should only be checked when there is severe dyspnea, hypoxia, and/or clinical
evidence of pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock, and in survivors of cardiac arrest.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
Chest x-ray (with a portable machine) is done to exclude other diagnoses, such as aortic dissection, and
to look for evidence of heart failure.[67][68] 
Point-of-care transthoracic echocardiogram can be used to:
• Look for regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle in patients with an atypical
presentation or equivocal ECG[79] [80]
• Assess the patient’s eligibility for coronary reperfusion therapy in the event of a delayed
presentation
• In practice, however, the patient's clinical status and the presence of pathologic Q waves
in the ECG are usually enough to assess their eligibility for coronary reperfusion therapy if
presentation is delayed
• Look for mechanical complications of acute MI, particularly in hemodynamically unstable patients[2]
[79]
• Left ventricular function
• Right ventricular function
• Ventricular septal rupture
• Left ventricular free wall rupture
• Acute mitral regurgitation
• Pericardial effusion
• Cardiac tamponade.
An echocardiogram can also be used to:
• Exclude STEMI in patients who present with global saddle-shaped ST-segment elevation (as seen
with acute pericarditis).[79]
• Confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (usually after normal coronary arteries are
found on a STEMI angiogram).[2] [79]
• Suggest alternative etiologies associated with chest pain (e.g., acute aortic disease, pulmonary
embolism).[3] [79]
A predischarge echocardiogram is indicated for all patients post-acute MI to assess left ventricular
function after coronary reperfusion therapy.[69][79] [80]
It is important to remember that imaging/other tests must not delay coronary reperfusion therapy.[79]
Do not perform stress tests in patients with acute chest pain and high probability of acute coronary
syndrome. A stress test, such as cardiac MRI stress test, can increase risk and delay treatment in
patients with acute chest pain and markers of high risk, such as ST segment elevation and/or positive
cardiac biomarkers.[81]
Emerging investigations
Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC)
CMyC is a cardiac-restricted protein that is released more rapidly than cardiac troponin after acute MI.
CMyC is also more abundant than cardiac troponins. CMyC may perform better than cardiac troponin T or
I in patients who present early after symptom onset.[82] It may become the gold standard test for the early
diagnosis of acute MI, though is not currently used in clinical practice.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Risk stratification
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend the use of validated
chest pain risk scores as part of standardized clinical decision pathways to determine which patients
require further investigation, particularly in settings where high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are not
available.[67] [68]
Risk scoring systems provide a summative assessment of the risk of a patient experiencing a major
adverse cardiovascular event, or death, within the next 30 days from presentation with a possible acute
coronary syndrome.[67] They combine troponin levels with other clinical information, such as age, ST
segment changes on ECG, symptoms, and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors. Urgent diagnostic
testing for suspected CAD is not needed for patients deemed low risk.[67]
Examples of validated risk scores include the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score and
the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk model.[5]
Do not order a coronary artery calcium (CAC) test in patients with known atherosclerotic disease,
including those with stents and bypass grafts, as this offers limited incremental prognostic value for these
individuals.[70] [84] [85]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
chest pain (common)
• Classically presents with retrosternal, crushing, heavy, diffuse, severe chest pain that can occur at
rest or with exertion, is heavy in nature, and is located centrally with radiation to the left arm or jaw.
The pain may be described by the patient as '‘pressing’' or ‘'squeezing.’. The pain may be constant or
intermittent, or wax and wane intensity, and lasts for at least 20 minutes.[2] [74] It is essential to clarify
the time of symptoms onset, as this will inform the appropriate reperfusion strategy.[3] [86] [87]
dyspnea (common)
• Dyspnea is a common feature secondary to pulmonary congestion from left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.[3]
• It can also occur due to other mechanical and electrical complications of acute MI, which occur less
commonly in the context of contemporary rapid revascularization, for example:
• • Left ventricular aneurysm
• Ventricular septal rupture
• Left ventricular free wall rupture
• Acute mitral regurgitation
• Papillary muscle rupture
• Functional (ischemic) mitral regurgitation
• Pericardial effusion
• Cardiac tamponade
• Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias
• Ventricular tachyarrhythmias

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
• Bradycardia and atrioventricular block
pallor (common)
• Pallor is a common feature associated with myocardial infarction due to high sympathetic output
resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction.
diaphoresis (common)
• Common feature associated with myocardial infarction due to high sympathetic output.[3] [88]
cardiogenic shock (uncommon)
• Associated with reduced consciousness, profound hypotension, acute shortness of breath, and
imminent cardiac arrest. Cardiogenic shock complicates 5% to 10% of STEMI admissions.[89] [90] In-
hospital mortality remains high (≥50%).[89] There is a bimodal presentation: the majority occur within
24 hours; the remainder occur within the first week.[90] [91]
Other diagnostic factors
additional heart sounds (common)
• Muffled heart sounds could suggest a pericardial effusion or even cardiac tamponade. An audible S3
or S4 on cardiac exam indicates poor cardiac muscle compliance of the infarcted muscle and severe
heart failure. A murmur might suggest acute ventricular septal defect, acute mitral regurgitation or
underlying chronic valvular heart disease.
nausea and/or vomiting (common)
• Common feature associated with myocardial infarction (MI).[3] Nonspecific for MI, but commonly
associated with inferior-wall MI due to increased vagal tone, and can be the only indicator of inferior-
wall MI.
dizziness or lightheadedness (common)
• Feeling lightheaded or weak/lethargic is a common feature associated with myocardial infarction due to
cerebral hypoperfusion as a result of hypotension and/or symptomatic bradycardia.
distress and anxiety (common)
• Common feature associated with myocardial infarction.
• Patients often report a sense of doom or death.
palpitations (common)
• Palpitations may be due to:[3] [92]
• Tachycardia
• • Common feature associated with myocardial infarction (MI), especially anterior-wall MI, due to
high sympathetic output.
• Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation
• Ventricular tachyarrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia
• Bradycardia
• • Sinus bradycardia
• Atrioventricular block secondary to inferior STEMI

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Atrioventricular block secondary to anterior STEMI
• Irregular heart beat
• • Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation
• Ventricular extrasystoles
abnormal breath sounds (uncommon)
• Rales, crackles/crepitations or cardiac wheeze on lung exam could suggest heart failure ± pulmonary
edema.
reduced consciousness (uncommon)
• Associated with cardiogenic shock or bradycardia and hypotension.[89][90] [93]
hypotension (uncommon)
• Hypotension may be present in cardiogenic shock, inferior STEMI, right ventricular infarction, cardiac
tamponade or hemodynamically significant atrioventricular block, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, or
ventricular arrhythmias.[89] [90] [93][94]
nonclassic location or nature of pain (chest pain-equivalent symptoms)
(uncommon)
• Pain may be atypical by location (i.e., epigastric, jaw, arm, neck pain) or by nature (i.e., burning,
throbbing, uneasiness), and some people present without chest pain as the predominant feature (i.e.,
with chest pain-equivalent symptoms).[3]
• Women, older patients, and patients with diabetes are more likely to present with atypical features.[3]
[95]
• Patients might describe their chest symptoms as burning, throbbing, tight, or a feeling like trapped
wind, the patient may even describe indigestion rather than chest pain. In the absence of chest pain,
there may be epigastric pain, back (interscapular) pain, neck or jaw pain, or arm pain (typically left-
sided). Clinical suspicion is key to making the diagnosis. It is, therefore, vital to make a full assessment
based on the history, exam, and serial ECGs.[2] [67][96]
Risk factors
Strong
smoking
• Smoking causes nearly 1 in 5 deaths in the US and is the single most important modifiable risk
factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).[13] [14] Cigarette smokers are substantially more likely than
nonsmokers to develop coronary artery disease (CAD), to have a stroke, and to develop peripheral
vascular disease, and are at increased risk of fatal and nonfatal recurrences of these diseases.[8] [9]
[13] Smoking increases risk for CAD by direct promotion of atherosclerosis, reduced oxygen delivery
in the blood, increased thrombogenesis, and direct coronary artery spasm.[15] Even mild and passive
smoking, and exposure to environmental tobacco, is associated with increased risk; risk increases
further as the number of cigarettes smoked per day increases.[8] [9][14][16] [17] Current use of
smokeless tobacco also increases the risk of CAD compared to people who have never used.[9][14]

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
• Patients who quit smoking reduce their risk of recurrent CVD by about one third, compared to patients
who do not quit smoking.[18]
• Surprisingly, current smoking is associated with a lower risk of acute death in the setting of acute
coronary syndrome.[5] This is referred to as the ''smoker's paradox'' and reflects the tendency for
smokers to develop thrombi on less severe plaques and at an earlier age than nonsmokers.
hypertension
• Hypertension is a major risk factor for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and for poor outcomes in
patients with ACS. About 69% of people who have a first myocardial infarction (MI) have blood
pressure (BP) >140/90 mmHg.[3] Hypertension is one of the most prevalent risk factors for coronary
artery disease in the US; approximately 30% of Americans have BP >140/90 mmHg, placing them
at greater risk of MI, and of poor outcomes in the event of ACS.[3] [5][19] [20] Even prehypertension
(untreated systolic blood pressure 120-139 mmHg and untreated diastolic blood pressure 80-89
mmHg, or both) increases risk twofold compared with normal levels.[9] High BP induces ventricular
hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction/damage and promotes atherosclerosis, all of which
predispose patients to cardiac events. By increasing cardiac after-load and myocardial oxygen
consumption, uncontrolled hypertension can contribute to and worsen anginal symptoms.
• Effective treatment of hypertension dramatically reduces the risk of cerebrovascular events, heart
failure, and future MI.[3]
diabetes
• Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).[5] They have
a two- to fourfold increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who do not have
diabetes.[21]
• The mechanisms are not fully known but they may reflect vascular abnormalities of inflammation,
endothelial and smooth muscle function, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypercoagulability.
CAD accounts for 75% of all deaths in the diabetic population.[5] Diabetes is associated with more
extensive CAD, unstable lesions, and less favorable long-term outcomes (death, MI, acute coronary
syndrome readmission), with approximately double the risk of long-term mortality from CAD than that
of people without diabetes following MI.[5][19]
• An HbA1c of <7% (53 mmol/mol) is the goal of treatment for many patients with diabetes, but targets
should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, and other factors.[22]
obesity and metabolic syndrome
• Estimates suggest that more than half of adults in Western society are overweight or obese.[9] [23]
[24] Adipokines and other hormones secreted by adipose tissue are highly linked to inflammation and
atherosclerosis.[25] Obesity is associated with diastolic dysfunction and is a strong stimulus for left
ventricular hypertrophy.[26] [27] It is also associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, through several
mechanisms including insulin resistance and inflammation.[28] Obesity and the metabolic phenotype
(abdominal obesity with known history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance)
predispose to coronary artery disease, and increase cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.[5] [9]
[24][26] [29] Bariatric surgery for weight loss reduces risk of major cardiovascular events (fatal acute
coronary syndrome and stroke), incident heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality.[30]
sedentary behavior and physical inactivity
• Sedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[9] Epidemiologic
studies suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between phyisical activity and cardiorespiratory

fitness and reduced cardiovascular mortality.[31] The relative risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)
associated with physical inactivity ranges from 1.5 to 2.4, an increase comparable to that for high
cholesterol, high BP, and cigarette smoking.[32] Physical activity has antiatherosclerotic, psychologic,
antithrombotic, anti-ischemic, and antiarrhythmic effects that are important in primary and secondary
prevention of CAD.[31] Regular exercise increases cardiorespiratory fitness and lowers myocardial
oxygen demand.[33] Sustained, regular physical activity lowers BP, reduces lipid levels, reduces
adiposity, increases insulin sensitivity, and decreases inflammation, stress, and adrenergic activity.[34]
In patients with CAD, there is a direct correlation between the volume of moderate to vigorous physical
activity and reduction in cardiovascular risk and mortality.[35] [36]
dyslipidemia
• Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, decreased high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), and elevated ratio of LDL to HDL are all independently associated with increased
risk of atherosclerosis.[37]
• There is a linear relationship between reduction in LDL-cholesterol and risk of myocardial infarction or
other major vascular events; absolute risk reduction of major vascular events depend on the baseline
risk of cardiovascular events and degree of LDL-cholesterol lowering.[38]
• In postmenopausal women, dysfunctional HDL may mean that high HDL levels (usually considered
protective) are also associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis.[39]
• Lipid-lowering therapy reduces future ischemic events and limits disease progression.[3] [5][40][41]
 Current guidelines recommend high-dose statin therapy in patients with known coronary artery
disease (CAD) or CAD equivalent, irrespective of LDL levels.[3] [42] Other lipid-lowering treatments
can be considered in patients who are contraindicated or intolerant of statins. Reduction of lipoprotein
levels, with drugs such as alirocumab, reduces risk of cardiovascular events following acute coronary
syndrome.[43]
chronic kidney disease
• Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with acute coronary syndrome have chronic kidney disease
(CKD).[3] [44] Excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with CKD is caused, at least in
part, by higher prevalence of traditional risk factors in this group; there is a very high prevalence
of comorbid CVDs in patients with CKD, ranging from ischemic heart disease to arrhythmias and
venous thromboembolism.[9] Decreasing glomerular filtration rate is associated with increasing risk of
cardiovascular events, including death.[5][45]
atherosclerosis (history of angina, MI, stroke, transient ischemic attack,
peripheral vascular disease)
• Atherosclerotic heart disease is the underlying mechanism in coronary artery disease (CAD). It
evolves over decades and can begin in childhood. One study found intimal lesions in the aorta in all
those ages 15-19 years, and in the right coronary artery in more than half of those of this age.[46]
 Atherosclerosis is typically silent until an acute event occurs (e.g., acute coronary syndrome [ACS]).
A sedentary lifestyle, excess caloric intake, and cigarette smoking are strongly associated with
atherosclerosis. In an acute setting, the presence or absence of the traditional risk factors for CAD are
not specific or sensitive for diagnosing ACS. However, they do appear to be important in determining
prognosis in ACS and targeting secondary prevention strategies.[5]
• Longstanding angina pectoris is a risk factor for coronary events.[47] Presence of peripheral arterial
disease increases the likelihood of associated coronary atherosclerosis.[5]

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
family history of premature#CAD
• Defined as premature coronary artery disease in family members (men <50 years; women <55
years).[48] Family history includes a first-degree relative with a history of MI, sudden cardiac death,
aortic dissection, PCI, or coronary artery bypass graft. Inherited (primary) disorders of lipoprotein
metabolism are an important cause, though other genetic variants may also play a role.[49] On
physical exam, patients may have eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis (lipid accumulation within
retinal vessels), or tendinous xanthomas. In the acute setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
presence or absence of family history does not help in treatment, but presence of family history
increases the probability of ACS, and is associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiac events in
patients with ACS.[5] 
age >60 years
• Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is more common in older patients; the majority of patients presenting
with ACS are >65 years (median age 68 years).[5] Patients with NSTEMI are often older than patients
with STEMI; half of patients with NSTEMI are 70 years old or older, whereas half of those with STEMI
are 64 years old or younger.[50] The mean age of patients presenting with STEMI is 60 years for men
and 71 years for women.[51]
cocaine use
• Cocaine accounts for up to 25% of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in people ages 18-45 years.[52] In
the hour after cocaine is used, the risk of MI is 24 times the baseline risk.[53] This is probably due to
cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm and thrombosis, in addition to a direct effect on heart rate and
arterial pressure. Cocaine also has direct myocardial toxic properties.[5]
depression
• An independent predictor of future myocardial infarction in otherwise healthy people.[54] [55]
stent thrombosis or restenosis
• Stent thrombosis or in-stent restenosis may cause STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina. Both stent
thrombosis and restenosis have complex causes, triggers, pathophysiology, and risk factors. Of
importance, premature cessation of antiplatelet agents in patients with stents (drug-eluting and bare-
metal) may trigger an acute coronary syndrome.[3] [5]
sleep apnea
• Untreated moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with a 17%
increase in relative risk of cardiovascular events compared to risk in patients without OSA.[56] Patients
with preexisting OSA are at increased risk of further cardiac events following acute coronary syndrome
compared to patients who do not have OSA.[57] [58]
Weak
migraine
• People with migraine are more likely to have acute coronary syndrome and have higher rates of
cardiovascular mortality.[59] It is unclear whether this is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, or due to higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with migraine.[59]

12-Lead ECG with ST-segment elevation
in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF)
From the personal collection of Dr Mahi Ashwath; used with permission
• Leads are left in place to help with comparison for subsequent ECGs.
Serial ECGs should be obtained every 5 to 10 minutes in patients
with high clinical suspicion and initial normal ECG.[2] [67][69]
• In patients with inferior STEMI, right-sided ECG leads should be
obtained to screen for ST elevation, as right ventricular infarction is
present in 40% of inferior infarcts.[98]
cardiac biomarkers
• Cardiac biomarkers are ordered on presentation for any patient with
chest pain and risk factors.
• Troponins are highly specific for myocardial damage and will be
elevated around 4-6 hours after injury. High-sensitivity cardiac
troponins are preferred.[67] [68] They remain elevated for around 10
days, which can make it difficult to determine the time of myocardial
injury.[71] Patients with elevated troponin levels have a worse
prognosis than those with normal troponin levels.[72] [73] Alternative
causes for raised troponin levels should also be considered. These
may be cardiac (e.g., myocarditis, aortic dissection, severe heart
failure) or noncardiac (e.g., pulmonary embolism, impaired renal
function, underlying sepsis).[74]
• Creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) and myoglobin are less
sensitive and less specific and should not be ordered in the diagnosis
of STEMI.[2] [3] [67] [75] [76]
elevated troponin
blood glucose
• Determines if any treatment for glucose abnormalities is necessary.
• Hyperglycemia is common in the setting of acute MI, with or without a
history of diabetes, and is associated with mortality.[3] [99] Follow-up
is needed to determine if a diagnosis of diabetes exists after an acute
MI episode.
normal or elevated
complete blood count
• Detects anemia, which may affect the duration of dual antiplatelet
therapy prescribed. Raised inflammatory markers may be a direct
result of the acute-phase response to acute coronary syndrome or
may point to concomitant infection.
• Do not delay coronary reperfusion treatment to wait for blood
results.[3]

C-reactive protein (CRP)
• May be raised as a direct result of the acute-phase response to

• Not useful in the acute period of STEMI management but will
inform assessment of the patient’s risk factor profile for recurrent

levels produced by the MI in its early phases, and serum lipids should
therefore be repeated in 30-60 days.[77] [78]

Test to avoid
Recommendations Rationale
coronary artery calcium (CAC)
• Do not order a CAC test in patients with known atherosclerotic
disease, including those with stents and bypass grafts.[70] [84] [85]
• A CAC test offers
limited incremental
prognostic value for
individuals with an
established diagnosis
of coronary artery
disease.[70] [84]
coronary CT angiography
• Do not use coronary CT angiography in high-risk emergency
department patients presenting with acute chest pain.[3] [70]
• Use may delay
treatment.
Randomized
controlled trials
evaluating coronary
CT angiography to
diagnose CAD have
been limited to those
patients with acute
chest pain at low or
low-intermediate risk
of ischemic events
or mortality. Early
CT may, however, be
considered to rule
out diagnoses such
as aortic dissection
or pulmonary
embolism.[3] [70]
stress test
• Do not perform stress tests in patients with acute chest pain and high
probability of acute coronary syndrome.[81]
• A stress test, such as
cardiac MRI stress
test, can increase risk
and delay treatment
in patients with
acute chest pain and
markers of high risk,
such as ST segment
elevation and/or
positive cardiac
biomarkers.[81]

arterial blood gas (ABG)
• ABGs should only be checked when there is severe dyspnea,
hypoxia, and/or clinical evidence of pulmonary edema or cardiogenic
shock, and in survivors of cardiac arrest.
• Patients may require airway stabilization and oxygen supplementation
before proceeding to primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
• This should not be performed routinely and must not delay coronary
reperfusion therapy if there is no current or impending objective
respiratory compromise.
• Taking an ABG may cause trauma to the radial artery, which is
typically the access point for coronary angiography.
oxygen is indicated
when: arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO₂) <90% or
PaO₂ <60 mmHg (<7.9 kPa)
CXR
• Patients with STEMI should have a portable CXR, but this should not
delay implementation of reperfusion therapy.[67][68] [69]
• Used to exclude possible alternative diagnosis of cause of chest pain
and to assess current cardiac functioning.[68]
• Widened mediastinum suggests aortic dissection. Pulmonary edema
indicates impaired cardiac function.
normal
echocardiogram
• Point-of-care transthoracic echocardiogram can be used to:
• • Look for regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle
in patients with an atypical presentation or equivocal ECG[79]
• Assess the patient’s eligibility for coronary reperfusion therapy
in the event of a delayed presentation
• In practice, however, the patient's clinical status and the
presence of pathologic Q waves in the ECG are usually
enough to assess their eligibility for coronary reperfusion
therapy if presentation is delayed
• Look for mechanical complications of acute MI, particularly in
hemodynamically unstable patients:[2] [79]
• Left ventricular function
• Right ventricular function
• Ventricular septal rupture
• Left ventricular free wall rupture
• Acute mitral regurgitation
• Pericardial effusion
• Cardiac tamponade
• An echocardiogram can also be used to:
• • Exclude STEMI in patients who present with global
saddle-shaped ST-segment elevation (as seen with acute
pericarditis).[79]
• Confirm the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (usually
after normal coronary arteries are found on a STEMI
angiogram).[2] [79]

cardiac myosin-binding protein C (CMyC)
• CMyC is a cardiac-restricted protein that is released more rapidly
than cardiac troponin after acute MI. CMyC is also more abundant
than cardiac troponins. CMyC may perform better than cardiac
troponin T or I in patients who present early after symptom onset.[82] 
It may become the gold standard test for the early diagnosis of acute
MI, though it is not currently used in clinical practice.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Criteria
ST changes on ECG[2] [4]
New or presumed new ST-segment elevation at the J point in 2 or more contiguous leads with the cutoff
points of ≥1 mm in all leads other than V2, or V3, where the following cutoff points apply:
• ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years old
• ≥2 mm in men >40 years old
• ≥1.5 mm in women regardless of age
New horizontal or downsloping ST-depression ≥0.5 mm in two contiguous leads and/or T-wave inversion >1
mm in two contiguous leads with prominent R wave or R/S ratio >1. Note: ST depressions in leads V1-V4
should be considered as a posterior STEMI.
New or presumed new left bundle branch block (LBBB) in patients with coronary ischemia may be
associated with poor prognosis. More importantly, the presence of LBBB on baseline ECG may confound the
diagnosis of STEMI. In patients with new left bundle branch block, ≥1mm concordant ST-segment elevation
may be an indicator of myocardial ischemia.
Criteria for acute, evolving, or recent myocardial infarction[2] [4]
Either one of the following criteria:
1. Typical rise of biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (e.g., troponin) with at least one of the following:
• Ischemic symptoms
• Development of pathologic Q waves on ECG
• ECG changes indicative of ischemia (ST-segment elevation or depression)
• Coronary artery intervention (e.g., coronary angiography).
2. Pathologic findings of acute myocardial infarction (MI).
Criteria for established MI[2] [4]
Any one of the following:
1. Development of pathologic Q waves on serial ECGs. The patient may or may not remember previous
symptoms. Biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis may have normalized, depending on the length of
time that has passed since the infarct developed.
2. Pathologic findings of a healed or healing MI.
3. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with the delayed enhancement imaging showing a classic
subendocardial or transmural infarct in a coronary artery distribution.
Screening
Patients should be evaluated for major cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes,
dyslipidemia, smoking, and renal disease periodically every 4-6 years.[14]

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The main goals of treatment are to limit myocardial damage by restoring myocardial blood flow as quickly as
possible and to decrease subsequent remodeling, which can have deleterious effects on ventricular function
and prognosis.[69] [87]
Immediate and prompt revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 minutes
of first presentation, or thrombolysis within 12 hours of symptom onset, can prevent or decrease myocardial
damage and decrease morbidity and mortality by preventing acute complications.[69] [106] [107] It is
strongly recommended that local communities or regional areas should develop a rapid response system for
treatment of STEMI. The optimal coronary revascularization strategy may not be clear for all patients with
STEMI (e.g., if there is complex coronary disease and/or comorbid conditions); this is more likely to apply to
older patients.[108]
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend a patient-centered
shared decision-making process for such patients, utilizing a multidisciplinary team that includes
representatives from interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, and clinical cardiology.[67] [106][108]
Initial management
The patient should be admitted to a unit with continuous cardiac monitoring and started on strict bed
rest for the first 12-24 hours. Supplemental oxygen may be administered if oxygen saturation is less
than 90%.[3][69] Liberal use of oxygen is associated with increased mortality in patients with acute
coronary syndrome.[109] [110] Guidelines recommend that oxygen should not be routinely administered
in normoxic patients with suspected or confirmed acute coronary syndrome (ACS).[3][69][74]
Aspirin is given immediately.
Adequate analgesia with morphine is essential to relieve pain and its related sympathetic activity, which
can further increase myocardial oxygen demand.
Nitroglycerin should also be given immediately, if the patient is not hypotensive, as it reduces myocardial
oxygen demand and lessens ischemia, and may rarely abort MI if there is coronary spasm. However, it
should not be given in doses that interfere with analgesic therapy. Sublingual dosing should be given first
to all patients, while intravenous therapy is reserved for patients with hypertension or heart failure.
Hemodynamically unstable
Cardiogenic shock occurs in 5% to 10% of people presenting with STEMI, and the in-hospital mortality is
≥50%.[89] [90]
If revascularization with PCI fails or is not feasible, urgent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is
recommended for patients with cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability.[89] [90] [106]
Patients with low cardiac output states and cardiogenic shock may benefit from a dobutamine
infusion.[89] [90] Guidelines state that adjunctive use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or a
ventricular mechanical circulatory support device may be reasonable in selected patients at risk of
hemodynamic compromise during PCI (e.g., in patients with severe peripheral artery or aortic disease).
[89] [90] [106] Results from observational studies appear to be conflicting for IABP in acute MI, and in
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) it has not been shown to reduce mortality after acute MI even in
patients with cardiogenic shock.[111]

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy
• Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents are indicated for the treatment of STEMI as they limit
secondary thrombosis by inhibiting platelet activation and subsequent platelet aggregation.
• Aspirin should be given to all patients, along with ticagrelor or prasugrel.[3] [112]  Prasugrel and
ticagrelor are associated with reduced ischemic events compared to clopidogrel, though there is
also an increased bleeding risk with these agents.[113] [114] [115] Prasugrel is contraindicated
in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, and its use is not
recommended in patients >75 years of age or in patients with low body weight (<60 kg) due to
increased bleeding risk (though dose reductions may mitigate this risk); therefore, ticagrelor is often
more widely used.[69] [106][116] [117] Ticagrelor may be associated with higher risk of bleeding
and death than clopidogrel in older patients.[118] Clopidogrel is an alternative P2Y12 inhibitor
that may be used when ticagrelor and prasugrel are contraindicated or unavailable.[3] [118]
 Cangrelor, an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, can be used as an adjunct to PCI to reduce the risk of
periprocedural MI, repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis in patients who have not
previously been treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being treated with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
inhibitor.[3] [119]
• Unfractionated heparin is the preferred anticoagulant to be used as a single agent in addition to
antiplatelet therapy. Alternatively, bivalirudin and enoxaparin can be used.[3] Additional glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors) are only recommended if there is evidence of slow flow, no-
reflow, or a thrombotic complication at PCI.[3] [106]
Supportive measures
• Adequate analgesia with morphine is essential to relieve pain and its related sympathetic activity,
which can further increase myocardial oxygen demand.
• Supplemental oxygen may be administered if oxygen saturation is less than 90%.[3] [69] Guidelines
recommend that oxygen should not be routinely administered in normoxic patients with suspected
or confirmed ACS.[3] [69][74]
• Glycemic control, including the use of insulin where appropriate, should also be maintained,
although rigid control has not been shown to be beneficial in critically ill patients.[22]
Electrically unstable: post-cardiac arrest
Emergency revascularization is recommended in patients with a cardiac arrest who have been
resuscitated and are hemodynamically stable and show ECG evidence for a STEMI. Staged PCI of
a significant non-infarct artery stenosis is recommended after successful primary PCI in selected
hemodynamically stable patients with multivessel disease.[106] Alternatively, multivessel PCI may be
considered at the time of primary PCI in selected patients, although the evidence supporting this strategy
is weaker.[106] However, physicians should consider clinical data, lesion severity/complexity, and risk of
contrast nephropathy to determine the optimal PCI strategy (primary or staged). 
Emergency CABG is contraindicated in post-cardiac arrest patients who are comatose.
Thrombolysis is a potential option if PCI is not readily available, but prolonged CPR is a contraindication
to the use of thrombolytics.
Hypothermia is recommended for cardiac arrest patients who have been resuscitated and remain
comatose.

PCI
• Primary PCI, with stent placement (using bare metal stents or drug-eluting stents), is the preferred
method of revascularization, provided it can be performed in a timely manner with an experienced
team of operators. Primary PCI is recommended for patients presenting within 12 hours of
symptom onset and can be beneficial for patients presenting between 12 and 24 hours of symptom
onset, though is most effective when symptom-to-balloon times are minimized.[87] [106] [107][120]
[121] It involves immediate transfer to the catheterization laboratory with the intention of opening
the artery with stent placement. Drug-eluting stents are preferred.[3][122] [123] Third-generation
drug-eluting stents composed of biodegradable polymers are currently being investigated.[124]

• Radial approach is preferable to femoral approach as it results in better outcomes (e.g., reduction
in mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding, and bleeding complications),
particularly if the operator is experienced in radial access.[87] [106][126] [127] [128]
• Staged PCI of a significant non-infarct artery stenosis is recommended after successful primary
PCI in selected hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and multivessel disease.[106]
Alternatively, multivessel PCI may be considered at the time of primary PCI in selected patients,
although the evidence supporting this strategy is weaker.[106] [129] [130] [131] Physicians should
consider factors such as clinical data, hemodynamic stability, lesion severity/complexity, and risk
of contrast nephropathy to determine the optimal PCI strategy. Calculation of the SYNTAX score is
recommended for left main or multivessel PCI.  [SYNTAX score] (http://www.syntaxscore.org)
• Guidelines also recommend against routine manual aspiration thrombectomy before primary
PCI as the evidence does not suggest any benefit of this procedure over PCI alone.[106] [132]
Furthermore, studies have suggested that routine aspiration thrombectomy might increase the risk
of stroke.[133] [134]

• Many hospitals have 24-hour PCI capacity; however, in facilities without catheterization
laboratories, routine transfer to a PCI facility should be considered for all patients if transfer times
are reasonable and total ischemic time after presentation is less than 120 minutes.[106]
• Early revascularization prevents scar formation, decreases the occurrence of heart failure later on,
and decreases the incidence of future ventricular arrhythmias caused by scar formation.
CABG
• Emergency revascularization with CABG can be useful if PCI fails or is not feasible, and a large
area of myocardium is at risk.[106]
• CABG is recommended for patients with cardiogenic shock or heart failure if PCI is not feasible.[89]
[90] [106]
• CABG should not be undertaken after failed primary PCI in the absence of ischemia or a large area
of myocardium at risk, or if surgical revascularization is not feasible due to a no-reflow state or poor
distal targets.[106]
Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy
• Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents are indicated for the treatment of STEMI as they limit
secondary thrombosis by inhibiting platelet activation and subsequent platelet aggregation.
• Aspirin should be given to all patients, along with ticagrelor or prasugrel.[3] [112] Prasugrel and
ticagrelor are associated with reduced ischemic events compared to clopidogrel, though there is
also an increased bleeding risk with these agents.[113] [114] [115] Prasugrel is contraindicated
in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, and its use is not
recommended in patients >75 years of age or in patients with low body weight (<60 kg) due to
increased bleeding risk (though dose reductions may mitigate this risk); therefore, ticagrelor is
often more widely used.[69] [106][116] [117] Ticagrelor may be associated with higher risk of
bleeding and death than clopidogrel in older patients.[118] Clopidogrel is an alternative P2Y12
inhibitor that may be used when ticagrelor and prasugrel are contraindicated or unavailable.[3]
[118] Cangrelor, an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, can be used as an adjunct to PCI to reduce the
risk of periprocedural MI, repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis in patients who
have not previously been treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being treated with a GPIIb/IIIa
inhibitor.[3] [119]
• Unfractionated heparin is the preferred anticoagulant to be used as a single agent in addition to
antiplatelet therapy. Alternatively, bivalirudin and enoxaparin can be used. Additional glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors) are only recommended if there is evidence of slow flow, no-
flow, or a thrombotic complication at PCI.[106]
Supportive measures
• Oral beta-blockers should be started as soon as possible, as they decrease infarction size
and reduce mortality, although care should be taken in patients with evidence of heart failure,
hypotension, bradycardia, or asthma.[69] [135] [136] Intravenous beta-blockers are recommended
only in patients who are hypertensive or have ongoing ischemia, provided there are no
contraindications to their use.[69] [137]
• In the absence of contraindications, high-intensity statin therapy (i.e., statin regimens that reduce
LDL-cholesterol by ≥50%) should be initiated or continued in all stabilized patients with STEMI.[69]
[138] 
• Eplerenone should be added to optimal medical therapy in eligible patients (creatinine <2.5 mg/
dL in men and <2.0 mg/dL in women; potassium <5.0 mEq/L) 3-14 days after STEMI with ejection
fraction <0.40, and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes mellitus.[69] [139] Earlier initiation

of the drug (<7 days) has been shown to significantly reduce the rates of all-cause mortality,
sudden cardiac death, and cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization, whereas initiation >7 days has
not been shown to have a significant effect on outcomes.[140]
• Adequate analgesia with morphine is essential to relieve pain and its related sympathetic activity,
which can further increase myocardial oxygen demand. Nitroglycerin should also be given
immediately if the patient is not hypotensive.
• Supplemental oxygen may be administered if oxygen saturation is less than 90%.[3] [69] Guidelines
recommend that oxygen should not be routinely administered in normoxic patients with suspected
or confirmed ACS.[3] [69][74]
• Glycemic control, including the use of insulin where appropriate, should also be maintained,
although rigid control has not been shown to be beneficial in critically ill patients.[22]
• Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided, and stopped if possible in patients already
on them.[141]
Hemodynamically stable: PCI available >90 minutes after first
medical contact and within 12 hours of symptom onset with no
contraindications to thrombolysis
Thrombolysis is indicated if PCI is not available within 90 minutes of first medical contact and the patient
has no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.[142] [143] It should be initiated within 30 minutes of
presentation. Thrombolysis is used only once on initial diagnosis, and this must be within 12 hours
of symptom onset (ideally within 3 hours) as the efficacy of fibrinolytic agents in lysing the thrombus
diminishes over time. Therapy within the first 2 hours (particularly the first hour) can occasionally abort MI
and dramatically reduce mortality.[69]
Absolute contraindications for thrombolysis are any prior intracranial hemorrhage, known malignant
intracranial lesion or structural cerebral vascular lesion (e.g., arteriovenous malformations), ischemic
stroke within previous 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis, and
significant closed head or facial trauma within previous 3 months.[69]
Thrombolytics can be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, in addition to the risk associated with
other antithrombotic and/or antiplatelet agents used, and can also cause intracranial hemorrhage.
Transfer to a PCI-capable hospital within 24 hours should be considered in all patients undergoing
fibrinolytic therapy. Angiography with intent to fully revascularize the culprit vessel should be considered
within 24 hours even after successful fibrinolytic therapy (i.e., treatment of residual stenosis or suboptimal
flow of the infarct artery).[87] [106][143]
Rescue PCI after thrombolysis is recommended in patients with evidence of failed reperfusion (such
as ongoing chest pain; hemodynamic, mechanical, or electrical instability; or shock). Treated patients
should be transferred for PCI as soon as possible after thrombolysis.[3] [144] Those transferred within 6
hours after thrombolytic therapy had significantly fewer ischemic complications than those who were only
transferred if they had complications.[145] Rescue PCI is associated with improved clinical outcomes after
failed fibrinolytic therapy.[146]
Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents (e.g., oral aspirin and clopidogrel; intravenous heparin) are
also indicated for the treatment of STEMI, as this limits secondary thrombosis by inhibiting platelet
activation and subsequent platelet aggregation. Prasugrel and ticagrelor are not recommended in
patients undergoing thrombolysis as they have not been adequately studied in this setting.[147] GPIIb/
IIIa inhibitors are not indicated in STEMI if thrombolytic therapy is indicated. Low molecular weight heparin

should be considered instead of unfractionated heparin in patients treated with thrombolysis.[3] [148]
[149]
Supportive measures are the same as those for patients who undergo PCI within 90 minutes.
Hemodynamically stable: PCI available >90 minutes after first
medical contact and within 12 hours of symptom onset with
contraindications to thrombolysis
In patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, PCI is indicated even if it cannot occur within 90
minutes. Patients should be transferred for PCI as soon as possible.
Antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents and supportive measures are the same as those for patients who
undergo PCI within 90 minutes.
Hemodynamically stable: no access to PCI within 90 minutes and
>12 hours after symptom onset
Even beyond 12 hours, if there are persistent symptoms, it is possible to obtain benefits from
revascularization, which would be best performed with percutaneous coronary revascularization. Stable
patients in whom PCI or thrombolysis is not indicated are treated with pharmacotherapy only, including
beta-blockers and antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. If the patient becomes unstable, they should
undergo late PCI, which can be done up to 36 hours after the onset of symptoms.[106] [150]
Routine primary PCI strategy should still be considered in patients presenting between 12 and 48 hours
after symptom onset. However, if the time since symptom onset is >48 hours and the patient is now
asymptomatic, routine PCI of an occluded infarct-related artery is not recommended.[3] [151]
Supportive measures are the same as those for patients who undergo PCI within 90 minutes.
Post-STEMI
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that, where
available, cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are provided for patients with STEMI,
particularly those with multiple modifiable risk factors and/or those moderate- to high-risk patients in
whom supervised exercise training is warranted.[152] [153] [154] [Evidence A]  Systematic review
evidence has shown exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation helps to improve outcomes in people with
coronary heart disease.[155]
Patients without any preexisting risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at increased risk
of early mortality; even patients who are deemed low risk require prompt initiation of evidence-based
pharmacotherapy post ACS.[156]
Dual antiplatelet therapy should usually be continued in all patients for at least 12 months, whether they
were stented or not.[69] [157] In selected patients undergoing PCI, shorter-duration dual antiplatelet
therapy (1-3 months) can be considered, with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy to
reduce the risk of bleeding events.[106] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162]
Statin therapy should be given indefinitely if tolerated and not contraindicated.[69] [138] For patients at
very high risk of future events, and those up to 75 years of age and not at very high risk, ezetimibe may
be added if the patient is on maximal statin therapy, and LDL-cholesterol level remains ≥70 mg/dL.[163]

may be added to maximal statin and ezetimibe therapy if the patient is at very high risk of future events
and LDL-cholesterol level remains ≥70 mg/dL, or non-HDL-cholesterol ≥100 mg/dL.[3] [43][163][164]
 Patients are considered to be at very high risk of future events if they have a history of multiple major
atherosclerotic CVD events (recent ACS [within the past 12 months], MI other than the recent ACS,
ischemic stroke, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease [claudication with ankle brachial index <0.85,
previous revascularization or amputation]), or one major atherosclerotic CVD event and multiple high
risk conditions (age ≥65 years, heterozygous family history, history of previous CABG or PCI, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, current smoking, persistently elevated LDL-cholesterol
[≥100 mg/dL {≥2.6 mmol/L}] despite maximally tolerated therapy, history of congestive heart failure).[163] 
ACE inhibitors should be started early (i.e., when patient is hemodynamically stable, optimally on first day
in the hospital) for a favorable effect on ventricular remodeling, especially in patients with large anterior
wall MI. Beta-blockers should be continued long term (>1 year) - continuing use should then be evaluated
on the basis of comorbidities.[135][165] [166] [167] The American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association recommend that the decision to continue beta-blockers long term after revascularization
should be made on an individualized basis.[106]
A sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, should be
given to patients with heart failure when they are clinically stable, regardless of their left ventricular
ejection fraction.[168] [169] [170]
Chronic nitrate use is not routinely recommended after a MI, but may be used as part of the treatment
plan for congestive heart failure and for chronic angina.

Treatment algorithm
Please note that formulations/routes and doses may differ between drug names and brands, drug
formularies, or locations. Treatment recommendations are specific to patient groups: see disclaimer
Initial
suspected myocardial infarction
1st aspirin
Primary options
» aspirin: 162-325 mg orally immediately,
followed by 75-162 mg once daily
» Patient should be admitted to a unit with
continuous cardiac monitoring and started on
strict bed rest for the first 12-24 hours.
» Aspirin is given immediately.
adjunct oxygen
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group

» Aspirin should be given to all patients, along
with ticagrelor or prasugrel.[3] [112] These
treatments limit secondary thrombosis by
inhibiting platelet activation and subsequent
platelet aggregation.
» Prasugrel and ticagrelor are associated
with reduced ischemic events compared to
clopidogrel, though there is also an increased
bleeding risk with these agents.[113] [114] [115]
 Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a
history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic
attack, and its use is not recommended in
patients >75 years of age or in patients with low
body weight (<60 kg) due to increased bleeding
risk (though dose reductions may mitigate this
risk); therefore, ticagrelor is often more widely
used.[69] [106][116] [117] Ticagrelor may be
associated with higher risk of bleeding and
death than clopidogrel in older patients.[118] 
Clopidogrel is an alternative P2Y12 inhibitor that
may be used when ticagrelor and prasugrel are
contraindicated or unavailable.[3] [118]
» Cangrelor, an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, can
be used as an adjunct to PCI to reduce the risk
of periprocedural myocardial infarction, repeat
coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis
in patients who have not previously been treated
with a P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being treated
with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.[3] [119]

evidence for a STEMI.
» Primary PCI with stent placement (using
bare metal stents or drug-eluting stents) is
the preferred method of revascularization.[69]
[120] [121] Drug-eluting stents are preferred.[3]
[122][123] Many hospitals have 24-hour
PCI capacity; however, in facilities without
catheterization laboratories, routine transfer
to a PCI facility should be considered for all
patients if transfer times are reasonable and
total ischemic time after presentation is less than
120 minutes.[106] Radial approach is preferable
to femoral approach as it results in better
outcomes (e.g., reduction in mortality, major
adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding,
and bleeding complications), particularly if the
operator is experienced in radial access.[87]

1st revascularization
» Primary PCI with stent placement (using
bare metal stents or drug-eluting stents) is the
preferred method of revascularization, provided
it can be performed in a timely manner with
an experienced team of operators. Primary
PCI is recommended for patients presenting
within 12 hours of symptom onset and can
be beneficial for patients presenting between
12 and 24 hours of symptom onset, though
is most effective when symptom-to-balloon
times are minimized.[87] [107][120] [121] It
involves immediate transfer to the catheterization
laboratory with the intention of opening the
artery with stent placement. Drug-eluting stents
are preferred.[3] [122][123] Many hospitals
have 24-hour PCI capacity; however, in facilities
without catheterization laboratories, routine
transfer to a PCI facility should be considered for
all patients if transfer times are reasonable and
total ischemic time after presentation is less than
120 minutes.[106] Radial approach is preferable
to femoral approach as it results in better
outcomes (e.g., reduction in mortality, major
adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding,
and bleeding complications) particularly if the
operator is experienced in radial access.[87]
[106][126] [127] [128]
» Staged PCI of a significant non-infarct artery
stenosis is recommended after successful
primary PCI in selected hemodynamically
stable patients with STEMI and multivessel
disease.[106] Alternatively, multivessel PCI
may be considered at the time of primary
PCI, although the evidence supporting this
strategy is weaker.[106] Physicians should
consider SYNTAX score and clinical data,
lesion severity/complexity, and risk of contrast
nephropathy to determine the optimal PCI
strategy (primary or staged).  [SYNTAX score]

» Emergency revascularization with CABG can
be useful if PCI fails or is not feasible and a
large area of myocardium is at risk.[106] It is

of ticagrelor and are not recommended if this
drug is used concomitantly.
-and-
» clopidogrel: 300-600 mg orally as a loading
dose, followed by 75 mg once daily
» Aspirin should be given to all patients, along
with ticagrelor or prasugrel.[3] [112] These
treatments limit secondary thrombosis by
inhibiting platelet activation and subsequent
platelet aggregation.
» Prasugrel and ticagrelor are associated
with reduced ischemic events compared to
clopidogrel, though there is also an increased
bleeding risk with these agents.[113] [114] [115]
 Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a
history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic
attack, and its use is not recommended in
patients >75 years of age or in patients with low
body weight (<60 kg) due to increased bleeding
risk (though dose reductions may mitigate this
risk); therefore, ticagrelor is often more widely
used.[69] [106][116] [117] Ticagrelor may be
associated with higher risk of bleeding and
death than clopidogrel in older patients.[118]
 Clopidogrel is an alternative P2Y12 inhibitor that
may be used when ticagrelor and prasugrel are
contraindicated or unavailable.[3] [118]
» Cangrelor, an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor, can
be used as an adjunct to PCI to reduce the risk
of periprocedural myocardial infarction, repeat
coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis
in patients who have not previously been treated
with a P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being treated
with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.[3] [119]

potassium <5.0 mEq/L) 3-14 days after
STEMI with ejection fraction <0.40, and

(<7 days) has been shown to significantly
reduce the rates of all-cause mortality, sudden
cardiac death, and cardiovascular mortality/
hospitalization, whereas initiation >7 days has
not been shown to have a significant effect on
outcomes.[140]
» Serum potassium levels should be monitored
regularly during therapy, especially during the
initiation of therapy.

» Should be initiated within 30 minutes of
presentation.
» Used only once on initial diagnosis, and
this must be within 12 hours of symptom
onset (ideally within 3 hours) as the efficacy
of fibrinolytic agents in lysing the thrombus
diminishes over time.
» Therapy within the first 2 hours (particularly
the first hour) can occasionally abort myocardial
infarction and dramatically reduce mortality.[69]
» Absolute contraindications: any prior
intracranial hemorrhage; known malignant
intracranial lesion or structural cerebral vascular
lesion (e.g., arteriovenous malformations);
ischemic stroke within previous 3 months;
suspected aortic dissection; active bleeding or
bleeding diathesis; and significant closed head
or facial trauma within previous 3 months.[69]
» Associated with an increased risk of bleeding

fibrinolytic therapy (i.e., treatment of residual
stenosis or suboptimal flow of the infarct
artery).[87] [106][142] Rescue PCI after
thrombolysis is recommended in patients with
evidence of failed reperfusion (such as ongoing
chest pain; hemodynamic, mechanical, or
electrical instability; or shock).
» Patients should be transferred for PCI as
soon as possible.[3] [144] Those transferred
within 6 hours after thrombolytic therapy had
significantly fewer ischemic complications than
those who were only transferred if they had
complications.[145]

» Prasugrel and ticagrelor are associated
with reduced ischemic events compared to
clopidogrel, though there is also an increased
bleeding risk with these agents.[113] [114] [115]
 Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a
history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic
attack, and its use is not recommended in
patients >75 years of age or in patients with low
body weight (<60 kg) due to increased bleeding
risk (though dose reductions may mitigate this
risk); therefore, ticagrelor is often more widely
used.[69] [106][116] [117] Ticagrelor may be
associated with higher risk of bleeding and
death than clopidogrel in olde patients.[118]
 Clopidogrel is an alternative P2Y12 inhibitor that
may be used when ticagrelor and prasugrel are
contraindicated or unavailable.[3] [118]

Emerging
Factor Xa inhibitors
These are being studied for acute coronary syndromes (ACS).[172]  Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor
that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events when given in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy to
stabilized STEMI patients, but increases bleeding events.[173] One review and meta-analysis found that
direct oral anticoagulants in combination with antiplatelet therapy were associated with a reduced risk of
ischemic events at the cost of an increase in major bleedings compared with antiplatelet therapy alone in
patients with STEMI.[174]
Factor IX inhibitors
Pegnivacogin, a factor IX inhibitor that is reversible with anivamersen, has been shown to reduce the
incidence of ischemic events in patients with ACS compared with intravenous heparin, when given during
coronary interventions.[175] [176] [177]
Factor XI inhibitors
Multiple factor XI inhibitors are under investigation for various indications.[178] Asundexian, a small molecule
factor XIa inhibitor, has been investigated specifically for ACS.[178]
Vorapaxar
Vorapaxar, an anti-protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) antiplatelet agent, showed a modest reduction in
post-myocardial infarction (MI) clinical events but with an increase in bleeding events.[179]
L-carnitine
One meta-analysis of 13 placebo-controlled trials found L-carnitine to significantly reduce all-cause mortality,
ventricular arrhythmias, and angina symptoms in patients experiencing acute MI. Further evaluation is
needed.[180]
Bone marrow stem-cell therapy
Stem-cell therapy has been proposed as a potential therapy for the repair and regeneration of damaged
vascular and cardiac tissue following an acute MI. Although current evidence suggests that stem-cell therapy
is safe, its effect on mortality, quality of life, and myocardial function following an acute MI is unclear.[181]
This is based, however, on limited evidence from small clinical trials. One randomized controlled study found
intracoronary bone marrow cell therapy to be safe, but its effect on myocardial function and myocardial
salvage was unclear.[182]
Colchicine
Several randomized control trials have investigated the role of the anti-inflammatory agent colchicine in both
chronic and ACS.[3] [183] Use of colchicine for secondary prevention was shown to significantly reduce
composite cardiovascular endpoints (including cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke) in meta-analyses of
trials investigating patients with a previous acute coronary event.[183] [184] [185] Research suggests the
beneficial effect is greater with early, in-hospital initiation of treatment.[186] Patients should be investigated
for liver and/or kidney disease prior to commencing colchicine.[187] The European Society of Cardiology
recommends that low-dose colchicine may be considered for long-term management of patients with ACS
on the basis of its anti-inflammatory properties, particularly if other risk factors are insufficiently controlled or
recurrent cardiovascular events occur under optimal therapy.[3]

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
MANAGEMENT
Dalcetrapib, a cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, has been shown to reduce the incidence of
new-onset diabetes in patients with recent ACS.[188]
Polypill therapy
One pill that combines routine post-ACS drugs (e.g., aspirin, an ACE inhibitor such as ramipril, and a statin
such as atorvastatin) has been shown to improve treatment compliance and consequently reduce risk of
adverse cardiovascular events post-ACS.[189]
Semaglutide
The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist semaglutide has been shown to reduce the risk of
death from cardiovascular causes in overweight patients with other cardiovascular risk factors.[190] [191]
Primary prevention
The most important preventive actions involve combined dietary and lifestyle modifications (stopping
smoking; increasing physical activity; losing weight; increasing consumption of fish, fruits, vegetables, fiber,
and nuts; reducing salt intake).[14] [62] The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends using the ‘'5A
model’' (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) as a framework for counseling patients in behavioral change
to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.[63]
Smoking is a leading preventable cause of disease, disability and death; even low levels of smoking increase
risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).[8] [14][17] Support programs, medications, and
alternative therapies are available. In adults who use tobacco, a combination of behavioral interventions plus
pharmacotherapy is recommended.[14] [17] Secondhand smoke exposure should be avoided.[14]
Although weight loss interventions improve cardiovascular risk factors (including weight, blood pressure,
lipids, insulin resistance) there is limited evidence of improved cardiovascular outcomes in weight loss
trials.[28] Given the imperfections of BMI as a risk marker, the limited efficacy of even multicomponent
lifestyle interventions in promoting sustained weight loss, and concern for weight stigma as a barrier to care,
providers might also focus on physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness rather than weight per se as a
treatment goal.
Routine and/or opportunistic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors with calculation of 10-year risk of
ASCVD should be used to guide decisions on treatment with preventive therapies (e.g., statins).[14] [64]
Among adults at borderline (5% to <7.5%) and intermediate (≥7.5% to <20%) risk, the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) states that it is reasonable to use the following additional
individual risk-enhancing clinical factors to guide decisions about preventive therapy.[14]
• Family history of premature ASCVD (men, ages <55 years; women, ages <65 years)
• Primary hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 160–189 mg/dL [4.1–4.8
mmol/L]; non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C], 190–219 mg/dL [4.9–5.6 mmol/L])
• Optimally, three determinations
• Metabolic syndrome (increased waist circumference [by ethnically appropriate cutpoints], elevated
triglycerides [>150 mg/dL, nonfasting], elevated blood pressure, elevated glucose, and low HDL-C [<40
mg/dL in men; <50 mg/dL in women] are factors; a tally of three makes the diagnosis)
• Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15–59 mL/min/1.73 m² with or
without albuminuria; not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation)
• Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or HIV/AIDS
• History of premature menopause (before age 40 years) and history of pregnancy-associated
conditions that increase later ASCVD risk, such as preeclampsia
• High-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., South Asian ancestry)
• Lipids/biomarkers: associated with increased ASCVD risk

• Persistently elevated (optimally, three determinations) primary hypertriglyceridemia (≥175 mg/
dL, nonfasting)
• If measured: elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (≥2.0 mg/L)
• If measured: elevated lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)): a relative indication for its measurement is family
history of premature ASCVD. An Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL or ≥125 nmol/L constitutes a risk-enhancing
factor, especially at higher levels of Lp(a).
• If measured: elevated apolipoprotein B (apoB) (≥130 mg/dL). A relative indication for its
measurement is triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL. A level ≥130 mg/dL corresponds to an LDL-C >160
mg/dL and constitutes a risk-enhancing factor.
• If measured: ankle-brachial index (ABI) (<0.9).
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends starting a statin for primary prevention in adults
ages 40-75 years without ASCVD but who have one or more cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia,
diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.[65] Those with
10-year risk between 7.5% and 10.0% may selectively be offered a statin.[65] For patients 76 years or older
there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against starting a statin for primary prevention.[65]
Aspirin is no longer routinely recommended for primary prevention but may be considered in selected
patients for whom the absolute cardiovascular benefit outweighs the absolute risk of increased bleeding.[66]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of CVD from the ACC/AHA.[14]
 Estimate CVD risk using a 10-year risk calculator, such as the Pooled Cohort Equations (ASCVD Risk
Estimator Plus). Newer calculators such as PREVENT™ may yield fewer treatment recommendations if
applied at thresholds as outlined in the table below; adjustments to risk thresholds may be required if using
PREVENT™ in conjunction with the ACC/AHA primary prevention guidance, although evidence to support
this approach is limited.
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.
Adults at borderline risk for ASCVD; without type 2 diabetes
5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk

Intervention Goal
Smoking cessation counseling ±

Advise all adults who use tobacco to quit; a
combination of behavioral interventions plus
pharmacotherapy is recommended to maximize quit
rates.
Advise all patients to avoid secondhand smoke
exposure to reduce ASCVD risk.

With overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle
interventions
Where feasible, refer patients for comprehensive
lifestyle interventions as part of a structured
program incorporating regular self-monitoring of
food intake, physical activity, and weight.
The ACC/AHA states that high intensity (≥14
sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight loss
interventions provided by a trained interventionist
work best. However, it is noted that other modalities,
such as electronically delivered weight loss
programs with personalized feedback and some
commercial-based programs, have also shown
moderate results.
Consider whether to offer select patients, or refer
them for, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved pharmacologic therapies and bariatric
surgery, adjunctive to complementary lifestyle
interventions.
It is recommended that BMI is interpreted with
caution in people of Asian ancestry, older adults,
and muscular adults.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss; reduced waist circumference;
increased physical activity; reduced caloric
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Weight loss:
• The ACC/AHA defines clinically meaningful
weight loss as ≥5% initial weight.
Waist circumference:
• Definitions of elevated waist circumference
are ≥40 inches (≥102 cm) in men and ≥35
inches (≥88 cm) in women.
Physical activity:
• Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic
physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥150
minutes/week (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on
most days of the week), is recommended for
initial weight loss.
• Higher levels of physical activity,
approximately 200-300 minutes/week, are
recommended to maintain weight loss or
minimize weight regain after 1 year.
Reduced caloric intake:
• Caloric intake should be reduced by ≥500
kcal/day from baseline, which often can be
attained by limiting women to 1200-1500 kcal/
day and men to 1500-1800 kcal/day.
• A very-low-calorie diet (defined as <800
kcal/day) is recommended only in limited
circumstances and only by trained clinicians
in a medical care setting with the patient
under medical supervision.

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
With moderate or severe hypercholesterolemia
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
A maximally-tolerated statin is recommended for
all patients ages 20-75 years with severe primary
hypercholesterolemia, regardless of estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk.
For patients ages >75 years, statins are not
routinely recommended, but may be considered on
a case-by-case basis depending on the individual
risk status and potential for adverse effects.
Although statins are not routinely recommended
in young adults ages 20-39 years, they
may be considered in those with moderate
hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1
mmol/L]) where there is a positive family history of
premature ASCVD.
See Hypercholesterolemia .

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
MANAGEMENT
With risk-enhancing factors or high coronary artery calcium score, but no
hypercholesterolemia; ages 40-75 years
Intervention Goal
Consider a moderate-intensity statin
If risk-enhancing factors are present, have a risk
discussion with the patient regarding initiation of a
moderate-intensity statin.
Coronary artery calcium scoring is not routinely
used to guide treatment decisions in the borderline
risk group. However in select borderline risk adults it
may be used to guide decision making regarding the
need for a statin as follows.
• Coronary artery calcium score 0 Agatston
units (AU): reasonable to withhold a statin
and reassess in 5-10 years, providing higher
risk conditions (e.g., diabetes, family history
of premature CHD, cigarette smoking) are
absent.
• Coronary artery calcium score 1-99 AU:
reasonable to initiate statin treatment for
patients ≥55 years.
• Coronary calcium score ≥100 AU or ≥75th
age/sex/race percentile: reasonable to initiate
a statin.
For patients >75 years old, statins are not routinely
recommended; assessment of risk status and a
clinician–patient risk discussion is needed to decide
whether to continue or initiate statin treatment,
taking into account statin safety and the potential for
statin-associated adverse effects.
Reduction in LDL-C by 30% to 49%; reduced
overall risk of ASCVD

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
Without severe primary cholesterolemia (LDL-C <190 mg/dL [<4.9 mmol/L]); ages 40-75 years
Intervention Goal
Consider a moderate-intensity statin,
following risk discussion
Have a risk discussion with the patient to decide
whether to initiate a moderate-intensity statin.
Knowledge of risk-enhancing factors is useful for
all patients but particularly for those at intermediate
risk (ASCVD risk of 7.5% to ≤20%). The presence
of risk-enhancing factors may lower the threshold for
statin initiation or intensification.
In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery
calcium scores may also be used to guide treatment
decisions as follows:
• Coronary artery calcium score 0 AU:
reasonable to withhold a statin and reassess
in 5-10 years, providing higher risk conditions
(e.g., diabetes, family history of premature
CHD, and cigarette smoking) are absent.
• Coronary artery calcium score 1-99 AU:
reasonable to initiate statin treatment for
patients ages ≥55 years.
• Coronary calcium score ≥100 AU or ≥75th
age/sex/race percentile:reasonable to initiate
a statin.

routinely recommended; assessment of risk status
and a clinician-patient risk discussion is needed

kidney disease, a target blood pressure
<130/80 mmHg is usually recommended.
With comprehensive evaluation suggestive of a favorable risk:benefit ratio for prophylactic
aspirin; ages 40-70 years
Intervention Goal
Consider low-dose aspirin
To balance the benefits and risks, low-dose aspirin
is recommended only for select adults ages 40-70
years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at
increased bleeding risk, following shared decision
making.
The ACC/AHH notes that prophylactic aspirin
generally becomes more favorable for patients with
>10% estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. This is an
individualized decision:
• Contemporary data show that absolute
risk for ASCVD events typically exceeds
that of bleeding and, although the gap of
relative benefit to relative harm for aspirin
has narrowed, the number needed to treat
to prevent an ASCVD event remains lower
than the number needed to harm to cause
bleeding.
• Some patients, in discussion with their
clinician, may feel that the benefit of
prophylactic aspirin is comparable to the
risk and may instead choose to focus on
optimal control of other modifiable ASCVD
risk factors.
Consider risk enhancing factors ± coronary artery
score, where available, as part of the risk:benefit
analysis.
Prophylactic aspirin is not typically recommended
for:
• Adults ages >70 years due to a potential risk
of harm, including increased risk of bleeding.
• Those ages <40 years; there is insufficient
evidence to judge the risk:benefit ratio of
routine aspirin for the primary prevention of
ASCVD in this age group.
Reduction of CVD risk
Reassess the appropriateness of treatment at
regular intervals, in case known risk factors for
increased bleeding develop, which may alter the
risk:benefit assessment.
Consider treatment discontinuation at age 70 years;
prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults
ages >70 years is potentially harmful and is not
recommended on a routine basis.
Adults at high risk for ASCVD; without type 2 diabetes

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
With overweight (BMI=25.0-29.9 kg/m²) or obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²)
Intervention Goal
Counseling and comprehensive lifestyle
interventions
Where feasible, refer patients for comprehensive
lifestyle interventions as part of a structured
program incorporating regular self-monitoring of
food intake, physical activity, and weight.
The ACC/AHA states that high intensity (≥14
sessions in 6 months) comprehensive weight loss
interventions provided by a trained interventionist
work best. However, it is noted that other modalities,
such as electronically delivered weight loss
programs with personalized feedback and some
commercial-based programs, have also shown
moderate results.
Consider whether to offer select patients, or refer
for pharmacologic therapies and bariatric surgery,
adjunctive to complementary lifestyle interventions.
It is recommended that BMI is interpreted with
caution in people of Asian ancestry, older adults,
and muscular adults.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss; reduced waist circumference;
increased physical activity; reduced caloric
intake; reduced overall risk of ASCVD
Weight loss:
• The ACC/AHA define clinically meaningful
weight loss as ≥5% initial weight.
Waist circumference:
• Definitions of elevated waist circumference
are ≥40 inches (≥102 cm) in men and ≥35
inches (≥88 cm) in women.
Physical activity:
• Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic
physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) for ≥150
minutes/week (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on
most days of the week), is recommended for
initial weight loss.
• Higher levels of physical activity,
approximately 200-300 minutes/week, are
recommended to maintain weight loss or
minimize weight regain after 1 year.
Reduced caloric intake:
• Caloric intake should be reduced by ≥500
kcal/day from baseline, which often can be
attained by limiting women to 1200-1500 kcal/
day and men to 1500-1800 kcal/day.
• A very-low-calorie diet (defined as <800
kcal/day) is recommended only in limited
circumstances and only by trained clinicians
in a medical care setting with the patient
under medical supervision.

With moderate or severe hypercholesterolemia
Intervention Goal
Individualized management
A maximally-tolerated statin is recommended for
all patients ages 20-75 years with severe primary
hypercholesterolemia, regardless of estimated 10-
year ASCVD risk.
For patients ages >75 years, statins are not
routinely recommended, but may be considered on
a case-by-case basis depending on the individual
risk status and potential for adverse effects.
Although statins are not routinely recommended
in young adults ages 20-39 years, they
may be considered in those with moderate
hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1
mmol/L]) where there is a positive family history of
premature ASCVD.
See Hypercholesterolemia .

risk of ASCVD
See Hypercholesterolemia .
Without severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C <190 mg/dL [<4.9 mmol/L]); ages 40-75
years
Intervention Goal
High-intensity statin
For these patients, it is reasonable to use a high-
intensity statin, following a risk discussion.
For patients ages >75 years, statins are not
routinely recommended; assessment of risk status
and a clinician-patient risk discussion is needed
to decide whether to continue or initiate statin
treatment, taking into account statin safety and the
potential for statin-associated adverse effects.
Reduction in LDL-C of 50% or more; reduced
overall risk of ASCVD

ST-elevation myocardial infarction Management
Secondary prevention
Systolic blood pressure should be maintained at <140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure at <80 mmHg,
LDL-cholesterol <70 mg/dL, and HbA1c <7% (or according to individualized target).[171] Smoking cessation
should be actively encouraged.[17] [153] [154] In overweight/obese patients weight loss is associated with an
improvement in the constituent elements of the metabolic syndrome, as well as a reduction in the pathologic
aspects implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD); endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.[28] Patients
should be advised to achieve/maintain a healthy weight.[3] Nonadherence to statin therapy and failure
to achieve lipid targets is associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality following acute MI.[220]
 Patients should be counseled on the importance of medication adherence.
Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of outcome following an acute MI.[3] Patients should be
encouraged to partake in regular aerobic and resistance exercise in addition to the exercise program of
cardiac rehabilitation; in patients with CAD, there is a direct correlation between the volume of moderate to
vigorous physical activity and reduction in cardiovascular risk and mortality.[35] [36]
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that, where
available, cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are provided for patients with STEMI,
particularly those with multiple modifiable risk factors and/or those moderate- to high-risk patients in whom
supervised exercise training is warranted.[152] [153] [154] [Evidence A] Systematic review evidence has
shown exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation helps to improve outcomes in people with coronary heart
disease.[155]
Patient discussions
Patients should refrain from any physical exertion until re-evaluated by a cardiologist in 2 to 3 weeks,
which may include stress testing. Further activity should be based on the extent of myocardial damage
with the acute myocardial infarction and the patient's condition. Patients should ideally increase their
activity gradually in a cardiac rehabilitation program, which has a proven role, under a monitored
setting.[219]

From the personal collection of Dr Mahi Ashwath; used with permission
Initiating risk-factor modification and aggressive medical management prior to discharge has been
associated with increased patient adherence. All patients should continue the optimal medical regimen
indefinitely. This includes aspirin, P2Y₁₂ inhibitor (up to 1 year), beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors
(especially in patients with decreased ejection fraction).
Ejection fraction is assessed by echocardiography 3 months after the acute episode and then periodically
thereafter, depending on left ventricular (LV) function and symptoms.[79] Patients with ejection fraction
<35% at 3 months' follow-up should be referred to an electrophysiologist for consideration of an
implantable cardioverter defibrillator, as there is a high risk for arrhythmias in this population. Patients
who develop diminished LV function and congestive heart failure should be followed up and managed
appropriately.
Patients with a history of myocardial infarction are at increased risk for recurrent infarction. They should
be evaluated by stress testing or cardiac catheterization if symptoms develop. Routine periodic ischemic
evaluations with stress echocardiography or myocardial perfusion studies are controversial.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
sinus bradycardia, first-degree heart block, and type I
second-degree heart block
short term medium
Usually develop with occlusion of the right coronary artery, and are caused by infarction of the
atrioventricular node and the conduction system above the His bundle or by increased vagal tone.
These arrhythmias are usually benign and transient and do not require any treatment. If the heart rate
goes below 50 bpm and the patient is symptomatic, give intravenous atropine.
Temporary pacing may be required if heart failure, syncope, or angina develop.
complete heart block with anterior#MI short term medium
Can develop acutely in patients with anterior infarcts and may lead to ventricular asystole.
Complete heart block in anterior infarcts occurs because of infarction and necrosis of the bundle branches
in the septum.
Transcutaneous or, preferably, transvenous pacing should be carried out in these patients immediately
after conduction defects are noticed. Permanent pacing is usually required.
recurrent chest pain short term medium
Chest pain may occur after percutaneous coronary intervention.[214]
Angina-like symptoms should be assessed with ECG changes for escalation of medical therapy, and
repeat angiography considered.[69]
type II second-degree heart block with anterior#MI short term low
Usually occurs from a defect in the conduction system below the His bundle and can rapidly progress into
complete heart block in patients with anterior MI.
Transcutaneous or, preferably, transvenous cardiac pacing should be carried out in these patients
immediately after conduction defects are noted.
complete heart block with inferior#MI short term low
Can develop in patients with inferior infarcts caused by vagal stimulation.
Usually transient or resolved with atropine.
Temporary pacing may be required if heart failure, syncope, or angina develop. Permanent pacing is rarely
required.

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
acute mitral regurgitation short term low
Acute mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle rupture is a rare but serious complication of AMI, with in-
hospital mortality rates of 10% to 40%.[215] Inferior MI can cause rupture of the posteromedial papillary
muscle, while anterolateral infarctions can cause rupture of the anterolateral papillary muscle.[215]
Right ventricular papillary muscle rupture is rare and can cause life-threatening tricuspid regurgitation.
Complete papillary muscle rupture causes wide-open mitral regurgitation and is usually fatal.
Risk factors for papillary muscle rupture include older age, female sex, history of heart failure, chronic
kidney disease, and delayed presentation with a first acute-MI.[215]
Patients typically present 3-5 days after a transmural infarct, with acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic
shock.[90] [215] Diagnosis is made on echocardiogram, which shows severe mitral regurgitation, often
with an eccentric jet and a mobile mass, sometimes prolapsing into the left atrium.[215] Inotropic support,
mechanical ventilation, and an intra-aortic balloon pump should be considered for transient stabilization
before emergency surgery.[215] Inotropic support and an intra-aortic balloon pump should be considered
for transient stabilization before emergency surgery.[215]
ventricular septal defects (VSD) short term low
Interventricular septal rupture causing a VSD can occur, though is rare, occuring in about 0.3% of acute
MI.[215] Risk factors include older age, female sex, and delayed reperfusion following acute MI.[215]
 Patients typically present 3-5 days after an acute MI with symptoms such as dyspnea and orthopnea,
hypotension, peripheral vasoconstriction and oliguria.[215] Exam reveals a new pansystolic murmur
with signs of pulmonary venous congestion.[215] Diagnosis is made on echocardiogram and cardiac
catheterization.[215]
Treatment depends on the severity at presentation, though is primarily emergency cardiac surgery.[215]
 Stabilization with ECMO or Impella devices may be indicated.[215]
Mortality of an uncorrected VSD is around 80% at 30 days.[215]
Survival depends on early recognition, defect size, and degree of impairment of ventricular function.
Ventricular free wall rupture short term low
The exact incidence of ventricular free wall rupture causing acute pericardial tamponade is unknown
because it most often presents with out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death.[215]
Free wall rupture should be suspected in any patient that presents with cardiovascular collapse or
hemodynamic instability after acute MI, particularly following delayed presentation/revascularization.[215]
 Patients present with clinical signs of cardiac tamponade; muffled heart sounds, elevated jugular venous
pressure, pulsus paradoxus, and/or frank electromechanical dissociation.[215]
There is an increased risk of ventricular wall rupture involving anterior and lateral walls after anterior MI.
Incomplete rupture can result in the development of a pseudoaneurysm.
Free wall rupture is rapidly fatal; however, diagnosis can be confirmed on echocardiogram, and should
precipitate immediate surgical correction of the necrotic myocardium and primary reconstruction.
Inotropic support and intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation or ECMO for transient stabilization should be
considered before surgery. Even with surgical correction, the in-hospital mortality is ~35%.[215]

Complications Timeframe Likelihood
post infarction pericarditis (Dressler syndrome) short term low
Occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with MI.
Aspirin is the treatment of choice, as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs impair scar formation in
animal studies.[216]
congestive heart failure (CHF) long term high
CHF caused by decreased left ventricular (LV) function occurs frequently after MI, because of myocardial
damage, infarct progression, and LV remodeling after the acute episode. Heart failure post MI may be
more common in females than males.[213]
Appropriate use of medications, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor
antagonists, and diuretics, when appropriate, decreases the incidence and progression of CHF.
Biventricular pacing should be considered if appropriate criteria are met.
ventricular arrhythmias variable high
Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can occur during ischemia and reperfusion and can
be lethal. They can also occur at any stage following a myocardial infarction (MI) because of re-entry
circuits at the border of myocardial scar and normal myocardium and are commonly seen in patients with
decreased ejection fraction.
Electrolytes should be optimized, especially potassium and magnesium, as electrolyte imbalance
increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Potassium should be maintained at >4 mEq/L and
magnesium at >2 mEq/L.
Appropriate therapy should be initiated with direct current cardioversion and antiarrhythmic therapy.
Optimal medical management, in particular beta-blockers, decreases incidence of ventricular arrhythmias.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator should be considered for all patients with persistently decreased left
ventricular ejection fraction (<35%) if there has been no response to 3 months of intensive medical therapy
after MI.[208]
recurrent ischemia and infarction variable high
Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can have recurrent ischemia or infarction caused by further
plaque rupture and progression of atherosclerosis.
Recurrence should be treated in the same manner as the initial presentation.
Aggressive risk factor modification after the initial presentation decreases incidence of recurrences.
depression variable high
Depression is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for adverse outcomes following acute
coronary syndrome (ACS).[55] ACS can also precipitate depression in people without prior psychiatric
conditions.[55] [209] [210] Patients should routinely be screened for depression following an MI.[209]
[211] Data suggest that a combined psychosocial approach to the treatment of depression improves
outcome in patients. Exercise combined with pharmacotherapy may be the most efficacious approach.[54]

 Pharmacotherapy may be associated with excess risk in patients with residual cardiac dysfunction;
cognitive behavioral therapy or exercise therapy may be more appropriate in this patient group.[212]
in-stent thrombosis variable low
Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 12 months in all patients whether they have been
stented or not. In-stent thrombosis is often precipitated by premature cessation of dual antiplatelet
therapy, but can also be caused by technical factors and other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus.
Patients and their family should be strongly cautioned in hospital and in follow-up appointments about the
importance of dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months.[217]
left ventricular (LV) thrombus variable low
LV thrombus can be seen in the early days of AMI, especially large anterior MI with dyskinesia of the
apex.[218] The reported incidence of LV thrombus after anterior STEMI varies widely in the literature,
ranging from 4% to 39%.[218] Echocardiography studies conducted before revascularization became
routine practice suggested LV thrombus was present in about one third of patients with large anterior MI;
more recent estimates are lower, likely relating to improved reperfusion interventions.[218] Formation of
LV thrombus after acute MI is associated with a 5.5-fold increased risk of embolic events compared with
no thrombus. Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant is recommended for
patients with LV thrombus.[218]
left ventricular (LV) aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm variable low
The incidence of LV aneurysm formation after AMI is low (<5%) in the era of reperfusion therapy, and it is
seen more frequently in large anterior MI, with total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.[215]
The presence of LV aneurysm may increase the risk for angina pectoris, thromboembolic complications,
and arrhythmia, although surgery is rarely needed to correct the aneurysm.[69] [215]
In comparison to true aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms more often occur in the inferior or lateral wall.[215]
 LV pseudoaneurysms present in a very diverse way, weeks to years after an acute MI.[215] Patients may
be asymptomatic, though the majority present with shortness of breath, chest pain, or signs and symptoms
of congestive cardiac failure.[215] LV pseudoaneurysm requires urgent surgical repair because of the risk
of progression to LV rupture.[215]
Prognosis
Prognosis for patients with STEMI varies depending on time to presentation after onset of chest pain and
time to treatment after presentation. In-hospital mortality from STEMI is around 9%.[200] [201] Prognosis
is improved by early reperfusion, adherence to appropriate medical therapy, and risk factor modification.
Patients with elevated troponin levels have a worse prognosis than those with normal troponin levels.[72][73]
Participation in cardiac rehabilitation reduces all-cause mortality and readmissions for cardiac reasons.[202]
Nonfatal health outcomes (including development of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease,
peripheral arterial disease, severe bleeding, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, dementia, depression, and
cancer) and all-cause mortality are higher in patients that have had an myocardial infarction, than in
patients that have not.[203] Adherence to evidence-based medicine has been shown to have better
patient outcomes.[204] [205] Major bleeding as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
(BARC) or the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) bleeding score is associated with worse 1-year
mortality.[206] Specific risk models to predict mortality following acute coronary syndrome in older adults
have been developed, including variables such as hearing impairment, mobility impairment, weight loss, and
patient-reported health status.[207]

Note
ᵃ  The Cochrane Clinical Answer (CCA) and the Cochrane review it is based upon note that the population
consisted mainly of middle-aged men post-MI or revascularization, which may limit the generalizability of
results particularly to women and higher risk men (e.g., those with angina pectoris or major comorbidities).
ᵇ  This outcome was also reported as not statistically significantly different at >12-36 months and >3 years.
However, GRADE was not reported for these timepoints.
ᶜ  The CCA notes that exercise may modestly reduce total mortality at all time points (6-12 months, >12-36
months, and at >3 years) compared with usual care but none of the analyses reached statistical significance.
ᵈ  The CCA also notes that six RCTs with 1731 participants reported better physical component scores with
exercise compared with usual care, although results did not reach statistical significance.
* Evidence levels
The Evidence level is an internal rating applied by BMJ Best Practice. See the EBM Toolkit (https://
bestpractice.bmj.com/info/evidence-tables/) for details.
Confidence in evidence
A -  High or moderate to high
B -  Moderate or low to moderate
C -  Very low or low

† Effectiveness (BMJ rating)
Based on statistical significance, which demonstrates that the results are unlikely to be due to chance, but
which does not necessarily translate to a clinical significance.
‡ Grade certainty ratings
High The authors are very confident that the true
effect is similar to the estimated effect.
Moderate The authors are moderately confident that
the true effect is likely to be close to the
estimated effect.
Low The authors have limited confidence in the
effect estimate and the true effect may be
substantially different.
Very Low The authors have very little confidence in
the effect estimate and the true effect is
likely to be substantially different.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
