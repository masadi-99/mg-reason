New-onset atrial fibrillation Overview
Summary
New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is a new or first detectable episode of a chaotic and irregular atrial
arrhythmia. Prevalence increases progressively with age.
AF causes significant morbidity and mortality including palpitations, dyspnea, angina, dizziness or syncope,
and features of congestive heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, stroke, and death.
ECG shows absent P waves, presence of fibrillatory waves, and irregularly irregular QRS complexes.
Most patients presenting with new-onset or “acute” atrial fibrillation (AF) do not require immediate
cardioversion. Most patients will require medical therapy to control ventricular rate initially, and rhythm control
subsequently.
Patients who develop hemodynamic compromise should have immediate direct current cardioversion.
If the precise timing of the onset of AF is unclear, a transesophageal echocardiogram must be performed to
exclude left atrial clots before cardioversion.
Definition
AF is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation and consequently ineffective
atrial contraction.[1]
Electrocardiographic characteristics include: irregularly irregular R-R intervals (where atrioventricular
conduction is not impaired); absence of distinct repeating P waves; irregular atrial activations also known as
fibrillatory waves.[1]
New-onset AF is defined as a new onset or a first detectable episode of AF, whether symptomatic or not.
This topic will concentrate on new-onset AF in the nonvalvular and nonsurgical settings. For more information
on paroxysmal and asymptomatic new-onset AF see Established atrial fibrillation .

New-onset atrial fibrillation Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia worldwide.[1] The Global Burden of Disease 2017
study found the prevalence of AF to be 481.5 per 100,000 person-years, affecting 19.8 million men and 17.8
million women worldwide.[4] The estimated global prevalence was 50 million in 2020.[1] However, the true
prevalence is difficult to ascertain. Both incidence and prevalence rates are higher in older people, and in
developed countries, with the highest prevalence in high-income North America.[4] [5] 
While the age-adjusted incidence and prevalence of AF are lower in women than in men, mortality risk due
to AF is similar or higher in women compared with men.[2] Women with AF may be more symptomatic, older,
and/or have more comorbidities than men.[5]
Epidemiologic data on new-onset AF are limited. Extrapolation from the Framingham study indicates
the incidence of new-onset AF in middle-aged (age 55 years) women and men to be 0.2% and 0.3%,
respectively.[6] In patients with a first-ever ischemic stroke, there is a high prevalence (15% to 25%) of AF,
and the incidence of AF is around 5%.[7] [8] Studies assessing prolonged ECG monitoring (using a 30-day
event-triggered recorder, or an insertable cardiac monitoring device) in patients with cryptogenic stroke have
found AF to be common in these patients.[9] [10] [11] New-onset AF occurs in approximately 10% of patients
after acute myocardial infarction and in 20% of patients with heart failure, and independently predicts a worse
short- and long-term prognosis among patients with these conditions.[12] [13] [14] [15] [16]
Etiology
Coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, valvular disease, diabetes, sepsis, chronic kidney
disease, thyroid disorders, cardiac surgery, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, sedentary lifestyle, and
advanced age are known risk factors for the development of new-onset AF.[1] [11] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]
 However, AF may occur in the absence of any underlying cardiac or noncardiac diseases: for example, as a
result of heavy alcohol intake.[17] [23] [24] [25]
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology of AF involves multiple etiologies and complex electrophysiologic changes for which
AF is the final common pathway.[1] [17] [26] [27] [28] The presence of rapidly firing foci, typically in the
pulmonary veins, may trigger AF that is then sustained by the faltered electrophysiology of fibrosed and
often dilated atria. Fibrosis and inflammation of atria causes a difference in the conduction properties and
refractory periods within the atrial tissue and promotes electrical reentry that results in AF. The fractionation
of a mother wave into multiple wavelets in the presence of enlarged atria in conjunction with the short
refractory periods and slow conduction properties of the atria lead to sustained AF.[27] [29] [30]

New-onset atrial fibrillation Theory
Multiple wavelets of atrial fibrillation compete with each other in the
atrium and bombard the atrioventricular node with many signals.
From: Cox D, Dougall H. Student BMJ. 2001;09:399-442
AF may also result as degeneration of other rapid arrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or
atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia and AV reentrant tachycardia. The latter occurs in the
presence of congenital accessory bypass tract/s, either concealed or manifest (Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome).[17] [26] [28]
Although higher ventricular rate from AF may cause an increase in the coronary flow, it may not be adequate
to compensate for the increased myocardial oxygen demand that occurs as a result of irregularity in the
ventricular rhythm.[31] Cardiac ischemia may thus develop even in patients without CAD, and this contributes
to left ventricular dysfunction and subsequent symptoms of chest discomfort, dizziness, and shortness of
breath.[31]
AF is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.[29] AF causes activation of the coagulation
cascade, structural changes (both as cause and effect of AF) promote clot formation, and the loss of atrial
systole leads to relative stagnation of blood.[32]
Classification
Classification and definition of AF subtypes
The practice guidelines for the management of patients with AF developed by the American College of
Cardiology, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm
Society classify and define AF into the following types:[1] [2] [3]
• Paroxysmal AF: AF that is recurrent (>1 episode ≥30 seconds in duration) and that terminates
spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days.

New-onset atrial fibrillation Theory
THEORY
• Persistent AF: AF that is continuously sustained beyond 7 days, including episodes terminated by
cardioversion after 7 days or longer.
• Long-standing persistent AF: a subgroup of persistent AF, that is continuous for >1 year.
• Permanent AF: AF that is refractory to cardioversion and sinus rhythm cannot be restored or
maintained, such that AF is accepted as a final rhythm. A decision has been made by the patient
and physician not to pursue restoration of sinus rhythm by any means, including catheter or surgical
ablation.
• Subclinical AF: the term subclinical AF usually represents asymptomatic episodes of AF detected
either by cardiac implantable electronic devices or by cardiac monitors.
The following terms are no longer recommended:[1]
• Nonvalvular AF: AF in the absence of rheumatic mitral stenosis, a mechanical or bioprosthetic heart
valve, or mitral valve repair. The terms valvular/nonvalvular differentiate patients with AF in the
presence/absence of moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a prosthetic heart valve. The European
Society of Cardiology advises that this terminology may be confusing and should be avoided.[2]
• Lone AF: the term "lone AF" applies to patients ages <60 years without echocardiographic or clinical
evidence of cardiac, pulmonary, or circulatory disease. However, because definitions are variable,
and all patients with AF have some form of pathophysiologic basis, the term “lone AF” is potentially
confusing and should not be used.
• Chronic AF: has variable definitions. For more information on chronic AF see Established atrial
fibrillation .
Case history
Case history #1
A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia presents to the
emergency department with the first episode of rapid palpitations, shortness of breath, and discomfort
in his chest. These symptoms started acutely and have been present for 4 hours. Physical exam shows
an irregularly irregular radial pulse at a rate between 90 and 110 bpm, BP 110/70 mmHg, and respiratory
rate of 20 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are irregular, but no third or fourth heart sound gallop or
murmurs are audible. There are no other abnormalities on examination.
Case history #2
A 56-year-old woman with a 6-week history of weight loss, anxiety, and insomnia presents with
palpitations and dyspnea. Her pulse rate is irregular at 140-150 bpm. Her BP is 95/55 mmHg. She looks
thin, frail, and rather anxious and jittery. Her palms are sweaty and have fine tremors. She has a palpable
smooth goiter. Examination of the eyes shows bilateral exophthalmoses.

New-onset atrial fibrillation Diagnosis
Approach
New-onset AF can present with rapid palpitations, fluttering in the chest, dizziness, or shortness of breath.
Some patients may also present with stroke and embolic events. The onset of the first episode, its duration,
and precipitating factors should be established. The presence of symptoms at the first presentation does not
affect the longer-term prognosis, but does increase the likelihood of detecting AF, and making the correct
diagnosis.[74]
History and examination
The majority of patients present with symptoms related to the arrhythmia, most of which occur as a result
of a rapid ventricular rate. Typical symptoms include palpitations, a sense of the heart racing, dizziness
and shortness of breath. Some patients may present with focal neurologic deficits such as hemiplegia or
dysphasia due to a stroke.
The pulse should be assessed. An irregularly irregular pulse, both in the rhythm and volume, is
characteristic. Signs of the underlying cause of AF, such as elevated neck veins (jugular venous pressure)
and pulmonary crepitations in heart failure or tremor, sweating, and goiter in hyperthyroidism, should be
looked for.
ECG
An ECG should be the first test requested. Absent P waves that have been replaced by irregular
fibrillatory waves, and irregularly irregular QRS complexes will confirm the diagnosis of AF.

In contrast, P waves that have been replaced by a saw-tooth appearance in the inferior limb leads, and
QRS complexes that are regularly (typically 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 P to QRS ratio) irregular are characteristic of
atrial flutter. Abnormal and variable morphology P waves can occur in atrial tachycardia.

complexes. In patients with pacemakers, ECG may exhibit regular ventricular paced complexes. In these
patients, the atrial rhythm will still show irregular fibrillatory waves from AF.
Mobile health technologies, including smart devices, are a popular research area for AF detection.[75]
[76] There are currently >100,000 mobile health apps and ≥400 wearable activity monitors available, and
while many have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific at detecting AF, most are not clinically
validated and caution is advised for clinical use.[2] [77] [78] The WATCH AF and Apple Heart studies
compared smartwatch-based technologies and algorithms with diagnosis of AF by cardiologists; the
results suggest that use of commercially-available devices may have some accuracy in detecting AF and
are potentially feasible as complementary tools for screening.[11] [79] [80] If AF is detected by mobile or
wearable devices, the diagnosis should always be confirmed with single-lead or 12-lead ECG analyzed by
a physician with expertise in ECG rhythm interpretation.[2] [79] [80]
Investigation for causal factors
Blood biochemistry should be checked for electrolyte abnormalities. Cardiac biomarkers should be
checked if chest pain is a feature. Thyroid function testing should be part of the initial assessment,
particularly in older people, as classic signs of thyrotoxicosis may not be obvious.[52] [81]
High-sensitivity (hs) troponins may be elevated in patients presenting with AF. The hs troponin level is
independently associated with a raised risk of stroke, cardiac death, and major bleeding and improves risk
stratification beyond the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.[82] [83]
Liver function tests (LFTs) are useful to determine presence of a multisystem disorder affecting the liver.
Furthermore, LFTs are useful to choose appropriate antiarrhythmic agents and to monitor antiarrhythmic
drug therapy. For example, amiodarone is contraindicated in the presence of liver dysfunction; and
amiodarone treatment should be discontinued when LFTs show abnormalities.
A chest x-ray (CXR) should be performed to look for evidence of structural heart disease, such as
enlargement of the cardiac chambers or valvular calcification, and signs of heart failure. The CXR may
also suggest a precipitating cause of AF, such as pneumonia.
Following the initial assessment, patients should undergo echocardiography to evaluate cardiac chamber
size and left ventricular function. This may also reveal an underlying cause such as valvular disease.[84]
A transesophageal echocardiogram is essential in patients before cardioversion (unless they are already
anticoagulated) to rule out left atrial clots.

Electrophysiologic studies may be required to identify arrhythmias such as Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome, atrial flutter, or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
Exercise echocardiography and the exercise nuclear imaging stress test are both useful to identify
structural abnormalities of the heart and assess for coronary artery disease. A stress test is useful to
assess adequate rate control when a rate control strategy is used. The exercise stress test also helps
to determine whether there is a “use dependence” pro-arrhythmic effect (i.e., when channel-blocking
agents have greater effect at faster heart rates, and thus may be proarrhythmic at faster rate) of class
Ic antiarrhythmic agents such as flecainide and propafenone.[85] However, do not use these tests or
coronary CT angiography routinely in the initial diagnosis of AF if there are no symptoms or signs of
cardiovascular disease.[86]
A treadmill exercise stress test may be useful for risk stratification for risk of sudden cardiac death in
patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The sudden loss of pre-excitation delta waves at a faster
heart rate during exercise stress testing indicates that the antegrade conduction property of the accessory
bypass tract is weaker, and the risk of sudden cardiac death from AF is therefore lower.

New-onset atrial fibrillation Diagnosis
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
irregular pulse rate (common)
• Although a hallmark of AF, irregularity of the pulse rate may not be appreciated if the rate is very rapid.
In patients with high-grade conduction block, or with regular paced complexes in patients with cardiac
pacemaker devices, the pulse rate may be regular even in the presence of AF.
Other diagnostic factors
palpitations (common)
• Palpitations are often described as a fluttering in the chest or a feeling of the heart "racing" or
"galloping".
hypotension (common)
• AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause hemodynamic instability.
elevated jugular venous pressure (common)
• New-onset AF may be associated with heart failure.
added heart sounds (common)
• Underlying valvular disease, such as mitral stenosis due to rheumatic heart disease, may be audible.
• A gallop rhythm may be heard in heart failure. The fourth heart sound is typically not heard because of
an absence of atrial kick.
• Pericardial rub may be heard in cases of pericarditis.
dizziness (uncommon)
• Occurs as a result of rapid heart rate and hypotension.
dyspnea (uncommon)
• A history of shortness of breath and orthopnea suggests underlying heart failure, while new-onset AF
with a rapid ventricular rate can also present with shortness of breath.
rales (uncommon)
• May be present in patients with heart failure.
evidence of stroke (uncommon)
• Signs of an acute stroke, such as hemiplegia or dysphasia, may be the first presentation of AF.
• Ischemic stroke was associated with an increased risk of incident AF in a longitudinal study, especially
in people with higher CHADS2 or CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores.[87]

increasing age
• Age is significantly associated with risk of AF in both sexes (odds ratio 2.1 for men and 2.2 for women
for each decade of advancing age).[19] [20] The prevalence of AF is 0.5% in people ages 50-59 years,
and 8.8% in people ages 80-89 years.[20]
hypertension
• Hypertension is one of the risk factors most strongly associated with AF globally, regardless of gender.
Hypertension is significantly associated with risk of AF in both sexes (odds ratio 1.5 for men and 1.4
for women).[20] [21]
orthostatic hypotension
• Orthostatic hypotension is common in older age and is associated with high risk of developing new-
onset AF (odds ratio up to 1.5).[33] This association is independent of the presence of hypertension
and other cardiovascular risk factors.[33]
diabetes mellitus
• Both prediabetes and established diabetes are associated with a significantly increased risk of AF
(20% and 28%, respectively), even with adequate glycemic control.[20] [34] [35]
heart failure
• Significantly associated with risk of AF in both sexes (odds ratio 4.5 for men and 5.9 for women).[20]
AF is present in about 35% of patients presenting with acute heart failure; patients with heart failure
and AF are at greater risk of all-cause mortality.[15] New-onset AF in heart failure, or vice versa, is
associated with a significantly worse prognosis than with chronic concomitant AF and heart failure.[15]
[36] AF is associated with heart failure of all stages and types including heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF). In patients with unexplained dyspnea and normal EF, the probability of
underlying HFpEF can be estimated by the H2FPEF score system (Heavy 2, Hypertension 1, AF 3,
Pulmonary hypertension 1, Elder 1, and Filling pressure 1), which gives maximum score of 3 points for
the presence and any history of AF.[37] AF is highly prevalent in HFpEF and is associated with more
advanced disease, poorer exercise capacity, and increased mortality.[38]
valvular and structural heart disease
• Significantly associated with risk of AF in both sexes (odds ratio 1.8 for men and 3.4 for women):
in particular, mitral valve disease, and rheumatic heart disease in developing countries.[20]
[21] Cardiomyopathy is also strongly associated with AF; as many as 20% of patients with a
cardiomyopathy of any cause (except peripartum cardiomyopathy) have AF.[21] [39]
coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes
• Coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are significantly associated with
risk of AF (odds ratio 1.4 for men and 1.2 for women).[20] Associated risk factors for the development
of AF in patients presenting with ACS include older age and higher heart rate at presentation.[16]
New-onset AF in patients with ACS is strongly associated with ischemic stroke.[40]
other atrial arrhythmias
• May be associated with atrial flutter, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, or atrioventricular nodal
reentrant tachycardias.[2] Premature atrial complexes (PACs) are associated with up to three times
increased risk of AF.[41]

sepsis and critical illness
• AF is a common finding in patients with sepsis, particularly in patients hospitalized in intensive care
units, with an incidence of up to 46% in patients with septic shock.[42] [43] In this patient group, AF is
associated with increased length of intensive care stay, a >2-fold increased risk of in-hospital ischemic
stroke, as well as increased mortality.[19] [42] [43][44] [45] A further increase in risk of new-onset AF
is seen in patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor treatment, with fungal infection, who undergo
right heart catheterization, and who are treated with corticosteroids.[45] Inflammatory processes are
a common denominator of many conditions and comorbidities associated with AF, but may also play a
direct role in the genesis of AF, as suggested by the finding of increased C-reactive protein before the
onset of AF.[3] [19]
cardiac or thoracic surgery
• AF is a common postoperative complication.[2] [43][46] Coexisting risk factors such as obesity and
vitamin D deficiency may further increase the risk of AF following cardiac surgery.[47] [48]
obesity
• Obesity is strongly associated with the development and recurrence of AF; weight gain is a risk factor
for AF, with estimates suggesting that with every 5-unit increase in body mass index, the risk of AF
increases by about 29%.[47] [49] [50] [51] Obese people may have increased left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, sympathetic activity and inflammation, and atrial fatty infiltration, which can cause voltage
abnormalities and conduction block and an increased risk of AF.[2] [47] Epicardial fatty infiltration has
been hypothesized as a pro-arrhythmic substrate; this may account for the significant risk of AF in
obesity.[47]
hyperthyroidism
• About 10% to 15% of patients with untreated thyrotoxicosis develop AF.[52]
Weak
hypoxic pulmonary conditions
• Includes COPD and obstructive sleep apnea.[2] [22] Of patients with AF, 13% have coexisting chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); outcomes are often worse in these patients, with twice the
risk of death from all causes, and increased risk of cardiovascular death and major bleeding than in
patients without respiratory disease.[53] One systematic review of intensive care unit patients with
new-onset AF recognized acute respiratory failure as a significant risk factor for AF.[19]
alcohol consumption
• AF is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general, but even modest alcohol intake, of 1-2 drinks
per day, is strongly associated with increased risk of AF in comparison with other cardiovascular
diseases.[24] [25] Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in
patients with newly diagnosed AF.[54] Heavy alcohol intake increases the risk of AF further, with a
hazard ratio of 1.45 in men who consume ≥35 alcoholic drinks per week.[23]
smoking
• May be associated with AF. One meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found that the risk was
higher in male smokers compared with female smokers.[55] The risk is highest in current smokers,
who have a 32% increased risk of AF compared with lifelong nonsmokers.[56]

inflammatory disorders
• Inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis have been associated with an
increased risk of AF.[57] [58]
excessive exercise
• Extreme levels of exercise may be associated with a higher risk of AF, or merely no further benefit.[59]
[60] [61]
• Moderate exercise, at a volume of 5-20 metabolic equivalents (METs) per week, and a high level of
cardiorespiratory fitness appears to be beneficial and is associated with a decreased risk of AF.[59]
[61] [62] [63]
height
• Taller individuals are likely to be at increased risk of AF. Likely mechanisms are related to the larger
left atrial size that is associated with tall stature.[64] In the Copenhagen City Heart Study, height was
found to be a risk factor for incident AF, with 35% to 65% higher risk of AF per 10 cm difference in
height.[65]
cancer and chemotherapy
• AF has been shown to be associated with various forms of cancer including breast, colorectal, lung,
kidney, and ovarian, and may even precede a diagnosis of cancer.[66] One population-based case-
control study from Denmark consisting of 28,833 patients with AF and 283,260 sex-, age-, and county-
matched population controls showed that patients with AF were more likely to be diagnosed with
colorectal cancer within 90 days before their AF diagnosis (OR 11.8, 95% CI 9.3 to 14.9).[67]
• Of the various arrhythmias induced by the various forms of cancer therapy, AF is one of the most
common that is encountered, especially with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.[68] [69]

Patients with concomitant severe atrioventricular conduction
block (inherent or drug-induced [e.g., digoxin toxicity]) may have
bradycardia and regular ventricular escape rhythm resulting in regular
QRS complexes. In patients with pacemakers, ECG may exhibit
regular ventricular paced complexes. In these patients the atrial
rhythm will still show irregular fibrillatory waves from AF.

• Exercise echocardiography and the exercise nuclear imaging stress
test are both useful to determine structural abnormalities of the
heart and assess for coronary artery disease (CAD), for assessing
adequate rate control, and to determine whether there is a “use
dependence” proarrhythmic effect (i.e., when channel-blocking
agents have greater effect at faster heart rates, and thus can have
proarrhythmia at faster rate) of class Ic antiarrhythmic agents.[85]
 However, do not use these tests routinely in the initial diagnosis of
AF. If there are no symptoms or signs of cardiovascular disease then
cardiac imaging beyond a transthoracic echocardiogram is rarely
needed.[86]
• A treadmill exercise stress test may also be useful for risk
stratification for risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with Wolff-
Parkinson-White syndrome. The sudden loss of preexcitation delta
waves at faster heart rate during exercise stress test indicates that
the antegrade conduction property of the accessory bypass tract is
weaker, and the risk of sudden cardiac death from AF is therefore
lower.

Criteria
American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines emphasize a
risk factor-based approach using a validated clinical risk score such as the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score system.
The CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is considered the most validated score; however, newer online calculators
for risk scores, such as ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation) and GARFIELD
(Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation), in comparison to CHA₂DS₂-VASc, may
modestly improve discrimination between high versus low risk and may offer potential advantages in specific
populations.[1]
CHA₂DS₂-VASc scoring system for risk of thromboembolism[1] [2]
2 points each:
• History of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism
• Age ≥75 years
1 point each:
• Age 65-74 years
• History of hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, or vascular disease (myocardial infarction,
complex aortic plaque, peripheral arterial disease)

According to this scoring system, a score of 0-5, 6, and 7-15 indicates low, intermediate, and high risk,

GARFIELD[89]
The GARFIELD risk calculator assesses future risk of mortality, ischemic stroke and major bleeding to guide
use of anticoagulants in patients with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
It includes the variables age, history of stroke, bleeding, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, region,
ethnicity, anticoagulant use, female sex, history of carotid occlusive disease, dementia, and smoking.
According to this scoring system, a score of 0-0.89, 0.9-1.59, and ≥1.6 indicates low, intermediate, and high
risk, respectively.
CHADS₂ scoring system for risk of thromboembolism[90]
In patients with AF and nonvalvular (particularly rheumatic) heart disease, the risk of thromboembolic stroke
was historically estimated by calculating the CHADS₂ score. The CHADS₂ score system is useful and easy
to remember. However, because the risk of thromboembolic events is a continuum, categorization of the
risks into low, moderate, and high is artificial, especially taking only a few risk factors into account. The
value of the CHADS₂ score system in the risk stratification of patients with AF who undergo direct current
cardioversion is not reliable, especially for those patients with a low CHADS₂ score, and it has been replaced
by CHA₂DS₂-VASc in guidelines.[91]
The variables are congestive heart failure (C), hypertension (H), age (A), diabetes mellitus (D), and a history
of stroke (S). Each variable is given 1 point except the presence of a history of stroke or prior transient
ischemic attack, which is given 2 points. The validation of this scheme indicates low risk for a CHADS₂ score
of 0, moderate risk for a CHADS₂ score of 1 to 2, and high risk for a CHADS₂ score of >2 for future risk of
thromboembolic stroke.
The stroke rate per 100 patients-years without antithrombotic therapy according to CHADS₂ score is as
follows:
Score 0: stroke risk 1.9% (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0)
Score 1: stroke risk 2.8% (95% CI 2.0 to 3.8)
Score 2: stroke risk 4.0% (95% CI 3.1 to 5.1)
Score 3: stroke risk 5.9% (95% CI 4.6 to 7.3)
Score 4: stroke risk 8.5% (95% CI 6.3 to 11.1)
Score 5: stroke risk 12.5% (95% CI 8.2 to 17.5)
Score 6: stroke risk 18.2% (95% CI 10.5 to 27.4).
Risk factors for thromboembolism in patients with AF
The American College of Cardiology, AHA, ESC, and the Heart Rhythm Society, and the National Registry
of Atrial Fibrillation (NRAF) guidelines described the rationale for using anticoagulation based on risk factors
assessed by the CHADS and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores.[1] [92]

As well as guiding the need for treatment in once AF has occurred, the CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores
are also directly associated with the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation.[93]

HAS-BLED[94]
HAS-BLED is a scoring system in which the clinical characteristics of hypertension (H), abnormal renal or
hepatic function (A), stroke (S), bleeding or its risks (B), labile international normalized ratios (L), older age
group (>65 years) (E), and drugs/alcohol (drugs such as antiplatelets) (D) are given 1 point each. Based on
this scoring system, the risk of bleeding is significantly higher for scores of ≥3.
HEMORR2HAGES score system[92]  [HEMORR2HAGES calculator]
(https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1785/hemorr2hages-score-major-
bleeding-risk)
In addition to consideration of the risk of stroke and benefit of anticoagulation therapy, the risk of hemorrhage
(particularly intracranial) has to be considered. For patients taking warfarin, several scoring systems aim to
stratify this risk of bleeding. In the HEMORR2HAGES score, points are assigned for each risk factor: hepatic
or renal disease (H), ethanol abuse (E), malignancy (M), older age (>75 years) (O), reduced platelet count or
function (R), rebleeding risk (R), uncontrolled hypertension (H), anemia (A), genetic factor (G), excessive fall
risk (E), and stroke (S). One point is awarded for each risk factor, except for a prior bleed (rebleeding risk),
which is given 2 points.
Using this system, the risk of major bleeding in NRAF participants prescribed warfarin, stratified by
HEMORR2HAGES score, was as follows.
Bleeds per 100 point-years warfarin:
Score 0: 1.9 (95% CI 0.6 to 4.4)
Score 1: 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.3)
Score 2: 5.3 (95% CI 3.4 to 8.1)

Screening
Data from 17 studies involving 135,300 patients, mostly with chronic persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), showed
that systematic screening with ECG identified more new cases of AF than no screening, with an absolute
increase over 12 months of 0.6% to 2.8%.[95] However, one systematic approach using ECG did not detect
more cases than an approach using pulse palpation.[95] Another systematic review and meta-analysis found
that blood pressure monitors and non-12-lead ECGs were most accurate for detecting pulse irregularities
caused by AF.[96] Modalities recommended for monitoring for new AF in patients hospitalized for another
cause include episodic ECG or continuous ECG monitoring on telemetry; telemetry is more likely than
episodic ECG to detect AF in this setting.[43]
Studies assessing prolonged ECG monitoring (using a 30-day event-triggered recorder or an insertable
cardiac monitoring device) in patients with cryptogenic stroke have found AF to be common in these
patients.[9] [10] [11] Stroke may be the initial presentation of AF; even subclinical AF, detected in patients
with cardiac implantable electronic devices, is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Strategies for
primary preventative screening for AF in high-risk stroke patients, such as remote monitoring of heart
rhythm, can therefore be considered.[11] [74] [97]
There is no expert consensus or guideline recommendation on screening patients with asymptomatic AF in
the US, because current evidence is inadequate to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening
for AF.[98] One systematic review and meta-analysis does advocate routine screening for undiagnosed AF
from age 40, but large-scale screening of this nature is a difficult logistical and organizational undertaking.
Screening for AF may be appropriate in higher-risk groups (e.g., patients implanted with a pacemaker or
defibrillator) and can be performed with relative ease.[74] [99] In an observational study involving patients
receiving an implantable pacemaker, new-onset AF and long-term AF burden were frequently observed in
patients with heart block or sinus node disease, but were significantly more predominant in patients with
sinus node disease.[100]
Mobile health technologies, including smart devices, are a popular research area for AF detection.[75]
[76] There are currently >100,000 mobile health apps and ≥400 wearable activity monitors available. While
some studies have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting AF (including paroxysmal
AF, which is short-lived and can be difficult to capture on 12-lead ECG), many devices are not clinically
validated and caution is advised for clinical use.[2][77] [78] [101] If AF is detected by mobile or wearable
devices, diagnosis should always be confirmed with single-lead or 12-lead ECG analyzed by a physician with
expertise in ECG rhythm interpretation.[2]

New-onset atrial fibrillation Management
Approach
The main elements in the management of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) are:[1][102] [103] [104]
1. Ventricular rate control
2. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm
3. Prevention of thromboembolic events.
As an initial step, identification and treatment of any potential triggers of new-onset AF is very important,
because rate and rhythm control measures are less likely to succeed if the acute precipitant persists.[43]
Ventricular rate control
Management of new-onset AF depends on the nature of its presentation, so the urgency of the treatment
required should be assessed. Most cases of new-onset AF revert to sinus rhythm spontaneously, but
treatment may still be needed to restore adequate ventricular rate, with drugs such as beta-blockers,
calcium-channel blockers, and occasionally digoxin.[105] Digoxin is not considered a first-line agent for the
purpose of rate control, but it can be useful in patients with heart failure. One study explored whether digoxin
use was independently associated with increased mortality in patients with AF; compared with propensity
score–matched control participants, the risk of death and sudden death was significantly higher in new
digoxin users.[106] In patients with AF taking digoxin, the risk of death was independently related to serum
digoxin concentration and was highest in patients with concentrations of ≥1.2 ng/mL (≥1.54 nmol/L).[106]
Cases that revert spontaneously usually do so in the first 24 hours.[105] Patients whose AF does not
revert, or who present with significant symptoms and hemodynamic instability, may require either direct
current (DC) cardioversion or pharmacologic cardioversion.[1][105] There is no significant difference in
terms of outcome between DC and pharmacologic cardioversion. Timing of cardioversion in patients who
are hemodynamically stable and minimally symptomatic is a topic of research. Some studies suggest no
benefit of early cardioversion over a "wait and see" approach; others suggest outcomes are improved when
cardioversion is performed early.[107] [108] New-onset AF may be the first symptomatic presentation of
paroxysmal AF, in patients with high risk substrates of stroke, it is reasonable to perform transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) before cardioversion to rule out left atrial (LA) clots.[109]

Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm
Depending on further risks for AF, patients may require treatment with an antiarrhythmic agent to prevent
AF and maintain sinus rhythm once it has been restored.[1] Antiarrhythmics are reasonable for long-term
maintenance of sinus rhythm for patients with AF who are not candidates for, or decline, catheter ablation or
who prefer antiarrhythmic therapy.[1] For more information on this see Established atrial fibrillation .
One multicenter randomized control trial looked at outcomes of a strategy of initiating rhythm-control therapy
in patients with early AF (of less than 1 year duration). This study identified a reduced risk of death, from
cardiovascular causes, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure or acute coronary syndrome over 5 years
in patients who received early rhythm-control therapy.[110]
Prevention of thromboembolic events
Anticoagulation is recommended in patients with AF irrespective of whether the AF is paroxysmal, persistent,
or permanent, due to the high risk of thromboembolic events. Many patients require anticoagulation before,
during, and after cardioversion to prevent thromboembolism.[111] [112] [113] Selection of stroke risk
reduction therapy should be guided by the patient’s risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and their
individual preferences.[1] The key options for anticoagulation are a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin,
or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. Both vitamin

New-onset atrial fibrillation Management
K antagonists and DOACs are approved as efficacious agents for stroke prevention in AF and in patients
undergoing cardioversion.[1] [11] In patients with AF who are candidates for anticoagulation and do not have
either moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves, DOACs are recommended over
warfarin to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage.[1]
DOACs are nonvitamin K-dependent and they fall into two classes: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g.,
dabigatran) and oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban).[114] DOACs are
approved for stroke prevention and have a more favorable side-effect profile than vitamin K antagonists in
patients with nonvalvular AF. The fast onset of action of DOACs is also a benefit, which could reduce delays
to cardioversion, as well as negating the need for an interim alternative anticoagulant.[115] DOACs are
recommended over warfarin in eligible patients (i.e., patients who do not have moderate-to-severe mitral
stenosis or a mechanical heart valve).[1][116] [117] [118] The use of DOACs in this setting is supported by
data from several studies, most notably:
• The GARFIELD-AF study: a prospective registry of more than 52,000 patients with newly diagnosed
AF. Data from GARFIELD-AF suggest that DOACs are associated with lower risks of all-cause death
and bleeding than vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin.[119]
• The RE-LY trial: compared dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, with warfarin. The trial included
18,113 patients and had a median follow-up of 2 years.[104] The results of RE-LY suggest that
compared with warfarin, dabigatran showed noninferiority at a low dose, and superiority at a high dose
regarding rates of stroke and systemic embolism (warfarin 1.69% per year, lower-dose dabigatran
1.53% per year, and higher-dose dabigatran 1.11% per year for primary end point of stroke and
systemic embolism). Adverse bleeding event rates were lower with a lower dose and similar with a
higher dose of dabigatran compared with warfarin. The rate of myocardial infarction was higher with
both doses of dabigatran than with warfarin.[104] [114][120]
• The ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE-AF trials: the oral direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban,
apixaban, and edoxaban were compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with
nonvalvular AF in the ROCKET AF (14,264 patients, median follow-up of 1.9 years), ARISTOTLE
(18,201 patients, median follow-up of 1.8 years), and the ENGAGE-AF (21,105 patients, median
follow-up of 2.8 years) trials, respectively.[121] [122] [123] [124] The primary end point of stroke and/
or systemic embolism were 1.7% per year with rivaroxaban compared with 2.2% per year with warfarin
in the ROCKET AF trial, 1.3% per year with apixaban compared with 1.6% per year with warfarin in
the ARISTOTLE trial, and 1.6% per year with a lower dose and 1.2% per year with a higher dose of
edoxaban compared with 1.5% per year with warfarin in the ENGAGE-AF trial.[121] [122] [123] [124]
• One prospective cohort study comparing rivaroxaban to vitamin K antagonists for bleeding risk in
patients over 80 years of age, with nonvalvular AF: the primary end point of major bleeding occurred
in 6.5% of patients treated with rivaroxaban and 11.2% treated with vitamin K antagonists.[125]
Fatal bleeding occurred in 0.9% of rivaroxaban patients and 3.3% of patients treated with vitamin K
antagonists.[125]
These studies, together with results from meta-analyses and systematic reviews, have shown that DOACs
are noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF, and may be associated with
a reduced risk of fatal bleeding.[120] [125] [126] [127] [128] [Evidence A] It is, therefore, reasonable to use
DOACs as first-line agents or as a subsequent replacement for warfarin in patients with AF.[1] Based on
the current evidence, dabigatran is favored as a first-line agent or subsequent replacement for warfarin in
suitable patients who do not have marked renal insufficiency, and who do not have mechanical prosthetic
valves.[114] [120]

DOACs are generally safe in older patients; however, dabigatran may be associated with an increased risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin in patients ages >75 years.[129] [130] DOACs should
be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. In patients with nonvalvular AF and mild or moderate
renal impairment, the use of DOACs has been found to be associated with a reduced risk of stroke or
systemic embolism and a reduced risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, which suggests a favorable
risk profile of these agents in patients with mild-to-moderate renal disease.[131] Some DOACs may be used
in patients with renal impairment. If a DOAC is suitable, depending on the degree of renal impairment and
the indication for use, a dose adjustment may be required; consult the prescribing information for specific
guidance on use in patients with renal impairment. DOACs should not be used in patients with mechanical
prosthetic valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, due to an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, and
blood clot in these patients, nor should they be used in combination with heparin (including low molecular
weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.[111] Patients with diabetes are at risk of complications
of diabetes when treated with oral anticoagulants; this risk seems to be lower with DOACs compared with
vitamin K antagonists. Dabigatran is favored for its efficacy and lower rates of adverse effects in this patient
group.[132] [133]
Warfarin remains the first-line therapy in patients with AF and moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or
mechanical heart valves. Warfarin takes several days to have a therapeutic effect, so patients presenting
with new-onset AF treated with warfarin are treated with intravenous heparin (activated partial thromboplastin
time [aPTT] of 45-60 seconds) or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin while they are awaiting
cardioversion and being evaluated for long-term anticoagulation. Once the patient is established on warfarin,
the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation with warfarin is highly dependent on the quality of anticoagulation
control, as reflected by the average time in therapeutic range (TTR) of INR 2-3. The SAMe-TT₂R₂ scoring
system (based on sex, age, medical history, treatment interactions, tobacco use, and race) is a tool
that may help identify anticoagulation-naive patients who are less likely to maintain TTR >70% and who
should, therefore, be managed with DOACs instead of warfarin.[134] [135]  [SAMe-TT₂R₂ score] (http://
www.rcpe.ac.uk/resources/tools/same-tt2r2.html)
If there are no risk factors for stroke, aspirin (either alone or in combination with clopidogrel) is not
recommended to reduce the risk of stroke or to prevent thromboembolic events.[1]
The choice of anticoagulation strategy depends on the presentation. Factors in the patient's presentation and
diagnostic assessment that guide appropriate treatment include the following:
• Whether the patient is hemodynamically stable or unstable
• If hemodynamically stable, whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic
• If symptomatic, the onset of the symptoms (<48 hours, ≥48 hours, or unknown)
• The presence of associated heart failure
• The presence of a thrombus on TEE
• If a thrombus is absent on TEE, thromboembolic risk is stratified.
If the AF is of unknown duration, or if TEE cannot be performed, the patient should be treated as for
presumed thrombus and recommendations for confirmed LA thrombus should be followed.
In the setting of AF, the left atrial appendage can play a role in blood stasis and clot formation, and
consequently be a source of emboli.[11] Although oral anticoagulation is the standard of care to reduce
the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF, it is contraindicated in some patients due to an excess risk
of major bleeding.[1] Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) may be considered as an alternative for
stroke prevention in patients with a moderate to high risk of stroke (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2) when there
are absolute contraindications to the use of anticoagulants (due to a nonreversible cause), or the risk of

bleeding outweighs the benefits.[1] [2] [18][136] For more information on this treatment see Established atrial
fibrillation .
Need for hospital admission
Patients who present with new-onset AF who are at low risk for major clinical consequences (young
patients with no structural heart diseases, no major cardiac symptoms, or hemodynamic compromise)
may be discharged directly from the emergency department after stable sinus rhythm is restored.
Admission to the hospital is indicated for the following patient groups:
• Patients with underlying heart disease who have hemodynamic consequences or symptoms of
angina, heart failure, or syncope or who are at risk for a complication resulting from therapy of the
arrhythmia
• Older patients
• Associated or precipitant medical conditions that require further treatment, such as heart failure,
pulmonary problems (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism), hypertension, or hyperthyroidism.
Hemodynamically unstable AF
AF with a rapid ventricular rate causing ongoing chest pain, hypotension, shortness of breath, dizziness,
or syncope requires immediate DC cardioversion. This is performed under adequate short-acting general
anesthesia and involves delivery of an electrical shock synchronized with the intrinsic activity of the heart
by sensing the R wave of the ECG (i.e., synchronized). The energy output for successful termination of
new-onset AF varies from 200 J to a maximum of 400 J depending on the body size and the presence of
other comorbid conditions. Lower energy of 100 J may be used as the starting level when biphasic energy
is used.
For patients with hemodynamically unstable AF, initiation of anticoagulation should not delay DC
cardioversion. It is reasonable to consider administering an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin
followed by infusion, or low-molecular-weight heparin or DOAC and to continue this after cardioversion
unless contraindicated.[1]
Hemodynamically stable AF: symptomatic
Patients require rate-control therapy until cardioversion is successful. If there is no evidence of heart
failure, beta-blockers (e.g., intravenous esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol; oral atenolol, metoprolol,
nadolol, propranolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol) or nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (i.e.,
diltiazem, verapamil) are the preferred choice.[1] Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are
useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. They provide reasonable rate control
and also improve AF-related symptoms compared with beta-blockers.[1] If rate control is inadequate
with monotherapy, a combination of a beta-blocker and calcium-channel blockers may be used. Patients
should be carefully monitored to prevent excess atrioventricular nodal blockade.[1] If there is evidence
of decompensated heart failure, nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers are contraindicated.[1]
Certain beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone may be used for rate control in patients with AF and heart
failure.[1] [15]
Patients presenting with new-onset AF of <48 hours' duration and no evidence of LA thrombus on
TEE should have DC or pharmacologic cardioversion. DC cardioversion is fast, safe, and efficient.
Pharmacologic cardioversion is accomplished with the use of antiarrhythmic agents.[137] However,
these must be used with caution, as they may cause bradycardia or tachyarrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic

agents with variable, but demonstrated, efficacy for cardioversion of new-onset AF include flecainide,
propafenone, ibutilide, and amiodarone.[138] [139] [140] Class III agents (including amiodarone and
ibutilide) are less efficacious than class IC agents (flecainide and propafenone) in conversion to sinus
rhythm.[141] [142] [143] [144]
The strategy for managing anticoagulation in patients presenting with new-onset AF of <48 hours'
duration and with no evidence of LA thrombus is as follows:[1]
• If CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is 0-1, no anticoagulation is required.
• If CHA₂DS₂-VAS-VASc score is ≥2, intravenous heparin (aPTT of 45-60 seconds) or subcutaneous
low-molecular-weight heparin should be started before cardioversion. Once sinus rhythm is
restored, the patient should preferably be started on a DOAC, unless they are not eligible for a
DOAC (e.g., presence of moderate-to-severe mitral valve stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves),
or DOACs are unavailable. After the heparin is stopped, the first dose of the DOAC is usually given
at the next scheduled dose time; however, local guidance should be consulted for each DOAC. If
not using DOACs, start warfarin, and continue heparin until the warfarin levels are therapeutic (INR
2-3).
• DOACs should not be used in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or mitral stenosis.
In such cases, warfarin is the recommended anticoagulant. The concomitant use of DOACs
with heparin (including low molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin is not
recommended. DOACs should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment; consult
prescribing information for specific guidance.
• Anticoagulation should be established before cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks
afterward, and may be required for longer in some patients.[43][145]
If the onset of symptoms is 48 hours or more, a 3-week regimen of uninterrupted anticoagulant therapy
or imaging evaluation is recommended to rule out intracardiac thrombus before electively opting
for cardioversion.[1] CHA₂DS₂-VASc score also predicts risk of cardiovascular complications post
cardioversion.[146] The strategy for managing anticoagulation in these patients is as follows:
• If CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is 0-1, heparin should be started, and cardioversion should be delayed
until the patient is established on heparin with a target aPTT of 45-60 seconds. Following
successful cardioversion, heparin can be discontinued. There is currently no evidence to support
longer-term anticoagulation in patients with a score of 1 or lower. However, therapeutic decisions
should be based on an individual assessment of thromboembolic versus bleeding risk; long-term
anticoagulation is always required for patients with any form of cancer, irrespective of CHA₂DS₂-
VASc score, even after sinus rhythm has been restored.[145][147] [148] [149] If the decision is
made to continue long-term anticoagulation in patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1, DOACs
have a superior net benefit compared with vitamin K antagonists.[147] [148]
• If CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is ≥2, all eligible patients should preferably be started on a DOAC.[1]
 DOACs are recommended over warfarin in all cases other than for mitral stenosis and mechanical
heart valve.[28] If warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant, the target INR should be established
for 3-4 weeks before cardioversion is attempted.[28] DOACs should not be used in patients with
mechanical prosthetic valves and mitral stenosis.[1] The concomitant use of DOACs with heparin
(including low molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin is contraindicated. DOACs
should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment; consult prescribing information for
specific guidance.  
• Anticoagulation should be established before cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks
afterward, and may be required for longer in some patients.[1][43][145]

If there is evidence of LA thrombus on TEE, or the presence of thrombus is unknown or the duration of AF
is unknown or for 48 hours or more, all eligible patients should preferably be put on a DOAC for at least
3-6 weeks; after this, imaging such as TEE should be repeated to rule out intracardiac thrombus before
elective cardioversion.[1] [43]
Hemodynamically stable AF: asymptomatic
Patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc score 0-1 can be observed. Most cases of new-onset AF revert to sinus
rhythm spontaneously, usually in the first 24 hours.[105] If AF does not resolve spontaneously, rate-
control therapy is required until cardioversion is successful. However, rate- and rhythm-control strategies
have comparable clinical outcomes in many patients with AF; shared decision-making with the patient is
recommended.[1][105]
Anticoagulation should be established before cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks afterward,
and may be required for longer in some patients. If there is evidence of LA thrombus on TEE, or
the presence of thrombus is unknown or the duration of AF is unknown or for 48 hours or more, all
eligible patients should preferably be put on a DOAC for at least 3-6 weeks; after this, imaging such
as TEE should be repeated to rule out intracardiac thrombus before elective cardioversion. DOACs
are recommended over warfarin in all cases other than for mitral stenosis and mechanical heart valve.
DOACs should not be used in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves and mitral stenosis. Further, If
CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is ≥2, all eligible patients should preferably be started on a DOAC.[1] [43] 
Postcardioversion management
• Patients with a newly detected first episode of new-onset AF converted to sinus rhythm are usually
not continued on rhythm maintenance antiarrhythmic therapy. However, based on AF burden,
severity of presentation, and after shared decision, antiarrhythmics to maintain sinus rhythm
may be considered on an individual basis especially in patients who are deemed not suitable for
catheter ablation or those who refuse.
• Therapeutic decisions should always be based on an individual assessment of thromboembolic
versus bleeding risk.
• Long-term anticoagulation is required for patients with identified high risk for thromboembolism
(CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥1 in patients with nonvalvular AF, those with valvular AF, with prosthetic
mitral valve, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; any form of cancer irrespective of
CHA₂DS₂-VASc score), even after sinus rhythm has been restored.[1] [145] [147] [148] [149]

depending on the degree of renal impairment
and the indication for use, a dose adjustment
may be required. Consult the prescribing
information for specific guidance on use in
patients with renal impairment.
» DOACs should not be used in patients with
mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate-to-
severe mitral stenosis, due to an increased
risk of stroke, heart attack, and blood clot
in these patients, nor should they be used
in combination with heparin (including low
molecular weight heparin), heparin derivatives,
or warfarin.[111] Patients with diabetes are at
risk of complications of diabetes when treated
with oral anticoagulants; this risk seems to be
lower with DOACs compared with vitamin K
antagonists. Dabigatran is favored for its efficacy
and lower rates of adverse effects in this patient
group.[132] [133]
» In DOAC-ineligible patients, start concomitant
heparin and warfarin therapy, and continue
heparin until the warfarin levels are therapeutic
(INR 2-3). Anticoagulation with warfarin at the
target INR should be established for 3-4 weeks
before cardioversion is attempted.
» Anticoagulation should be established before
and is recommended to be continued for at
least 4 weeks after cardioversion, and may be

 Although oral anticoagulation is the standard

» Beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone may
be used for rate control in patients with AF and
heart failure.[1] [15] These drugs may be used in
combination or as monotherapy. 
» Choice of pharmacologic agent/s in patients
with heart failure is dictated by the degree
of heart failure and type of heart failure (i.e.,
reduced or preserved ejection fraction [EF]).
Drugs that potentially accentuate cardiac
contractility are therefore avoided. Thus,
calcium-channel blockers, which may be used
in heart failure (HF) with preserved EF, are not
recommended in patients with reduced EF (heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]).

Beta-blockers such as carvedilol, metoprolol,

patients with reduced and preserved EF may be
used for rate control as well.
» Digoxin is not considered a first-line agent
for the purpose of rate control, but it can be
useful in patients with heart failure. One study
explored whether digoxin use was independently
associated with increased mortality in patients
with AF; compared with propensity score–
matched control participants, the risk of
death and sudden death was significantly
higher in new digoxin users.[106] In patients
with AF taking digoxin, the risk of death
was independently related to serum digoxin
concentration and was highest in patients with
concentrations of ≥1.2 ng/mL (≥1.54 nmol/
L).[106]

any potential triggers of new-onset AF is very
important, because rate and rhythm control

» Anticoagulation is recommended in all patients
with AF due to the high risk of thromboembolic
events. The key options for anticoagulation are a
vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, or a direct
oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran,
rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. DOACs
are approved for stroke prevention and have a
more favorable side-effect profile than vitamin K
antagonists in patients with nonvalvular AF.
» In patients with AF who are candidates
for anticoagulation and do not have either
moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis
or mechanical heart valves, DOACs are
recommended over warfarin to reduce the risk
of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and
intracranial hemorrhage.[1]
» DOACs should be used with caution in patients
with renal impairment. If a DOAC is suitable,
depending on the degree of renal impairment
and the indication for use, a dose adjustment
may be required. Consult the prescribing
information for specific guidance on use in
patients with renal impairment.
» DOACs should not be used in patients with
mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate-to-
severe mitral stenosis, due to an increased risk
of stroke, heart attack, and blood clot in these
patients, nor should they be used in combination
with heparin (including low molecular weight
heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.[111]
» Patients with diabetes are at risk of
complications of diabetes when treated with
oral anticoagulants; this risk seems to be
lower with DOACs compared with vitamin K
antagonists. Dabigatran is favored for its efficacy
and lower rates of adverse effects in this patient
group.[132] [133]
» In DOAC-ineligible patients, start concomitant
heparin and warfarin therapy, and continue
heparin until the warfarin levels are therapeutic

» Anticoagulation should be established prior

» In the setting of AF, the left atrial appendage
can play a role in blood stasis and clot formation,
and consequently be a source of emboli.[11]
 Although oral anticoagulation is the standard
of care to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke
in patients with AF, it is contraindicated in
some patients due to an excess risk of major
bleeding.[1]
» Left atrial appendage occlusion may be
considered as an alternative for stroke
prevention in patients with a moderate to high
risk of stroke (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2) when
there are absolute contraindications to the use of
anticoagulants (due to a nonreversible cause), or
the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits.[1] [2]

95% CI 2.6 to 8.2). High conversion rates of up
to 76% at 8 hours after treatment.[150]
» Class III agents (including amiodarone and
ibutilide) are less efficacious than class IC
agents in conversion to sinus rhythm.
» To improve success of restoration of sinus
rhythm and its maintenance, especially in
patients with persistent AF, pre-treatment
with amiodarone 1-6 weeks before electrical
cardioversion may be considered.[1] [151]
» Ibutilide prolongs repolarization of the
atrial tissue by enhancing the slow inward
depolarizing Na+ current in the plateau phase
of repolarization. Up to 70% of all conversions
occur within 20 minutes of infusion. It has
strong evidence of efficacy for pharmacologic
conversion (OR 29.1, 95% CI 9.8 to 86.1).
Conversion rates are between 33% and 45%
within the first 70 minutes. Because the half-life
of ibutilide is 3 to 6 hours, prolonged observation
period is recommended in patients who have
received ibutilide.[150]

» Anticoagulation is recommended in all patients
with AF due to the high risk of thromboembolic
events. The key options for anticoagulation are a
vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, or a direct
oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran,
rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. DOACs
are approved for stroke prevention and have a
more favorable side-effect profile than vitamin K
antagonists in patients with nonvalvular AF.
» In patients with AF who are candidates
for anticoagulation and do not have either
moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis
or mechanical heart valves, DOACs are
recommended over warfarin to reduce the risk
of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and

information for specific guidance on use in
patients with renal impairment.
» DOACs should not be used in patients with
mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate-to-
severe mitral stenosis, due to an increased risk
of stroke, heart attack, and blood clot in these
patients, nor should they be used in combination
with heparin (including low molecular weight
heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.[111]
» Patients with diabetes are at risk of
complications of diabetes when treated with
oral anticoagulants; this risk seems to be
lower with DOACs compared with vitamin K
antagonists. Dabigatran is favored for its efficacy
and lower rates of adverse effects in this patient
group.[132] [133]
» In DOAC-ineligible patients, start concomitant
heparin and warfarin therapy, and continue
heparin until the warfarin levels are therapeutic
(INR 2-3). Anticoagulation with warfarin at the
target INR should be established for 3-4 weeks
before cardioversion is attempted.
» Anticoagulation is continued for at least 4
weeks after cardioversion, and may be required
for longer in some patients.[1] [43]
» In the setting of AF, the left atrial appendage
can play a role in blood stasis and clot formation,
and consequently be a source of emboli.[11]
 Although oral anticoagulation is the standard
of care to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke
in patients with AF, it is contraindicated in
some patients due to an excess risk of major
bleeding.[1]
» Left atrial appendage occlusion may be
considered as an alternative for stroke
prevention in patients with a moderate to high
risk of stroke (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2) when
there are absolute contraindications to the use of
anticoagulants (due to a nonreversible cause), or
the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits.[1] [2]

» Patients with heart failure are considered
at high risk of thromboembolism. Additional
risk factors may also be present, including
age ≥75 years, structural heart disease,
diabetes, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease,
prosthetic heart valves, or history of prior
thromboembolism, and left ventricular ejection
fraction is ≤35%.
» Beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone may
be used for rate control in patients with AF and
heart failure.[1] [15] These drugs may be used in
combination or as monotherapy.
» Choice of pharmacologic agent/s in patients
with heart failure is dictated by the degree
of heart failure and type of heart failure (i.e.,
reduced or preserved ejection fraction [EF]).
Drugs that potentially accentuate cardiac
contractility are therefore avoided. Thus,
calcium-channel blockers, which may be used
in heart failure (HF) with preserved EF, are not
recommended in patients with reduced EF (heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]).
Beta-blockers such as carvedilol, metoprolol,
and bisoprolol that are recommended for HF in
patients with reduced and preserved EF may be
used for rate control as well.

» In patients with AF who are candidates
for anticoagulation and do not have either
moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis
or mechanical heart valves, DOACs are
recommended over warfarin to reduce the risk
of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and
intracranial hemorrhage.[1]
» DOACs should be used with caution in patients
with renal impairment. If a DOAC is suitable,
depending on the degree of renal impairment
and the indication for use, a dose adjustment
may be required. Consult the prescribing
information for specific guidance on use in
patients with renal impairment.
» DOACs should not be used in patients with
mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate-to-
severe mitral stenosis, due to an increased risk
of stroke, heart attack, and blood clot in these
patients, nor should they be used in combination
with heparin (including low molecular weight
heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.[111]
» Patients with diabetes are at risk of
complications of diabetes when treated with
oral anticoagulants; this risk seems to be
lower with DOACs compared with vitamin K
antagonists. Dabigatran is favored for its efficacy
and lower rates of adverse effects in this patient
group.[132] [133]
» In DOAC-ineligible patients, start concomitant
heparin and warfarin therapy, and continue
heparin until the warfarin levels are therapeutic
(INR 2-3). Anticoagulation with warfarin at the
target INR should be established for 3-4 weeks
before cardioversion is attempted.
» Anticoagulation should be established before
and is recommended to be continued for at
least 4 weeks after cardioversion, and may be
required for longer in some patients.[1] [43]
» In the setting of AF, the left atrial appendage
can play a role in blood stasis and clot formation,
and consequently be a source of emboli.[11]
 Although oral anticoagulation is the standard
of care to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke
in patients with AF, it is contraindicated in
some patients due to an excess risk of major
bleeding.[1]
» Left atrial appendage occlusion may be
considered as an alternative for stroke
prevention in patients with a moderate to high
risk of stroke (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2) when

agents in conversion to sinus rhythm.
» To improve success of restoration of sinus
rhythm and its maintenance, especially in

» Patients with heart failure are considered
at high risk of thromboembolism. Additional
risk factors may also be present, including
age ≥75 years, structural heart disease,
diabetes, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease,
prosthetic heart valves, or history of prior
thromboembolism, and left ventricular ejection
fraction is ≤35%.
» Beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone may
be used for rate control in patients with AF and
heart failure.[1] These drugs may be used in
combination or as monotherapy. 
» Choice of pharmacologic agent/s in patients
with heart failure is dictated by the degree
of heart failure and type of heart failure (i.e.,
reduced or preserved ejection fraction [EF]).
Drugs that potentially accentuate cardiac
contractility are therefore avoided. Thus,
calcium-channel blockers, which may be used
in heart failure (HF) with preserved EF, are not
recommended in patients with reduced EF (heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]).
Beta-blockers such as carvedilol, metoprolol,
and bisoprolol that are recommended for HF in
patients with reduced and preserved EF may be
used for rate control as well.
» Digoxin is not considered a first-line agent
for the purpose of rate control, but it can be
useful in patients with heart failure. One study
explored whether digoxin use was independently
associated with increased mortality in patients
with AF; compared with propensity score–
matched control participants, the risk of
death and sudden death was significantly
higher in new digoxin users.[106] In patients
with AF taking digoxin, the risk of death
was independently related to serum digoxin
concentration and was highest in patients with
concentrations of ≥1.2 ng/mL (≥1.54 nmol/
L).[106]

» Flecainide has strong evidence of efficacy for
pharmacologic conversion (odds ratio [OR] 24.7,
95% CI 9.0 to 68.3). High conversion rate of
about 70% at 3 hours after treatment and up to
90% at 8 hours.[150]
» Propafenone also has strong evidence of
efficacy for pharmacologic conversion (OR 4.6,
95% CI 2.6 to 8.2). High conversion rates of up
to 76% at 8 hours after treatment.[150]
» Class III agents (including amiodarone and
ibutilide) are less efficacious than class IC
agents in conversion to sinus rhythm.
» To improve success of restoration of sinus
rhythm and its maintenance, especially in
patients with persistent AF, pre-treatment
with amiodarone 1-6 weeks before electrical
cardioversion may be considered.[1] [151]
» Ibutilide prolongs repolarization of the
atrial tissue by enhancing the slow inward
depolarizing Na+ current in the plateau phase
of repolarization. Up to 70% of all conversions
occur within 20 minutes of infusion. It has
strong evidence of efficacy for pharmacologic
conversion (OR 29.1, 95% CI 9.8 to 86.1).
Conversion rates are between 33% and 45%
within the first 70 minutes. Because the half-life

» Patients with higher thromboembolic risk
require immediate anticoagulation.
» The key options for anticoagulation are a
vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, or a direct
oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as dabigatran,
rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban. DOACs
are approved for stroke prevention and have a
more favorable side-effect profile than vitamin K
antagonists in patients with nonvalvular AF.
» In patients with AF who are candidates
for anticoagulation and do not have either
moderate-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis
or mechanical heart valves, DOACs are
recommended over warfarin to reduce the risk
of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and
intracranial hemorrhage.[1] If CHA₂DS₂-VASc
score is ≥2, all eligible patients should preferably
be started on a DOAC.
» DOACs should be used with caution in patients
with renal impairment. If a DOAC is suitable,
depending on the degree of renal impairment
and the indication for use, a dose adjustment
may be required. Consult the prescribing
information for specific guidance on use in
patients with renal impairment.
» DOACs should not be used in patients with
mechanical prosthetic valves or moderate-to-
severe mitral stenosis, due to an increased risk
of stroke, heart attack, and blood clot in these
patients, nor should they be used in combination
with heparin (including low molecular weight
heparin), heparin derivatives, or warfarin.[111]

oral anticoagulants; this risk seems to be
lower with DOACs compared with vitamin K
antagonists. Dabigatran is favored for its efficacy
and lower rates of adverse effects in this patient
group.[132] [133]
» In DOAC-ineligible patients, start concomitant
heparin and warfarin therapy, and continue
heparin until the warfarin levels are therapeutic
(INR 2-3). Anticoagulation with warfarin at the
target INR should be established for 3-4 weeks
before cardioversion is attempted.
» Anticoagulation is continued for at least 4
weeks after cardioversion (in patients who
require cardioversion), and may be required for
longer in some patients.[1] [43]
» In the setting of AF, the left atrial appendage
can play a role in blood stasis and clot formation,
and consequently be a source of emboli.[11]
 Although oral anticoagulation is the standard
of care to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke
in patients with AF, it is contraindicated in
some patients due to an excess risk of major
bleeding.[1]
» Left atrial appendage occlusion may be
considered as an alternative for stroke
prevention in patients with a moderate to high
risk of stroke (CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥2) when
there are absolute contraindications to the use of
anticoagulants (due to a nonreversible cause), or
the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefits.[1] [2]

» Most cases of new-onset AF revert to sinus
rhythm spontaneously. Cases that revert
spontaneously usually do so in the first 24
hours.[105]
» Patients should be observed to see whether
AF resolves spontaneously.
» In addition, identification and treatment of
any potential triggers of new-onset AF is very
important, because rate and rhythm control
measures are less likely to succeed, and AF is
less likely to resolve spontaneously, if the acute
precipitant persists.[43]

Acute
» If AF does not resolve spontaneously, rate-
control therapy is required until cardioversion is
successful.
» Beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium-
channel blockers (i.e., diltiazem or verapamil)
slow atrioventricular nodal conduction of cardiac
impulses and subsequently reduce ventricular
rate.
» Intravenous administration may be necessary
for rapid control of ventricular rate. Furthermore,
in the event of hemodynamic adverse effects,
the infusion may be discontinued promptly.
» Beta-blockers are particularly useful when
new-onset AF is associated with an acute
myocardial infarction or angina, and when new-
onset AF is precipitated after exercise.
» Esmolol is useful in patients at risk of
complications from beta-blockade, particularly
those with reactive airway disease, left
ventricular dysfunction, and/or peripheral
vascular disease.
» Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers
are useful in ventricular rate control in the
absence of preexcitation. They provide
reasonable rate control and also improve
AF-related symptoms compared with beta-
blockers.[1] They are preferred in patients with
chronic lung disease where bronchospasm may
occur with beta-blockers.

Emerging
Vernakalant
Intravenous vernakalant has demonstrated superior efficacy to amiodarone or placebo for acute conversion
of recent-onset AF. Intravenous vernakalant was no different in efficacy at rhythm conversion to ibutilide.[152]
[153] Oral vernakalant appears to be effective in preventing AF recurrence post-cardioversion.[154] While
some studies suggest there is no significant difference in the safety of vernakalant compared with other
drugs used for pharmacologic cardioversion of AF, further research is needed to clarify its safety profile.[155]
[156] Oral vernakalant is not currently available in the US.
Colchicine
Inflammation is implicated in AF pathophysiology and stroke risk in anticoagulated patients, so studies are
looking at treatments targeting inflammation to reduce markers of inflammation and thrombosis in patients
with AF.[11] Data from randomized control trials suggests that treatment with colchicine may reduce adverse
cardiovascular outcomes in patients with established cardiovascular disease, as well as potentially being
effective for preventing early recurrences of AF after catheter ablation.[11] In the context of postoperative
prophylaxis of AF following cardiac surgery, data supporting use of colchicine have not been found to be
robust.[43]
Factor XI inhibitors
Factor XI has been identified as a promising target for safer anticoagulants, having significant affinity for
thrombotic mechanisms, but a limited role in hemostasis.[11]
Primary prevention
Primary prevention strategies are based on reducing risk factors through lifestyle modification. Modifying
diet to promote weight loss, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, treating identified risk factors such as
obstructive sleep apnea and hyperlipidemia, and regular moderate physical exercise may all reduce the risk
of developing cardiovascular disease, including AF.[11] [43][47] [59] [60] [62] [70] [71] [72] [73]
The table that follows summarizes recommendations for primary prevention of AF taken from the ACC/
AHA/ACCP/HRS (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American College of
Clinical Pharmacy/Heart Rhythm Society) guideline for the diagnosis and management of AF.[1]
Note that an individual patient may fall into more than one group and so interventions might be additive;
please review all population and subpopulation groups to assess all that apply.
Adult; with risk factors for AF
Risk factors for AF include (but are not limited to): advancing age; smoking; sedentary lifestyle
or elite/extreme exercise; increasing alcohol use; obesity or overweight; increasing height;

elevated blood pressure and hypertension; diabetes; presence of cardiovascular disease (e.g.,
coronary artery disease, heart failure); thyroid disease.
With hypertension
Intervention Goal
Blood pressure control
Optimize blood pressure control using lifestyle
interventions with or without antihypertensive
medication to reduce blood pressure in line with
published clinical guidance on management of
hypertension.
Hypertension is the risk factor with the highest
attributable risk for AF; intensive blood pressure
control lowers the risk of incident AF in
observational and randomized data.
See Essential hypertension .
Blood pressure reduction and prevention of
AF
Follow recommendations on blood pressure targets
for the general population in line with published
clinical guidance on management of hypertension.
With overweight or obesity
Intervention Goal
Weight loss
Follow guideline-directed advice on achieving
weight loss, which may include lifestyle measures
with or without consideration of pharmacotherapy or
surgery.
Management of weight is important in the
prevention and treatment of AF. Obesity results in
direct changes to the atrial myocardium forming
the substrate for AF. In addition, obesity is
also associated with several comorbidities that
have been independently associated with the
development of AF.
See Obesity in adults .
Weight loss and prevention of AF
Follow recommendations on healthy body weight
targets for the general population in line with
published clinical guidance.
Physically inactive
Intervention Goal
Counseling on maintenance of a physically
active lifestyle
Encourage the individual to engage in physical
activity. A physically active lifestyle is recommended
to reduce the risk of development of AF, particularly
if the person is sedentary.
Increased physical activity and prevention of
AF
Physical activity is recommended in line with
physical activity targets for the general population.

With alcohol consumption
Intervention Goal
Advice on safe drinking levels
Counsel the individual to drink moderately (or
abstain from alcohol) and to avoid binge drinking.
It may be appropriate to explain that alcohol
consumption enhances the risk of AF in a linear
fashion, with clear evidence that binge drinking
heightens the risk.
One standard alcoholic drink/day is the maximum
recommended amount to reduce the risk of
AF development, although uncertainty persists
regarding harms or benefits of drinking this amount
daily.
See Alcohol use disorder .
Adherence to safe drinking guidance
Advise patients to limit their alcohol intake to ≤1
standard alcoholic drink/day, or to abstain from
alcohol.
With suspected or confirmed substance use disorder
Intervention Goal
Consider referral for substance use disorder
treatment
Refer the patient with suspected or confirmed
substance use disorder for treatment as appropriate.
Treatment for substance use disorder may be
beneficial in reducing the risk of AF given that
there is an association of cannabis, cocaine,
methamphetamine, and opioid use with increased
incidence of AF.

Intervention Goal
Smoking cessation counseling and/or

With diabetes
Intervention Goal
Optimize glycemic control
Follow guideline-directed management of diabetes
according to the subtype of diabetes present,
including lifestyle interventions with or without
pharmacotherapy.
The presence of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes
increases AF risk, with evidence that worse glucose
control correlates with a higher probability of
developing AF.
There is limited evidence to suggest that taking a
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor
may prevent new AF in people with type 2 diabetes,
although the evidence is not strong enough to offer
a definitive recommendation to support the use of
SGLT2 inhibitors for AF prevention.

Undergoing cardiac surgery
Intervention Goal
Consider short-term prophylactic

concomitant posterior left pericardectomy in
selected patients
If a patient is undergoing cardiac surgery, it is
reasonable for the hospital team to administer short-
term prophylactic beta-blockers or amiodarone to
reduce the incidence of postoperative AF.
Furthermore, it is reasonable for the surgical team to
perform concomitant posterior left pericardiectomy
to reduce the incidence of postoperative AF in
people undergoing:
• A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
• Aortic valve, or ascending aortic aneurysm
operations
New-onset AF after cardiac surgery is common and
has been associated with increased risks of late
mortality and stroke.
Trials of prophylactic amiodarone and beta-blockers
have demonstrated effectiveness reducing the
occurrence of new AF, but not in all studies.

Initiated on cancer therapy associated with an increased risk of developing AF
Intervention Goal
Consider cardiology referral for evaluation
and optimization of cardiovascular risk
factors
If the patient is taking medical cancer therapies that
increase the risk of incident AF, consider referral
to a cardiologist, as required, for optimization of
cardiovascular conditions.
Implicated medical cancer therapies include:
• Anthracyclines
• Antimetabolites
• Alkylating agents
• Immunomodulatory drugs
• Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
• Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
therapy
• Monoclonal antibodies
Notably, Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors,
such as ibrutinib, which are used to treat chronic
lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoproliferative
malignancies and often used for an extended period
of time, are associated with a higher risk of AF due
to off-target cardiac effects.
Patients with cancer and AF are on average
older and have higher rates of hypertension,
myocardial infarction, and heart failure compared
with those who do not develop AF. In general,
patients with cancer and cardiovascular disease
may be undertreated with guideline-directed medical
therapy and infrequently referred to specialists for
cardiovascular care.
The presence of raised natriuretic peptides after
major thoracic cancer surgery may indicate a higher
risk of AF.

MANAGEMENT
With bradycardia requiring cardiac-implanted electronic device (pacemaker); with normal
atrioventricular conduction
Intervention Goal
Device selection and programming strategy
to maintain atrioventricular synchrony
It is recommended that the specialized healthcare
team consider:
• using programming strategies that minimize
right ventricular pacing to reduce the risk of
AF, and
• implementing antitachycardia pacing
algorithms (where appropriate) to identify and
terminate atrial arrhythmias, e.g., in people
with organized atrial activation due to reentry.
Reduced incidence of AF
Secondary prevention
Risk factor and lifestyle modification is key to long-term success of cardioversion of AF and prevention of AF
recurrence.[43][47] [73] Weight reduction to a normal body mass index with intensive risk factor management
has been shown to reduce atrial fibrillation symptom burden and severity, and result in beneficial cardiac
remodeling.[43][47] [162] [168] [169] In patients with cardiovascular risk factors, treatment with statins can
protect against recurrent AF.[47] Abstinence from alcohol can increase the success of maintaining sinus
rhythm following ablation or while on treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs.[47] [73] [162] Appropriate use of
continuous positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea can also help maintain sinus
rhythm following treatment for AF.[43][47] [73] ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists may be
of value in primary and secondary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure.[170]
Patient discussions
Patients who have identifiable and known triggers to AF, such as alcohol, stimulants, caffeine, or nicotine,
should be advised to avoid such triggers to help prevent recurrence.

New-onset atrial fibrillation Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients presenting with new-onset AF who have paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF need
long-term follow-up. Depending on the nature of the underlying cause of AF (i.e., coronary artery
disease, valvular heart disease, or heart failure), patients should have regular (minimum 6-12 months)
echocardiograms and consideration of exercise stress testing. Risk factors for thromboembolism and
bleeding change with time; patients should be reassessed at regular intervals, including re-calculation
of the CHADS2-VASC score and HASBLED score. This is to ensure the patient remains on the most
appropriate treatment long term, and so that modifiable risk factors can be addressed.[167]
Patients who are taking antiarrhythmic agents need follow-up for ECG monitoring. Exercise stress testing
is recommended to assess for use-dependence proarrhythmia of ventricular tachycardia in patients taking
flecainide and propafenone.
A regular follow-up to check and monitor the international normalized ratio is mandatory for those patients
who are taking warfarin for anticoagulation. Routine monitoring of digoxin levels is not required but levels
can be checked if toxicity or inadequate dosing is suspected.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
acute stroke short term low
Patients usually have paroxysmal to persistent AF with risk factors to thromboembolic events, such as left
atrial dilation, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and advanced age.
Controversy exists regarding the treatment of established embolic acute stroke in the presence of new-
onset AF. Anticoagulation in this setting may cause hemorrhagic stroke. Consultation with a specialist
(neurologist) is highly recommended. Novel approaches to interrupt thrombus propagation by intravascular
devices are being studied.
myocardial infarction (MI) short term low
Rapid ventricular rate and increased myocardial demand may lead to acute MI in people with coronary
artery disease.[166]
congestive heart failure short term low
Rapid ventricular rate, increased myocardial demand, and unfavorable hemodynamics may lead to
acute heart failure in people with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and valvular
pathology.[166]

New-onset atrial fibrillation Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Prognosis
The prognosis of new-onset AF is not a well evaluated area. Prognosis depends on several factors, such
as the precipitating event, underlying cardiac status, risk of thromboembolism, and whether the nature of
the AF is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.[161] As well as its role in predicting thromboembolic risk,
the CHA2DS2-VASc score is also useful at predicting recurrence of AF after electrical or pharmacologic
cardioversion, with a score of ≥2 associated with a 37% increase in the risk of arrhythmia recurrence.[161]
In young patients with no structural cardiac abnormalities who have an episode of new-onset AF as a result
of alcohol bingeing, prognosis is excellent with avoidance of alcohol. Even in patients for whom alcohol was
not a precipitant of AF, abstinence from alcohol can help reduce the risk of AF recurrence, and of ischemic
stroke.[24] [25] [47] [162] In contrast, short- and long-term prognosis for patients presenting with new
onset of AF with heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) is poor. Furthermore, a meta-analysis has
shown that there is an increased risk of mortality with the presence of AF in the setting of MI, which persists
regardless of the timing of AF.[163] Patients with prior AF or new-onset AF following MI need close clinical
follow-up. One systematic review identified lower socioeconomic status as a risk factor for poor outcomes in
AF.[164] Patients with a normal body mass index have the best outcomes in AF, with studies suggesting that
the extremes of weight, either under- or overweight, are associated with a worse prognosis in AF.[165]

Evidence tables
How do factor Xa inhibitors compare with warfarin for prevention of cerebral
and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation (AF)?
This table is a summary of the analysis reported in a Cochrane Clinical Answer that focuses on the
above important clinical question.

Note
The Cochrane review which underpins this Cochrane Clinical Answer (CCA) advises caution when
interpreting the net clinical benefit of factor Xa Inhibitors for people with a very low risk of thromboembolic
events, severe renal impairment, or those on hemodialysis, as in general they were excluded from the
analyzed studies.
ᵃ  The CCA notes that most of the participants within the studies were men between the ages of 65 and 74
years of age with an unknown duration of AF, resulting in some uncertainty over the generalizability of these
results.
ᵇ  The CCA also notes that different definitions of disabling stroke were used in included studies which might
affect the interpretation/relevance of this outcome.
ᶜ  A subgroup analysis of people receiving idraparinux (currently in development) resulted in more major
bleeds, intracranial hemorrhage, or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeds in this group than in people receiving
dose-adjusted warfarin. However, the Cochrane review which underpins this CCA notes that the majority of
the included data was for apixaban (18,358 participants), edoxaban (22,922 participants), and rivaroxaban
(15,514 participants).
ᵈ  The Cochrane review reports high heterogeneity for major bleeding when using a fixed-effects model; due
to this high heterogeneity an analysis using a random-effects model was also carried out which did not show
a statistically significant difference between treatment groups.
* Evidence levels
The Evidence level is an internal rating applied by BMJ Best Practice. See the EBM Toolkit (https://
bestpractice.bmj.com/info/evidence-tables/) for details.
Confidence in evidence
A -  High or moderate to high
B -  Moderate or low to moderate
C -  Very low or low

† Effectiveness (BMJ rating)
Based on statistical significance, which demonstrates that the results are unlikely to be due to chance, but
which does not necessarily translate to a clinical significance.
‡ Grade certainty ratings
High The authors are very confident that the true
effect is similar to the estimated effect.
Moderate The authors are moderately confident that
the true effect is likely to be close to the
estimated effect.
Low The authors have limited confidence in the
effect estimate and the true effect may be
substantially different.
Very Low The authors have very little confidence in
the effect estimate and the true effect is
likely to be substantially different.

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To

quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
