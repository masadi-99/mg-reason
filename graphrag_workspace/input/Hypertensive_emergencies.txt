Hypertensive emergencies Overview
Summary
Hypertensive emergency is severely elevated blood pressure (BP) associated with new or progressive target
organ dysfunction.
If the clinical suspicion is high, treatment should be initiated immediately without waiting for further tests.
BP must be lowered over minutes to hours with parenteral medications in an intensive care setting.
The initial goal of therapy is to reduce mean arterial BP by no more than 25% (within minutes to 1 hour). If
the patient remains stable, further reduce the BP to 160 mmHg systolic and 100-110 mmHg diastolic within
the next 2 to 6 hours. Normal BP may be targeted over the next 24 to 48 hours.
Excessive falls in pressure may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia and so should be avoided.
Exceptions to this general rule are patients with aortic dissection, pheochromocytoma crisis, and severe
preeclampsia or eclampsia. Selected patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage may also require
acute blood pressure lowering; careful titration in these patients is required to ensure continuous smooth and
sustained control of BP.
With appropriate treatment, prognosis is good.
Definition
Hypertensive emergency is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (BP) associated with new or
progressive target organ dysfunction. Although the absolute value of the BP is not as important as the
presence of end-organ damage, the systolic BP is usually >180 mmHg and/or the diastolic BP is >120
mmHg.[1]

Hypertensive emergencies Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
The worldwide prevalence of hypertension is around 31%, exceeding 1.3 billion people.[2] [3] [4] Of these,
1% to 2% will suffer a hypertensive crisis in their lifetime.[5] [6] Rates of hypertensive emergencies have
increased over the past 20 years; however, mortality rates have decreased and range from 0.2% to 11.0%.[7]
[8] [9]
Men may be more likely than women to suffer a hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency is more
common in older patients and in black people.[10] [11] [12] [13] Preeclampsia complicates 2% to 8% of
pregnancies globally.[14] Preeclampsia is more prevalent among African American women than among
white women.[15] [16] [17] Differences in prevalence may be, in part, due to African American women being
disproportionately affected by risk factors for preeclampsia.[16] African American women also have case
fatality rates related to preeclampsia three times higher than rates among white women.[16] Inequalities in
access to adequate prenatal care may contribute to poor outcomes associated with preeclampsia in African
American women.[16] However, UK data concerning ethnic differences in hypertension prevalence and
complications are inconsistent.[18] [19] [20]
Lack of insurance or a primary care doctor and nonadherence to treatment all predispose toward
development of hypertensive emergency.[21] [22] As populations age globally, the prevalence of
hypertension and therefore hypertensive emergency is expected to increase.[3]
Etiology
Essential hypertension that is either undiagnosed or inadequately treated is a common cause of hypertensive
emergency.[12] [21] [22] [23] Another common cause is secondary and resistant hypertension.
System disorders that can lead to a presentation of hypertensive emergency include:
• Renal disease (underlying chronic disease, renal artery stenosis, acute glomerulonephritis, collagen-
vascular diseases, kidney transplantation)[24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]
• Neurologic (head trauma, spinal cord injury, autonomic dysfunction)[31]
• Respiratory (obstructive sleep apnea)[32] [33] [34]
• Immunologic (scleroderma, vasculitis)[31]
• Endocrine (primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, thyroid disorder, Cushing syndrome,
acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism, carcinoid tumor, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or renin-secreting
tumor).[31] [35] [36][37]
Pregnancy-related preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome, and
eclampsia are also important causes of hypertensive emergency in women.[31]
Lifestyle choices should also be considered when trying to determine the potential cause of a hypertensive
emergency as excessive dietary salt intake, obesity, and/or alcohol consumption can all contribute to
hypertension.[38] A thorough medication history must also be obtained as hypertension can be induced or
exacerbated by certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives,
sympathomimetics, illicit drugs, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, erythropoietin,
herbal supplements, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, and inadvertent drug or food interactions
with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.[7][31] [39]

Hypertensive emergencies Theory
Pathophysiology
The factors that lead to the development of hypertensive emergency are poorly understood. A rise in
systemic vascular resistance, resulting from a combination of humoral vasoconstrictor increase and
autoregulatory failure, initiates the cycle. The subsequent increase in blood pressure generates mechanical
stress and endothelial injury leading to increased permeability, activation of the coagulation cascade and
platelets, deposition of fibrin, and inflammatory cytokine induction. These processes result in ischemia
and the release of additional vasoactive mediators generating ongoing injury. Volume depletion caused by
pressure natriuresis and activation of the renin-angiotensin system often lead to further vasoconstriction.
Systemic vasoconstriction leads to decreased blood flow to vital organs and the subsequent end-organ injury
that is the hallmark of hypertensive emergency. End-organ injury primarily affects the neurologic, cardiac,
and renal systems.[39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45]
Case history
Case history #1
A 50-year-old black man with a history of untreated hypertension presents to the emergency room with
substernal chest pressure. His symptoms started the previous day. The pain was initially intermittent in
nature but has become constant and radiates to his jaw and left shoulder. He also complains of dizziness
and some shortness of breath. Apart from a history of hypertension diagnosed 1 year ago, the patient
denies any past medical history. He is not taking any antihypertensive medications. The patient denies
smoking, or alcohol or drug use. Family history is unremarkable. His blood pressure (BP) is 230/130
mmHg with otherwise normal vital signs and no other significant findings. ECG shows diffuse T-wave
inversion and ST depression in lateral leads. Laboratory testing is significant for elevated troponin,
signaling myocardial infarction.
Case history #2
A 35-year-old woman presents at 37 weeks' gestation with severe headache and acute abdominal pain.
She had a routine prenatal visit 4 days previously with no signs or symptoms reported or observed. On
exam, her BP is 165/110 mmHg and urinalysis reveals proteinuria (3+). She is admitted to hospital and is
started on labetalol.
Other presentations
In addition to acute coronary syndrome or severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, hypertensive emergency can
present as new or progressive damage to the following target organs: brain (e.g., stroke, seizure, transient
ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, intracerebral or subarachnoid bleed, hypertensive encephalopathy,
posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy); heart/blood vessels (acute pulmonary edema, acute
congestive heart failure, acute aortic dissection, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia); kidney (acute
kidney injury); retina (papilledema, hemorrhages, retinal edema).

Hypertensive emergencies Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
The key to diagnosis of hypertensive emergency is a rapid but thorough evaluation. The main areas of focus
should be the neurologic, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Emergency treatment should be initiated while
conducting a full diagnostic appraisal.
History
Any prior history of hypertension and previous treatment (including treatment adherence) should be
identified.[7] [18] Prior or existing history of neurologic, cardiac, and renal impairment should also be
determined.
Clinical features that may identify specific organ compromise include:[18] [24] [40][54]
• Neurologic compromise: for example, blurry vision, dizziness, headache, seizures, change in
mental status from baseline, dysphagia, loss of sensation, paresthesia, or loss of movement
• Cardiac compromise: for example, chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, or edema
• Renal compromise: for example, decrease in urine output.
When appropriate, use of street drugs, particularly sympathomimetics (cocaine, amphetamines,
phenylpropanolamine, phencyclidine, ecstasy, LSD) should be investigated.[7] [18]
A diagnosis of preeclampsia or eclampsia should be considered in pregnant patients.[48] [55] Commonly
described features of preeclampsia headache include severe bilateral frontal headache and blurry vision,
which may progress to bilateral cortical blindness.[55] [56] The headache typically develops in temporal
relation to the onset of preeclampsia, or substantially worsens or improves in parallel with worsening or
improvement of preeclampsia.[55] In the setting of preeclampsia and headache, it is important to consider
alternative secondary etiologies (e.g., reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome, or infection) if accompanied by an altered level of consciousness, vomiting, or
fever.[55]
Physical exam
An appropriately sized cuff should be used for blood pressure (BP) readings, so that the bladder encircles
80% of the arm.[1] [57] The arm should be supported at heart level during recordings. Using too large a
cuff could result in an underestimation of BP; conversely, too small a cuff could lead to over-estimation. It
should be noted if a larger- or smaller-than-normal cuff size is used.[1]
BP readings should be taken from both arms.[7] [54] Readings should be repeated after 5 minutes to
confirm. If there is a more than 20 mmHg pressure difference between arms, aortic dissection should be
considered.[58] [59] If blood pressure is elevated, a second measurement should be taken.[60]
A fundoscopic exam should be performed, with the aid of slit lamp exam and pupillary mydriasis if
necessary, looking for the presence of arteriolar spasm, retinal edema, retinal hemorrhages, retinal
exudates, papilledema, or engorged retinal veins.[7] [18]

A rapid bedside neurologic exam is also required, including testing of cognition, cranial nerve function,
dysarthria, motor strength, gross sensory function, upper extremity pronator drift, and gait.
Cardiopulmonary status should be assessed, examining in particular for the presence of new murmurs,
friction rubs, additional heart sounds, lateral displacement of the apex beat, jugular venous distension,
carotid or renal artery bruits, rales, and lower extremity edema.
Abdominal exam should be performed. Tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant is seen in
severe preeclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.[61] [62]
 Pheochromocytoma may be associated with an abdominal mass.
Renovascular hypertension should be suspected in patients with severe hypertension who have
abdominal bruits and/or unexplained renal deterioration with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor
treatment, although the clinical presentation is variable.
During pregnancy, hypertension in a previously normotensive woman with proteinuria or evidence
of systemic involvement (e.g., renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, neurologic complications,
hematologic complications) is diagnostic of preeclampsia.[48] [61]
Preeclampsia should be considered in patients with headache who are at least 20 0/7 weeks of gestation,
or within 6 weeks postpartum, and who have blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg
diastolic.[55]
At least two measurements should be made, at least 4 hours apart.[48] The neurologic exam is typically
normal in preeclampsia.[55]
See Preeclampsia (Diagnostic approach) . 
Laboratory evaluation
Baseline blood and urine samples must be collected prior to administration of treatment. Laboratory
evaluation should include the following:[7] [18] [54]

Hypertensive emergencies Diagnosis
• Blood chemistry panel, including creatinine and electrolytes
• Complete blood count, including peripheral blood smear
• Urinalysis with microscopy.
In some circumstances, the following may also be indicated:
• Liver function tests, if preeclampsia or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets)
syndrome are suspected.[48] [61]
• Cardiac enzymes and/or brain natriuretic peptide, if acute coronary syndrome or acute heart failure
is suspected.[18]
• Coagulation profile, if disseminated intravascular coagulation is suspected.[18]
• Urine or serum pregnancy test (in women of childbearing age not known to be pregnant).[18]
• A urine drug screen, if illicit drug use is suspected.[63]
• Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, if primary aldosteronism is suspected (e.g., in patients
with diastolic hypertension with persistent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis).
• Spot urine or plasma-free metanephrine levels, if pheochromocytoma is suspected (e.g., in patients
with hypertension and palpitations, headaches, and/or diaphoresis, although clinical presentation is
very variable).[18] [63] These tests need to be interpreted carefully, with consideration for possible
confounding factors such as drugs (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, clozapine, phenoxybenzamine,
beta-blockers, sympathomimetics, buspirone), or major physiologic stress.
• Do not use plasma catecholamines to rule out pheochromocytoma.[64] [65]
• Thyroid function tests, if signs of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.
• 24-hour urinary free cortisol, if Cushing syndrome is suspected.
• Sleep study, in cases of resistant hypertension and for patients with signs or symptoms of
obstructive sleep apnea.[34]
Further investigation
ECG and chest x-ray should be strongly considered.[7] [54] If aortic dissection is considered possible,
urgent thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan with contrast is recommended.[66]
[67] For patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast, computed tomography (CT) without contrast
is an acceptable alternative. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) may be used in the emergency
department, intensive care unit (ICU), or operating room for acute proximal dissections if the patient
is clinically unstable and there is any question about the diagnosis, or if CTA is unavailable or
contraindicated.[66] [67] See Aortic dissection .
In clinical situations with high suspicion for renal artery disease, the use of doppler ultrasound, usually
recommended as first-line imaging. This may be followed by magnetic resonance angiography and/
or CTA.[68] Due to the potential risks with invasive procedures, angiography is generally limited to
visualization and quantification of the stenosis before vascular intervention.[68]
If ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage is suspected (e.g., in patients with decreased consciousness
or those with focal neurological deficits), an urgent noncontrast CT scan of the head and/or a magnetic
resonance imaging scan should be requested, depending on local availability.[18] Typically patients
initially undergo a noncontrast head CT, in order to exclude a brain hemorrhage and guide treatment.[69]
 The mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery findings on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful for selecting those who may benefit from intravenous
thrombolysis.[69] However, MRI may take more than 30 minutes to complete, and is not universally
available. See Ischemic stroke  and Hemorrhagic stroke .

Hypertensive emergencies Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends evaluating headaches in
pregnancy that warrant brain or vascular imaging with magnetic resonance techniques that limit the use of
gadolinium.[55]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
blood pressure (BP) >180/120 mmHg (common)
• BP is usually >180/120 mmHg in hypertensive emergencies; however, the key determinant is the
presence of new or worsening end-organ damage.[1] [60] During pregnancy, hypertension in a
previously normotensive woman with proteinuria or evidence of systemic involvement (e.g., renal
insufficiency, impaired liver function, neurologic complications, hematologic complications) is
diagnostic of preeclampsia.[48] [61] Preeclampsia should be considered in patients with headache
who are at least 20 0/7 weeks of gestation, or within 6 weeks postpartum, and who have blood
pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic.[55] At least two measurements should be made,
at least 4 hours apart.[48]
Other diagnostic factors
neurologic symptoms (common)
• Neurologic abnormalities, such as vision changes, dizziness, headache, dysarthria, seizures, change
in mental status, dysphagia, loss of sensation or paresthesia, and loss of movement, are symptoms
often associated with hypertensive emergency.[40] Commonly described features of preeclampsia
headache include severe bilateral frontal headache and blurry vision, which may progress to bilateral
cortical blindness.[55] [56] The headache typically develops in temporal relation to the onset of
preeclampsia, or substantially worsens or improves in parallel with worsening or improvement of
preeclampsia.[55]
cardiac symptoms (common)
• Cardiac abnormalities (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, palpitations, edema) are frequently associated with hypertensive emergency.[40]
abnormal cardiopulmonary exam (common)
• The presence of new murmurs, friction rub, S3, jugular venous distension, rales, or lower extremity
edema may be found.
abnormal abdominal exam (common)
• Tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant is seen in severe preeclampsia and HELLP
(hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.[61] [62] Pheochromocytoma may be
associated with an abdominal mass. Renovascular hypertension should be suspected in patients
with severe hypertension who have abdominal bruits and/or unexplained renal deterioration with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, although the clinical presentation is variable.

Hypertensive emergencies Diagnosis
oliguria or polyuria (common)
• Any changes in renal output can be indicative of renal damage.[24]
abnormal fundoscopic exam (common)
• The following signs are indicative of hypertensive retinopathy: arteriolar spasm, retinal edema, retinal
hemorrhages, retinal exudates, papilledema, engorged retinal veins.[7][71]
abnormal neurologic exam (common)
• Abnormal findings in cognition, cranial nerve function, motor strength, gross sensory function, and gait
can frequently result from hypertensive crisis.
Risk factors
Strong
inadequately treated hypertension
• A history of inadequately treated hypertension is commonly seen.[18] [21] [22] [23]
chronic kidney disease
• Chronic kidney disease is a strong risk factor for hypertension and progression to hypertensive
emergencies in both adults and children.[13] [18][24] [25] [26] [27]
renal artery stenosis
• Renal artery stenosis is strongly associated with secondary hypertension.[28]
renal transplant
• Renal transplantation is commonly associated with hypertension, with graft failure most commonly
responsible.[29] Transplant renal artery stenosis accounts for between 1% and 5% of hypertension
after transplantation.[30] Anti-rejection medication (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) may also play a role.[7]
[31] [39]
endocrine disorders with known hypertensive effects
• There are a number of endocrine disorders that are associated with hypertensive emergencies. These
include: primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, thyroid disorder, Cushing syndrome, acromegaly,
hyperparathyroidism, carcinoid tumor, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or renin-secreting tumor.[31]
[35] [36][37] The treatment of certain endocrine disorders may also precipitate a hypertensive
emergency. For example, the use of beta-blocker medication before the administration of an alpha-
adrenergic receptor blocker in a patient with a pheochromocytoma may lead to a hypertensive
crisis.[46][47]
pregnancy
• Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome
can all result in a hypertensive emergency.[31] [48]

older age
• Older age predisposes to hypertensive emergency.[10] [11] [12] [13]
black ethnicity
• Black people are predisposed to hypertensive emergency, compared with white people.[11] [12]
male sex
• Men may be more likely than women to suffer a hypertensive emergency.[11] [12]
use of sympathomimetic drugs
• Use of sympathomimetic street drugs (e.g., cocaine, LSD, amphetamines, ecstasy) predisposes to
hypertensive emergency.[7][18]
pharmacotherapy with known hypertensive effect
• Many medications can induce or exacerbate hypertension, leading to a hypertensive emergency.
These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, sympathomimetics, illicit
drugs, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, erythropoietin, herbal supplements,
vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, and inadvertent drug or food interactions with monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).[7][31] [39] If foods high in tyramine are ingested by patients taking MAOIs,
this can precipitate a hypertensive emergency (the so called ‘tyramine reaction’).
obstructive sleep apnea
• Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with secondary hypertension which, if left untreated, may
precipitate a hypertensive emergency.[32] [33] [34]
vasculitis and connective tissue diseases
• Multiple vasculitides and connective tissue disorders are associated with hypertension and
hypertensive emergencies. These include scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu's
arteritis, and giant cell arteritis.[31] [49] [50] [51]

• Acute kidney injury may be the only sign of hypertensive emergency.
may reveal elevated
creatinine and BUN
CBC with smear
• Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia may occur in patients with
hypertensive emergency and increases the risk of developing acute
kidney injury.[72] Additional evidence for hemolysis may be obtained
by checking a serum LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin.

ECG
• If the patient has chest pain and there is ST elevation on the ECG,
the patient should be sent for emergency revascularization.
• If the ECG is abnormal but the ST segment is not elevated,
biomarkers (high-sensitivity troponin), and echocardiogram are the
first-line investigations in all patients to rule out ongoing ischemia or
infarction.
• If the ECG is normal, aortic dissection should be considered in the
context of unexplained chest pain.
may reveal evidence of
ischemia or infarct such
as ST- or T-wave changes
chest x-ray
• A chest x-ray is useful to assess for pulmonary edema, left ventricular
hypertrophy, and aortic dissection.
• A plain chest x-ray is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for
aortic dissection to be used as a diagnostic tool. If aortic dissection
is suspected, urgent computed tomography angiography (CTA) with
contrast should be ordered.

Recommendations Rationale
plasma catecholamines
• Do not use plasma catecholamines to rule out pheochromocytoma
as a cause of hypertension. Use urine or plasma metanephrine
instead.[64] [65]
• Measurement of
metabolites including
metanephrine
provides a

thrombolysis.[69] However, MRI may take more than 30 minutes to
complete, and is not universally available. The American College of

Hypertensive emergencies Management
Approach
If hypertensive emergency is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while conducting a full diagnostic
evaluation.
Appropriate facilities
Patients with hypertensive emergencies should be admitted to an intensive care unit for continuous
monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and target organ damage and for parenteral administration of
appropriate therapeutic agent(s).[1] [7][18] [74] Other supportive measures that may be required include
intracranial pressure monitoring (in rare cases of increased intracranial pressure), noninvasive ventilation
or intubation (in cases of respiratory distress), or dialysis (in case of severe acute kidney injury).
Choice of agents and route of administration
The specific parenteral agents used for treating a hypertensive emergency should be dictated by the
end-organ systems that have been damaged, patient comorbidities, and overall clinical condition. Oral
therapies are generally discouraged as first-line treatment options.[1] Arterial lines are preferred for the
use of intravenous antihypertensive medications.[7] There are very few randomized controlled trials
studying different parenteral agents in hypertensive emergency. Published guidelines are therefore based
on common clinical experience and practice.
Rate of BP reduction
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure states that the initial goal of therapy in hypertensive
emergencies is to reduce mean arterial BP by no more than 25% (within minutes to 1 hour), then, if
stable, to 160 mmHg systolic and 100-110 mmHg diastolic within the next 2-6 hours.[1]
Excessive falls in pressure that may precipitate renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia should be
avoided.[1] [57]
If the initial level of reduced BP is well tolerated and the patient is clinically stable, further gradual
reductions toward a normal BP can be implemented over the next 24-48 hours.
Exceptions to the above recommendation include:[1] [75]
• Patients with an ischemic stroke, as there is no clear evidence from clinical trials to support the use
of immediate antihypertensive treatment
• Patients who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy (typically those with ischemic stroke), who
should have their BP slowly lowered to systolic BP (SBP) <185 mmHg and diastolic BP <110
mmHg before intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is initiated
• Patients with severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, or pheochromocytoma crisis, in whom SBP should
be reduced to <140 mmHg in the first hour
• Patients with aortic dissection, in whom accepted practice is reduction of SBP to <120 mmHg in the
first 20 minutes, although evidence to support this timescale is lacking.

Hypertensive emergencies Management
MANAGEMENT
Accelerated (malignant) hypertension, hypertensive
encephalopathy or intracranial hemorrhage
The term "accelerated hypertension" (also known as malignant hypertension) is a subcategory of
hypertensive emergency where severe hypertension occurs with retinopathy of grade III (flame
hemorrhages, dot and blot hemorrhages, hard and soft exudates) or grade IV (papilledema).[18] [54]
Hypertensive encephalopathy encompasses the transient neurologic symptoms (lethargy, seizures,
cortical blindness, and coma) that occur with malignant hypertension, which are usually reversed by
prompt treatment and lowering of BP.[18] [54] Encephalopathy should improve once the BP is lowered. If
there is no improvement despite a decrease in BP, an alternative diagnosis should be considered.
In the management of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the patient's ideal BP should be based on
individual factors, including baseline BP, presumed cause of hemorrhage, age, elevated intracranial
pressure, and interval since onset. In cases of large or severe ICH, or an initial SBP ≥220 mmHg,
cautious BP lowering should be pursued.[76] In patients with initial SBP ≥220 mmHg, early intensive BP
reduction, compared with standard BP lowering, was associated with higher rates of renal adverse events
in one post-hoc analysis of a large randomized clinical trial.[76] [77]
While elevated BP could in theory increase the risk of ongoing bleeding from ruptured small arteries and
arterioles, the relationship between BP, intracranial pressure, and volume of hemorrhage is complex and
not yet fully understood.
The rationale for lowering BP is to minimize further hemorrhage: for example, from a ruptured aneurysm
or arteriovenous malformation. However, the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of rapid BP
lowering in the management of intracerebral hemorrhage remains inconclusive.[76] [78][79] [80]
For the management of patients with spontaneous ICH, recommendations from the American Heart
Association and American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) include the following, based on two of the
largest trials for early intensive BP lowering after ICH (INTERACT2, ATACH-2), meta-analyses, and
several post-hoc analyses of these two trials:[76] [78] [79]
• In patients with spontaneous ICH requiring acute BP lowering, careful titration to ensure continuous
smooth and sustained control of BP, avoiding peaks and large variability in SBP, can be beneficial
for improving functional outcomes.
• Initiating blood pressure treatment within 2 hours of ICH onset, and reaching target within 1 hour,
can be beneficial to reduce the risk of hematoma expansion and improve functional outcomes.
• In patients with spontaneous ICH of mild to moderate severity presenting with SBP between 150
and 220 mmHg, acute lowering of SBP to a target of 140 mmHg, with the goal of maintaining
it within the range of 130-150 mmHg, is safe and may be reasonable for improving functional
outcomes. Acute lowering of SBP to <130 mmHg is potentially harmful in these patients.
• In patients with spontaneous ICH presenting with large or severe ICH, SBP >220 mmHg, more than
6 hours after symptom onset, or in those requiring surgical decompression, the safety and efficacy
of intensive BP lowering is not well established.
See Hemorrhagic stroke (Management approach) .
Treatment options include the following.

Hypertensive emergencies Management
• Labetalol is the first-line treatment for accelerated (malignant) hypertension, hypertensive
encephalopathy, or intracranial hemorrhage.[18] [39] [41] [42]
• Second-line
• Nicardipine is a second-line agent.[18] One randomized controlled trial found that
intravenous nicardipine significantly increased the proportion of people who reached
physician-specified target range SBP within 30 minutes compared with intravenous
labetalol.[81] Nicardipine is especially useful in the presence of cardiac disease due to
coronary vasodilatory effects.[82] [83]
• If patients do not have evidence of raised intracranial pressure, nitroprusside is a second-line
treatment choice.[39] [41] However, if raised intracranial pressure is present or suspected,
nitroprusside is contraindicated and another agent should be used.[18] [84] Nitroprusside
decreases cerebral blood flow while increasing intracranial pressure, effects that are
particularly disadvantageous in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy or following a
stroke.[85] [86] [87] It should also be avoided in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency.
• Third-line
• The third-line treatment choice is fenoldopam, a selective peripheral dopamine-1-receptor
agonist with arterial vasodilator effects.[39] [41] [42] [88] [89] This drug is particularly useful
in patients with renal insufficiency, where the use of nitroprusside is restricted due to the risk
of thiocyanate poisoning.
Acute ischemic stroke
Treating a hypertensive emergency with an associated acute ischemic stroke warrants greater caution
in reducing BP than in other types of hypertensive emergency. Overly rapid or large reductions of mean
arterial pressure may decrease cerebral perfusion pressure to a level that could theoretically worsen
brain injury. However, AHA/ASA guidelines recommend early treatment of hypertension when required by
comorbid conditions, including preeclampsia/eclampsia.[69] The following may be used as guidance.
If the SBP is >220 mmHg or the diastolic BP is >120 mmHg, it may be reasonable to lower the BP by 15%
during the first 24 hours after the onset of stroke.[1] [90]
If the SBP is <220 mmHg and the diastolic BP is <120 mmHg, then it is reasonable to maintain close
observation without direct intervention to reduce BP, unless:[1] [91] [92]
• There is other end-organ involvement such as aortic dissection, renal failure, or acute myocardial
infarction
• The patient is to receive thrombolysis, in which case the target SBP should be <185 mmHg and
diastolic BP <110 mmHg. The BP should be maintained <185/105 mmHg for at least 24 hours after
initiating intravenous thrombolysis.
If the SBP is >220 mmHg or diastolic BP is between 121-140 mmHg, then labetalol, nicardipine, or
clevidipine should be used to achieve a 10% to 15% reduction in BP in 24 hours.[39] [41] [42] [93] [94]
If diastolic BP is >140 mmHg, then nitroprusside is used to achieve a 10% to 15% reduction over 24
hours.[39] [41] [95]

Hypertensive emergencies Management
MANAGEMENT
Myocardial ischemia/infarction
First-line treatment of hypertensive emergency complicated by myocardial ischemia or infarction is the
combination of esmolol (a selective beta-blocker) plus nitroglycerin (a peripheral vasodilator, which affects
venous vessels more than arterial).[1] [39] [41] [42] [95] [96]
Esmolol acts to reduce the heart rate and nitroglycerin acts to decrease preload and cardiac output, and
increases coronary blood flow.
Second-line treatment choice would be labetalol plus nitroglycerin.[39] [41] [42] [95] [96]
Contraindications to beta-blockers include moderate-to-severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary
edema, bradycardia, hypotension, poor peripheral perfusion, second- or third-degree heart block, and
reactive airway disease.[1]
The third-line treatment choice would be nitroprusside.[39] [41] [95]
Left ventricular failure and/or pulmonary edema
First-line treatment of hypertensive emergency with left ventricular failure and/or pulmonary edema is
nitroglycerin or clevidipine.[39] [41] [42] [96]
Nitroprusside (a potent arterial and venous vasodilator that decreases after-load and preload) is the
second-line treatment choice in this situation.[39] [41] [95]
If the patient is not already on a loop diuretic, one should be started (e.g., furosemide). Beta-blockers are
contraindicated in moderate-to-severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema.[1]
Suspected aortic dissection
If aortic dissection is suspected in a hypertensive emergency, the BP should be lowered quite
aggressively, typically with a target of reducing the SBP to <120 mmHg within 20 minutes, although
evidence to support this timescale is lacking.[1] [75]
Medical therapy aims to both lower the BP and decrease the velocity of left ventricular contraction, so
decreasing aortic shear stress and minimizing the tendency for propagation of the dissection.
First-line treatment choice is beta-blockers, either labetalol or esmolol, administered intravenously.[39]
[41] [42] [97]
If there is no significant improvement, nitroprusside or nicardipine can be added to the beta-blocker.[39]
[41] [42] [97] The beta-blockade should precede vasodilator (nicardipine or nitroprusside) administration
to prevent reflex tachycardia and worsen shear stress on the intimal flap.[1] See Aortic dissection .
Acute kidney injury
Fenoldopam is the first-line treatment choice of hypertensive emergency complicated by acute kidney
injury.[39] [41] [42] [88] [89] This drug (a selective peripheral dopamine-1-receptor agonist with arterial
vasodilator effects) is particularly useful in renal insufficiency because it acts to both decrease afterload
and increase renal perfusion. Other potential first-line agents are dihydropyridine calcium-channel
blockers (e.g., nicardipine, clevidipine), which increase stroke volume and have strong cerebral and
coronary vasodilatory activity.[1] [39] [41] [42] [93]

Hypertensive emergencies Management
Hyperadrenergic states
Hyperadrenergic states include:
• Pheochromocytoma
• Sympathomimetic drug use: for example, cocaine, amphetamines, phenylpropanolamine,
phencyclidine, or the combination of monoamine oxidase inhibitors with foods rich in tyramine
• Following abrupt discontinuation of a short-acting sympathetic blocker.
If the hyperadrenergic state is due to sympathomimetic drug use, the first-line agents are
benzodiazepines, and antihypertensive medications are given only if the BP response is inadequate.[18]
[54] Benzodiazepines reduce agitation and prevent neurologic complications such as seizures by their
action on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors.[18] In all other clinical situations, the first-line treatment
choice is phentolamine (which acts by blocking alpha-adrenoceptors) or calcium-channel blockers
(clevidipine and nicardipine).[1] [39] [41] [42] A beta-blocker (such as labetalol) can be added after
sufficient alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. The administration of a beta-blocker alone is contraindicated,
since inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor-induced vasodilation results in unopposed alpha-adrenergic
vasoconstriction and a further rise in BP.[54]
Severe hypertension in pregnancy (preeclampsia and eclampsia)
For acute-onset, severe hypertension managed in a critical care setting, intravenous labetalol, intravenous
hydralazine, or oral nifedipine can be used first line. Labetalol is usually considered the antihypertensive
of choice, and is effective as monotherapy in 80% of pregnant women.[48] [61][98] [99] It seems to be
safe and effective in pregnant women for the management of preeclampsia; however, it should be avoided
in women with asthma or any other contraindication to its use.[48] Immediate-release oral nifedipine may
also be considered first-line therapy, particularly when intravenous access is not available.[48] Although
intravenous hydralazine is still widely used, particularly in North America, it can produce an acute fall in
BP.[63] The consequences of this are mostly related to maternal hypotension, including a greater risk
of cesarean section, more frequent placental abruption, more maternal oliguria, and fetal tachycardia,
suggesting the need for close monitoring of maternal BP and fetal wellbeing during its use.[63] The UK
guidelines recommend to consider volume expansion with crystalloid fluid before or at the same time as
the first dose of intravenous hydralazine in the prenatal period.[61]
If second-line alternatives are required, the choice of agent should be discussed with an appropriate
subspecialist in fetal-maternal medicine or critical care. Availability of drugs and local experience with
individual drugs are likely to influence the choice of treatment.[54]
In pregnancy, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are avoided due to potential
teratogenic effects, and nitroprusside is avoided due to its potential for fetal cyanide poisoning.[1] Renin
inhibitors are also contraindicated.[1]
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends antihypertensive
therapy for women with preeclampsia and a sustained SBP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg.[48]
 However, thresholds for treatment vary internationally, with lower thresholds recommended by a number
of societies.[100] The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends treatment if BP
remains above 140/90 mmHg.[61]
Although some of the available literature suggests that antihypertensive agents should be administered
within 30-60 minutes, it is recommended that antihypertensive therapy begin as soon as reasonably
possible after the criteria for acute onset severe hypertension are met.[48] It should be noted, however,

In patients with initial SBP ≥220 mmHg, early
intensive BP reduction, compared with standard
BP lowering, was associated with higher rates of
renal adverse events in one post-hoc analysis of
a large randomized clinical trial.[76] [77]
» For the management of patients
with spontaneous ICH, the American
Heart Association and American Stroke
Association (AHA/ASA) recommend careful

to ensure continuous smooth and sustained
control of BP, avoiding peaks and large variability
in SBP. This can be beneficial for improving
functional outcomes.[76] Initiating treatment
within 2 hours of ICH onset, and reaching target
within 1 hour, can be beneficial to reduce the risk
of hematoma expansion and improve functional
outcome.[76] In patients with spontaneous
ICH of mild to moderate severity presenting
with SBP between 150 and 220 mmHg, acute
lowering of SBP to a target of 140 mmHg, with

SBP ≤220 mmHg and DBP
≤120 mmHg
1st close observation ± blood pressure
reduction
» Treatment of hypertension with an associated
acute ischemic stroke warrants greater caution
in reducing blood pressure (BP) than with other
types of hypertensive emergency. Overly rapid or
too great a reduction of mean arterial pressure
may decrease cerebral perfusion pressure to a
level that could theoretically worsen brain injury
(e.g., through watershed infarcts). However,
American Heart Association/American Stroke
Association guidelines recommend early
treatment of hypertension when required by
comorbid conditions, including preeclampsia/
eclampsia.[69]
» If the systolic BP (SBP) is below 220 mmHg
and the diastolic BP is below 120 mmHg,
there is no evidence of end organ involvement
or intracranial hemorrhage and thrombolytic
treatment is not proposed, then it is reasonable
to maintain close observation without direct
intervention to reduce BP.
» If there is other end-organ involvement such
as aortic dissection, acute kidney injury, or
acute myocardial infarction, or the patient is to
receive thrombolysis, the target SBP should be
below 185 mmHg and diastolic BP should be
below 110 mmHg. The BP should be maintained
below 185/105 mmHg for at least 24 hours after
initiating intravenous thrombolysis.
» The choice of agent to reduce BP depends on
the associated end-organ involvement.

should be admitted to an intensive care unit

and target organ damage and for parenteral

» The American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends
antihypertensive therapy for women with
preeclampsia and a sustained systolic BP ≥160
mmHg or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg.[48] However,
thresholds for treatment vary internationally,
with lower thresholds recommended by a
number of societies.[100] The UK National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence
recommends treatment if BP remains above
140/90 mmHg.[61]
» Although some of the available literature
suggests that antihypertensive agents should
be administered within 30-60 minutes, it is
recommended that antihypertensive therapy
begin as soon as reasonably possible after the
criteria for acute onset severe hypertension
are met.[48] It should be noted, however, that
there are no trials supporting these suggested
thresholds, and treatments should be tailored
to individual patient circumstances. Specialist
advice should be sought.
» For acute-onset, severe hypertension
managed in a critical care setting, intravenous
labetalol, intravenous hydralazine, or oral
nifedipine can be used first line.
» Labetalol is usually considered the
antihypertensive of choice, and is effective as
monotherapy in 80% of pregnant women.[48]
[61][98][99] It seems to be safe and effective
in pregnant women for the management of
preeclampsia; however, it should be avoided in
women with asthma or any other contraindication
to its use.[48]

MANAGEMENT
Acute
» Labetalol acts as an alpha-1-blocker and
nonselective beta-blocker and its hemodynamic
effects include decreasing systemic vascular
resistance, mean arterial pressure, and heart
rate, accompanied by a slight decrease or
minimal change in cardiac output. Onset of
action: 5-10 minutes. Duration of action: 3-8
hours.
» Hydralazine is an arterial vasodilator with
minimal effects on the fetus. Onset of action:
10-20 minutes. Duration of action: 3-8 hours.
Its main hemodynamic effects are a decrease
in systemic vascular resistance, an increase
in heart rate, and an increase in intracranial
pressure. Although intravenous hydralazine
is still widely used, particularly in North
America, it can produce an acute fall in BP.
The consequences of this are mostly related to
maternal hypotension, including a greater risk
of cesarean section, more frequent placental
abruption, more maternal oliguria, and fetal
tachycardia, suggesting the need for close
monitoring of maternal BP and fetal wellbeing
during its use.[63] UK guidelines recommend
to consider volume expansion with crystalloid
fluid before or at the same time as the first
dose of intravenous hydralazine in the prenatal
period.[61]
» Immediate-release oral nifedipine may also
be considered first-line therapy, particularly
when intravenous access is not available.[48]
 Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel
blocker, which increases stroke volume and
has strong cerebral and coronary vasodilatory
activity. Onset of action: 30-45 minutes. Duration
of action: 4-6 hours.
» Therapy should be continued until the fetus
has been delivered and the patient is stable on
oral therapy.
» Patients with hypertensive emergencies
should be admitted to an intensive care
unit for continuous monitoring of blood
pressure and target organ damage and for
parenteral administration of appropriate
therapeutic agent(s).[1] [74] See Preeclampsia
(Management approach) .
Primary prevention
The mainstay of primary prevention is appropriate screening and treatment of essential hypertension.

Hypertensive emergencies Management
In the US, around 25% of all hypertensive individuals are unaware of their illness, 35% are not being treated,
and 52% of those being treated are not at goal blood pressure levels.[52] [53] See Essential hypertension
(Prevention) .
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia
prophylaxis. This should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16
weeks of gestation) and continued until delivery.[48]
• Any of the high-risk factors for preeclampsia: previous pregnancy with preeclampsia, multifetal
gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic
hypertension.
• More than one of the moderate-risk factors: first pregnancy, maternal age ≥35 years, body mass index
>30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors.
See Preeclampsia (Prevention) .
Secondary prevention
Major lifestyle modifications shown to lower blood pressure include the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, dietary sodium reduction, weight reduction in overweight patients, physical
activity, and moderation of alcohol consumption.[38] [103] For women with severe preeclampsia, low-dose
aspirin (starting at 12-14 weeks' gestation) is recommended in subsequent pregnancies. See Preeclampsia
(Prevention) .
Patient discussions
Patients should be reminded of the importance of taking medications as directed and not missing doses.
Patients should be advised to call their doctor or an ambulance immediately if they experience any
dizziness, loss of sensation or mobility, blurred vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other
relevant symptoms.

Hypertensive emergencies Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
The patient should return for a follow-up visit and blood pressure (BP) check within 1 week of discharge.
During the follow-up visit, BP should be checked by a medical professional in both arms and with the
appropriate cuff size. The target BP should be below 130/80 mmHg. Regular and frequent follow-up
(monthly) is recommended until target BP and ideally regression of hypertension-mediated organ damage
has been achieved.[54] Patients should return for follow-up visits once a month, or more frequently,
until the target BP is achieved. Once the target BP is achieved, the patient should be monitored every
3 to 6 months (or more frequently based on comorbidities). Serum potassium and creatinine should be
measured twice a year. For patients with preeclampsia, see Pre-eclampsia (Monitoring) .
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
cardiac impairment variable high
Myocardial damage and subsequent heart failure is a frequent complication and cause of death in
hypertensive emergency.[101] [102]
neurologic deficit variable medium
Permanent neurologic compromise may occur after stroke, hemorrhage, or hypertensive encephalopathy
and is a frequent cause of death.[101] [102]
acute kidney injury variable medium
Acute kidney injury is both a frequent cause and complication of hypertensive emergency.[101] [102]
Prognosis
Without therapy, the prognosis of hypertensive emergencies is poor with 1-year survival rates of 10% to
20%.[1] However, current antihypertensive therapy has greatly improved survival, with 5-year survival
rates around 70% in patients who receive appropriate treatment. The presence of acute kidney injury upon
diagnosis of hypertensive emergency increases the mortality rate.[101] [102]
Preeclampsia is a self-limiting condition of pregnancy that usually resolves once the placenta has been
delivered, although it may persist for a few days post delivery. There are few long-term sequelae; however,
there are some long-term disease associations. See Preeclampsia (Prognosis) .

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
