Renal artery stenosis Overview
Summary
Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is typically due to atherosclerotic disease or fibromuscular dysplasia.
RAS often presents with accelerated or difficult-to-control hypertension.
Worsening kidney function, especially after initiating renin-angiotensin blockade, and recurrent flash
pulmonary edema are common features.
Presence of renal artery narrowing does not necessarily indicate clinical consequences. Renal artery
stenosis, renovascular hypertension, and ischemic nephropathy are various manifestations of this process.
Definitive diagnosis is with imaging.
Management typically involves medical therapy, with revascularization reserved for selected high-risk or
severe cases.
Definition
RAS is a narrowing of the renal artery lumen. It is considered angiographically significant if more than a 50%
reduction in vessel diameter is present.[1] Ischemic nephropathy is a chronic reduction in glomerular filtration
rate that occurs from a narrowing in the renal artery. Renovascular hypertension is hypertension mediated by
high levels of renin and angiotensin II, produced by an underperfused kidney supplied by a stenosed renal
artery.

THEORY
Epidemiology
RAS has a prevalence of 0.2% to 5% in all hypertensive patients.[7]
Epidemiology depends on the underlying cause:
• Atherosclerotic RAS accounts for 90% of all RAS.[1] [8] [9] Prevalence is as high as 25% in patients
with coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization.[2]
Two percent of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is due to ischemic nephropathy.[10]

• Fibromuscular dysplasia accounts for 10% of clinical RAS.[11] Females are 2 to 10 times more likely
than males to be diagnosed with this form of RAS.[2] [11] Onset typically occurs before the age of
30.[2] [11]

RAS to be idiopathic (60.5%), with middle aortic syndrome and fibromuscular dysplasia representing
the most common nonidiopathic etiologies.[12]

THEORY
• Spontaneous renal artery dissection
• Arteriovenous malformations
• Arteriovenous fistulas
• Trauma
• Abdominal radiation therapy
• Retroperitoneal fibrosis
• Other vasculitis.
Pathophysiology
In general:[1] [2] [3] [7]
• Activation of the renin-angiotensin system causes increased systemic vascular resistance and sodium
retention.
• When the stenosis exceeds 50% reduction in vessel diameter, these regulatory mechanisms may fail,
leading to worsening kidney function and difficult-to-control hypertension.
• Underperfusion of the kidney caused by blood flow obstruction produces adaptive changes in the
kidney, including atrophy of tubular cells, fibrosis of the capillary tuft, and intrarenal arterial medial
thickening.
• Angiotensin II stimulates fibroblast activity, which may lead to fibrosis in the glomerular tuft and in the
tubules.
• In addition to activation of the renin-angiotensin system, other mechanisms include activation of
the sympathetic nervous system, abnormalities in endothelial nitric oxide, endothelin release, and
increased oxidative stress.[3]
• Hypertension can cause hyalinosis, mesangial cell expansion, and growth factor release resulting in
fibrosis.
• Bilateral RAS results in volume overload with inappropriately elevated levels of renin.
Atherosclerotic RAS:[1] [2]
• Usually involves the ostial and proximal third of the renal artery.
• Endothelial injury and atherogenesis.
• Spontaneous or iatrogenic atheroemboli may further deteriorate kidney function.
Fibromuscular dysplasia:[1] [14]
• May be focal, occurring in any part of the artery, or multifocal (alternating areas of stenosis and dilation
[the so-called ‘string of beads’], which usually occurs in the mid and distal portions of the artery).
• Unknown etiology.

• Total occlusion: 100% reduction in vessel diameter
Case history
Case history #1
A 68-year-old man with known coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease presents with
recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema, worsening kidney function, and progressively difficult-to-
control hypertension. An angiogram of the aorta and renal arteries shows a sclerotic aorta with plaque
extending into the proximal third of both renal arteries.

Case history #2
A 32-year-old woman with no prior medical history is seen for worsening headache and is found to
have a BP of 180/110 mmHg. Her BP responds inadequately to thiazide diuretics and calcium-channel
blockers. A magnetic resonance angiogram of the renal arteries reveals a beaded appearance indicative
of fibromuscular dysplasia.

Other presentations
RAS due to fibromuscular dysplasia is more common in women <30 years. RAS in general often presents
as accelerated, resistant, or malignant hypertension. RAS may be associated with acute decline in
kidney function after initiation of renin-angiotensin blockade. It may be diagnosed in assessing an
unexplained atrophic kidney, or discrepancy in kidney size >1.5 cm, or sudden, unexplained, and/or
recurrent pulmonary edema.

Renal artery stenosis Diagnosis
Approach
The evaluation of RAS includes consideration of factors in the patient's history and decisions on the
appropriate imaging modalities.
History
Age of onset of hypertension may be suggestive of the underlying etiology of RAS:
• <30 years suggests fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).[7] [16]
• >55 years suggests atherosclerotic RAS.[7] [16]
Sudden or unexplained recurrent pulmonary edema is suggestive of RAS:[7] [16] [17] [18]
• In patients with atherosclerosis, RAS may induce an acute or subacute acceleration of a preexisting
essential hypertension that may precipitate flash pulmonary edema.
Hypertension (accelerated, malignant, or resistant)
• Patients with either atherosclerotic or FMD form of RAS can present with severe, progressive, and/
or difficult-to-control hypertension, sometimes causing end-organ damage.[7] [16] [19]
Kidney dysfunction or acute kidney injury:
• Unexplained kidney dysfunction may result from progressive stenosis or hypertension-related end-
organ damage.[2] [7]
• Acute kidney injury can be seen in some patients with bilateral RAS or RAS of a single functioning
kidney after starting an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist.[2] [7] [19]
Clinical factors predisposing to atherosclerotic RAS include:[2] [19]
• Multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD)
• Other peripheral vascular disease (PVD)
• Unexplained congestive heart failure (CHF)
• Refractory angina
• Dyslipidemia
• Smoking (implicated in etiology of both atherosclerotic and FMD types of RAS)[1] [14]
• Absence of family history of hypertension - may be suggestive of RAS as a cause of
hypertension.[2] [13]
Examination
Given that RAS can only conclusively be diagnosed with imaging, suggestive findings on examination
include:
• Hypertension on BP measurement
• Abdominal bruit: the finding of an abdominal bruit should raise the suspicion for the presence of
RAS[2] [7]
• Other bruits: bruits in other vessels are frequent due to the common pathophysiology and high
prevalence of coexistent PVD.[13]
General investigations
• Serum creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate.[1]

Renal artery stenosis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Serum potassium: hypokalemia or low-to-normal potassium may suggest activation of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system.[7]
• Urinalysis and sediment evaluation (to exclude glomerular disease): RAS, in the absence of
coexistent diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis, is typically nonproteinuric without
abnormalities in the urinary sediment.[4] [20]
Evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension as indicated should be excluded and considered
in the differential diagnosis: for example, aldosterone to renin ratio (ratio <20 excludes primary
hyperaldosteronism).[7]
Choice of imaging
In addition to basic laboratory data, controversy remains as to what imaging modality is most appropriate.
While ultrasonography offers a safe, noninvasive assessment, its sensitivity and specificity are lower
than other modalities, and its use provides only indirect evidence of the presence of stenosis. Other
noninvasive techniques (i.e., CT angiography or MR angiography) have a risk associated with the use of
contrast media (radiocontrast nephropathy and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, respectively). Conventional
angiography, despite its procedural risk (e.g., atheroemboli, bleeding) and the risk of radiocontrast
nephropathy, has the advantage of being able to determine the clinical significance of the lesions by
measurement of the pressure gradient across a stenotic lesion, and the possibility of concurrently
performing endovascular therapy. Alternative imaging modalities that experts might consider in patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) include noncontrast magnetic resonance angiography[21] [22] [23] and
invasive angiography with carbon dioxide (CO2).[24] [25] [26]
It is recommended to start with a noninvasive imaging test in patients with a high clinical probability of
RAS.
A patient's risk is determined by the clinician's index of suspicion, based on the patient's demographics
(onset of hypertension at age <30 years or >55 years), comorbid conditions (PVD, CAD, CVA), and
clinical condition (hypertension refractory to >3 antihypertensive agents).
If the results of noninvasive tests are inconclusive and the clinical suspicion for RAS is high, invasive
testing is recommended.

Noninvasive imaging
It is reasonable to begin with a renal duplex ultrasound, followed if necessary by CT angiography, MR
angiography, or a captopril renal scan. Noncontrast MR angiography sequences can be considered in
patients with CKD.[21] [22] [23]
• Duplex ultrasound (sensitivity 84% to 98%, specificity 62% to 99%). Can identify discrepancy in
kidney size and velocity of renal blood flow.[4] [16] [20] Ultrasound diagnostic criteria for significant
renal artery stenosis are:[27]
• Renal artery to aorta peak systolic velocity ratio (renal-aortic ratio) >3.5
• Peak systolic velocity >200 cm/sec with evidence of poststenotic turbulence
• End-diastolic velocity >150 cm/sec (>80% renal artery stenosis) when present with a peak
systolic velocity of >200 cm/sec
• Renal resistive index >0.8 was used as a criterion historically, but as resistive index is now
known to be influenced by extrarenal factors such as systemic hemodynamics, it is no longer
routinely used in the diagnosis of RAS.[28] [29]
• Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (sensitivity 90% to 100%, specificity 76%
to 94%).[2] [4] [16] [20] Noncontrast MR angiography sequences can be considered in patients with
CKD.[21] [22] [23]
• CT angiography (sensitivity 59% to 96%, specificity 82% to 99%).[2] [4] [20] [30]
• Captopril renal scan (sensitivity 45% to 94%, specificity 81% to 100%) has a less relevant
contemporary role because of its complexity, poor sensitivity, and the availability of easier and
more accurate tests.[2] [4] [20] The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart
Association and the European Society of Cardiology/European Stroke Association/European
Society of Vascular Surgery do not recommend captopril renal scan for diagnosing RAS.[16] [17]

Invasive testing
Conventional angiography:[2] [4] [20]
• The most sensitive and specific test for assessing anatomic narrowing of the renal artery.
• Also allows for therapeutic intervention at the same time.
• Requires arterial catheterization and contrast utilization.
Additional diagnostic modalities may be used during invasive angiography (such as the evaluation of
pressure gradients, the use of pressure wires to evaluate lesion physiology, or intravascular ultrasound).
Likewise, carbon dioxide angiography may be performed in specialized centers in patients with CKD.[24]
[25] [26]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
onset of hypertension age >55 years (common)
• Suggestive of atherosclerotic RAS.[7] [16]
history of accelerated, malignant, or resistant hypertension (common)
• Patients with RAS can present with severe, progressive, and/or difficult-to-control hypertension,
sometimes causing end-organ damage.[7] [16]
history of unexplained kidney dysfunction (common)
• Due to progressive stenosis or hypertension-related end-organ damage.[7] [16]
history of multivessel coronary artery disease (common)
• Favors atherosclerotic RAS.[16] [19]
history of other peripheral vascular disease (common)
• Favors atherosclerotic RAS.[2] [19]
abdominal bruit (common)
• The finding of an abdominal bruit should raise the suspicion of the presence of RAS.[2] [7]
sudden or unexplained recurrent pulmonary edema (common)
• Suggestive of RAS.[7] [16]
onset of hypertension age <30 years (uncommon)
• Suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia.[7] [16]
Other diagnostic factors
absence of family history of hypertension (common)
• Suggestive of RAS.[2] [13]

other bruits (common)
• Bruits in other vessels are frequent due to the common pathophysiology and high prevalence of
coexistent PVD.[13]
history of acute kidney injury after administration of ACE inhibitor or
angiotensin II receptor antagonist (uncommon)
• This can be seen in some patients with bilateral RAS or RAS of a single functioning kidney, after
starting an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.
• Despite common belief that this class of medications is contraindicated in this population, renin-
angiotensin blockade is a proven therapeutic modality.[7] [16]
history of unexplained congestive heart failure (uncommon)
• Favors atherosclerotic RAS.[16] [19]
refractory angina (uncommon)
• Favors atherosclerotic RAS.[16]
history of hypokalemia (uncommon)
• Due to activation of the renin-angiotensin system.[7]
Risk factors
Strong
dyslipidemia
• Cholesterol deposition in the vessel walls, followed by inflammation and progression of the cholesterol
plaque.[1] [15]
smoking
• Favors endothelial inflammation and dysfunction.[1]
• Associated with both atherosclerotic and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).[14]
diabetes
• Causes endothelial dysfunction; major cardiovascular risk factor.[1]
Weak
female sex
• Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) more frequent in women than in males. Also, atherosclerotic RAS
more likely to progress in this population.[1] [2] [14]

duplex ultrasound
• Shows the renal arteries and measures flow velocity as a means of
assessing the severity of stenosis.[1] [31]
• Compares peak systolic velocity in the renal artery to that in the
adjacent aorta.
• Sensitive only for lesions with >50% reduction in vessel diameter, and
unable to provide further quantification of stenosis.
• Ultrasound criteria for significant renal artery stenosis:
• renal artery to aorta peak systolic velocity ratio (renal-aortic ratio)
>3.5
• peak systolic velocity >200 cm/sec with evidence of poststenotic
turbulence
• the presence of an end-diastolic velocity >150 cm/sec is suggestive
of >80% renal artery stenosis.
>50% reduction in vessel
diameter
gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography (MRA)
• Visualizes the renal arteries and perirenal aorta.[1]
• Use of gadolinium is recommended to be restricted in patients with
stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease, due to nephrogenic fibrosing
dermopathy.
• MRA is not available to patients with pacemakers, some aneurysm
clips, and other metal implants.
• Blooming artifact can cause overestimation of stenosis if calcification
is present.

conventional angiography
• Angiography is the most sensitive and specific test in the evaluation
of RAS.[1] [2]
• Possibility of performing intervention during the procedure.
• Can measure pressure gradients across stenotic lesion to determine
significance:
• by measurement with a <5F catheter or with a pressure wire, a
resting peak-to-peak gradient of ≥10 mmHg, or better a hyperemic
peak-to-peak gradient of ≥20mmHg, or a hyperemic mean gradient
of ≥7-10 mmHg is considered significant; hyperemia can be induced
with either dopamine or papaverine intra-arterially[32] [33]
• a trans-stenotic-to-aortic pressure ratio of <0.9, as measured by a
pressure wire across the stenotic lesion is considered significant,
either at rest or with provocation with vasodilators.[34]
• Angiography is an invasive procedure associated with known
complications, including hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, renal artery
dissection, atheroembolism, and acute kidney injury from intravenous
contrast exposure.

• Ultrasound diagnostic criteria for significant renal artery stenosis are:
• Renal artery to aorta peak systolic velocity ratio >3.5 (>50% stenosis)
• Peak systolic velocity >200 cm/sec with evidence of poststenotic turbulence (>50% stenosis)
• Peak systolic velocity >200 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocity >150 cm/sec (>80% renal artery
stenosis)
• Renal resistive index >0.8 was used as a criterion historically, but as resistive index is now known to be
influenced by extrarenal factors such as systemic hemodynamics, it is no longer routinely used in the
diagnosis of RAS.[28] [29]

Renal artery stenosis Management
MANAGEMENT
Approach
The majority of patients with RAS have refractory or difficult-to-control hypertension, regardless of the
etiology (fibromuscular dysplasia [FMD] versus atherosclerotic). Many patients may already be taking
multiple antihypertensive medications.
The addition of aspirin and high-intensity statins should follow as part of secondary prevention measures.
Control of other risk factors (such as tobacco cessation or glycemic control) is also recommended.
The role of percutaneous intervention remains controversial. It may be considered in patients with difficult-to-
control hypertension despite aggressive medical therapy, in the presence of test results confirmatory of RAS.
Other indications include a rapidly declining level of kidney function or recurrent flash pulmonary edema.
Patient factors that may suggest clinical benefit of revascularization include a recent onset or exacerbation
of hypertension (<1 year), absence of proteinuria, and identifiable activation of the renin-angiotensin system
(e.g., hyperreninemia).
Surgical intervention is generally reserved for patients with concomitant vascular disease (e.g., abdominal
aortic aneurysm [AAA]).
Only BP control with medications, with or without intervention, will prevent or limit end-organ damage, such
as progression of chronic kidney disease, and palliate some of the manifestations of this disease, such
as refractory pulmonary edema and angina. Patients with atherosclerotic RAS usually have concomitant
cardiovascular disease, which should be aggressively treated.
Lifestyle modification recommendations for all patients
Low-salt diet:
• May help improve BP in some patients.
Weight reduction:
• May help improve BP in some patients.
Smoking cessation:
• This is an important part of management in both atherosclerotic and FMD RAS patients.[14] [16]
Optimization of glycemic control:
• Tight glucose control with goal HbA1c <7% is known to decrease the risk of microvascular
complications.[36] However, tight glycemic control has not been shown to decrease risk of
macrovascular complications, and very tight control (HbA1c <6% to 6.5%) may worsen it.[37]
[38] Of antihyperglycemic agents, only metformin has been associated with possible reduced
macrovascular risk.[36]
Outline of antihypertensive medications
Renin-angiotensin blockade with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist is an attractive
first-line antihypertensive strategy, as the actions target the mechanism of hypertension in RAS.
Hypertension is a consequence of angiotensin II-related increase of systemic vascular resistance and
stimulation of sodium retention, and ACE inhibitors have the potential to correct this state. However, some
patients may not tolerate renin-angiotensin blockade, since GFR preservation may be dependent on high

angiotensin II effect at the efferent arteriole to maintain intraglomerular pressure. It is recommended that
BP, kidney function, and electrolytes be followed closely after initiating therapy.
First-line antihypertensives include captopril, enalapril, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The latter
have not been studied in this population, but are generally considered equivalent to ACE inhibitors.[39]
[40] [41] [42] Second-line preferences include thiazide or loop diuretics,[41] beta-blockers,[42] [43]
calcium-channel blockers,[41] [44] or prazosin.[41] Third-line choices include clonidine,[41] hydralazine,
methyldopa,[43] or minoxidil. Methyldopa and minoxidil are generally reserved for patients unresponsive
to all other therapies. Patients may require referral to a hypertension specialist (i.e., cardiologist or
nephrologist).
Medical therapy versus intervention for atherosclerotic RAS
There is evidence that percutaneous vascular intervention plus medical therapy is no better than
aggressive medical therapy alone.[45] Evidence from the largest randomized RAS clinical trial to date
(CORAL trial, n=947) suggests that percutaneous vascular intervention with stenting did not confer
a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to a comprehensive
aggressive and multifactorial medical therapy regimen in people with atherosclerotic RAS. Clinical
events in this trial were a composite end point of death from cardiovascular or renal causes, myocardial
infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need
for renal-replacement therapy. There were no specific subgroups with potential benefit.[46]
Therefore, renal artery percutaneous vascular intervention should be reserved for selected cases after
careful assessment by a vascular and endovascular specialist.
Atherosclerotic RAS first-line treatment: antihypertensive +
lifestyle modification + statin + aspirin
Antihypertensives
Statin:
• As atherosclerotic RAS is a type of vascular disease, statins should be considered for all patients.
Although direct evidence is lacking for this recommendation, the high prevalence of concomitant
peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) makes this recommendation
reasonable. However, there are no published studies evaluating particular statin drugs, doses,
or LDL cholesterol targets in this population. Weak evidence suggests that statins may slow the
progression of atherosclerotic RAS.[47] [48]
• Any statin may be used, with a target LDL cholesterol <70 to 100 mg/dL.
• Baseline and periodic evaluation of LFTs are recommended.
Antiplatelet therapy:
• Aspirin should be considered for all patients with atherosclerotic RAS, because of the high
likelihood of systemic cardiovascular disease.[16]
Atherosclerotic RAS second-line treatment: renal artery stenting
There are no data supporting renal artery stenting in asymptomatic patients in whom RAS is incidentally
found.[2]
Current randomized data do not support routine percutaneous vascular intervention (angioplasty with
or without stent deployment) in patients with atherosclerotic RAS.[45] Percutaneous intervention was

no better than medical therapy in decreasing clinical events such as death from cardiovascular or renal
causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progressive renal
insufficiency, or the need for renal-replacement therapy in the CORAL trial, with similar findings reported
in other studies.[45] [46] Therefore, renal artery revascularization should be considered only in selected
individuals after careful evaluation by a vascular/endovascular specialist.
Guidelines suggest renal artery stenting could be considered in the following circumstances in selected
individual patients, as discussed above:[3] [19] [45]

stenosis. Panel A, prior to stent placement. Panel B, after successful stent deployment.

• Recurrent flash pulmonary edema
• Stenosis of renal artery supplying single functioning kidney
• Refractory hypertension on a multidrug regimen (>3 medications)
• Patients with RAS, uncontrolled hypertension, and unstable angina
• Acute kidney injury on ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonist in patients with CHF.
Patient factors that may suggest clinical benefit of revascularization include a recent onset or
exacerbation of hypertension (<1 year), absence of proteinuria, and identifiable activation of the renin-
angiotensin system (e.g., hyperreninemia).
One Japanese study found that renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was associated with a
notable improvement in hypertension in those with atherosclerotic RAS.[49] Systolic blood pressure
decreased by 10±9 mmHg following revascularization, accompanied by an increase in heart rate of 4±11
bpm.[49]
Patients should be referred to an endovascular interventions specialist if percutaneous vascular
intervention is considered. Current medical therapy should be continued and maximized. Transient
addition of clopidogrel should be considered for dual antiplatelet therapy after the procedure.

Atherosclerotic RAS third-line treatment: surgery
Surgical reconstruction of the renal arteries in the setting of RAS is restricted to those patients undergoing
major aortic reconstruction for another reason, such as AAA repair or correction of severe aorto-
iliac occlusive disease.[16] Medical therapy should be continued with regular monitoring. Surgery is
associated with 1% to 6% mortality.
Fibromuscular dysplasia first-line treatment: antihypertensives
+ lifestyle modification + percutaneous renal artery balloon
angioplasty
Antihypertensives
Percutaneous renal artery balloon angioplasty:
• In addition to lifestyle modification and antihypertensive therapy, percutaneous renal artery balloon
angioplasty should be considered first-line therapy, as it is often curative. Angioplasty has an initial
technical success rate and 10-year patency rate of approximately 90%.[50]
• The prospective DYSART study found that invasive trans-stenotic pressure measurement using
a 4F catheter and guidewire was a more reliable indicator of procedural success in those with
fibromuscular dysplasia compared to imaging assessment.[51]
• One Japanese study found that renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was associated with
a notable improvement in hypertension in those with fibromuscular dysplasia.[49] Systolic blood
pressure decreased by 19±14 mmHg following revascularization, accompanied by an increase in
heart rate of 2±4 bpm.[49]
Stenting:
• Is not indicated for initial treatment except in cases of procedural complications during
percutaneous renal artery balloon angioplasty (i.e., renal artery dissection). It could be considered
in the setting of restenosis.[16]
• Patients undergoing renal artery stenting require dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel)
after the procedure.
Fibromuscular dysplasia second-line treatment: surgery
Surgical reconstruction of the renal arteries in the setting of FMD is restricted to those patients
undergoing major aortic reconstruction for another reason. Surgical intervention may be necessary in
complex disease that extends into the segmental arteries, and in cases of macroaneurysms.[16]
Medical therapy should be continued with regular monitoring.

» Stenting is not indicated for initial treatment
of fibromuscular dysplasia except in cases of
procedural complications during percutaneous
renal artery balloon angioplasty (i.e., renal artery
dissection). It could be considered in the setting
of restenosis.[16]
» Patients undergoing renal artery stenting
require dual antiplatelet therapy (with aspirin and
clopidogrel) following the procedure.
2nd surgical reconstruction of the renal
arteries
» Surgical reconstruction of the renal arteries
in the setting of fibromuscular dysplasia is
restricted to those patients undergoing major
aortic reconstruction for another reason. Surgical
intervention may be necessary in complex
disease that extends into the segmental arteries,
and in cases of macroaneurysms.[16]
Primary prevention
No studies have been done to evaluate primary prevention of atherosclerotic RAS. However, a reasonable
approach would suggest that aggressive cardiovascular risk factor modification may be beneficial.
Secondary prevention
• Patients should be referred to a nutrition specialist for evaluation and counseling regarding a low-salt,
low-cholesterol diet. Special populations may require more specific advice (i.e., patients with diabetes
or chronic kidney disease).
• Consideration should be given to enrollment in an exercise program. If this is not possible, patients
should be encouraged to exercise for half an hour every day.

Renal artery stenosis Management
MANAGEMENT
• Smoking cessation or noninitiation is advised.
Patient discussions
• Patients with RAS should understand that this is a chronic condition, likely to require close follow-
up and multiple medications and/or interventions. They should be encouraged to be adherent with
medications to achieve BP and lipid targets.  [Vascular Cures: renovascular hypertension] (http://
vascularcures.org/renovascular-hypertension)
• Patients can keep a log of their BP at home. They can obtain an electronic cuff, which should be
compared to the office standard sphygmomanometer once a year. They can check their BP about 3
times a day, at different times, recording these readings for review with their physician.
• In addition to being helpful in tailoring therapy and enlisting patients in their care, patients can be
instructed to call their physicians if their BP increases significantly.

Renal artery stenosis Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
• Close follow-up is required until adequate BP is achieved.
• Home BP monitoring is very helpful in assessing response to therapy.
• Periodic measurements (every 3 to 6 months) of creatinine and electrolytes are recommended.
These are also important 2 to 4 weeks after adjusting doses of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or
angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
• If there are clinical changes or if the hypertension becomes uncontrolled, it is reasonable to obtain
evaluation studies (invasive or noninvasive) to assess for progression of RAS.
• Surveillance Duplex ultrasonography may be useful in detecting restenosis early after the
procedure (up to 1 year). Primary patency rates after stenting are 80% to 85%; secondary patency
rates are 92% to 98%. Almost all occurrences of restenosis occur during the first year after stent
implantation.[2]

Renal artery stenosis Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
renin-angiotensin-associated orthostatic hypotension short term low
Occurs in approximately 10% of patients. May be associated with renin-angiotensin blockade.[59]
renin-angiotensin-associated symptomatic tachycardia short term low
Occurs in approximately 10% of patients.[60]
percutaneous intervention-associated inguinal
hematoma
short term low
Occurs in approximately 5% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.[65] [66]
percutaneous intervention-associated retroperitoneal
bleed
short term low
Occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.[67]
percutaneous intervention-associated femoral
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula
short term low
Occurs in approximately 5% to 7% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.[68]
percutaneous intervention-associated MI or stroke short term low
Occurs in approximately 0% to 5% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.[43] [64]
progression of stenosis long term medium
Most patients with high-degree stenosis (>75% reduction in vessel diameter) tend to progress to total
occlusion.[57] Approximately 10% of patients have unilateral stenosis >50%.[58]
progression of chronic kidney disease long term medium
Overall there is no difference in kidney outcomes between patients treated medically versus those
undergoing angioplasty.[54]
percutaneous intervention-associated renal artery
occlusion
long term low
Occurs in approximately 2% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.[68] [69]
percutaneous intervention-associated restenosis variable medium
Restenosis rates after percutaneous revascularization, with or without stenting, range from 10% to
21%.[54]
radiocontrast nephropathy variable low
Complication after CT angiogram or conventional angiography ± intervention.

Renal artery stenosis Follow up
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
Patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, or who receive larger contrast doses, are at increased
risk. Occurs in as many as 25% of these patients.[61] [62]
Causes acute renal failure. May require dialysis in a small percentage of patients.
N-acetylcysteine, bicarbonate, or saline IV prehydration and use of lowest possible doses of low-
osmolar/iso-osmolar contrast agents should be considered in order to decrease the risk for radiocontrast
nephropathy.[61] [62]
percutaneous intervention-associated atheroembolism variable low
Reported in 1% to 2% of patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.[54] [63] [64]
Prognosis
General outlook
Higher mortality and dialysis rates occur if there is worsening baseline kidney function, higher-grade stenosis,
extensive coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease, or older age.[54]
Hypertension control
In bilateral RAS, angioplasty with stent deployment may be more effective than medical treatment alone
regarding the goal of better BP control. Patients may require fewer medications for control of hypertension
after stenting. An exceedingly small percentage of patients may be cured of hypertension.[54]
Kidney function
Current evidence indicates that kidney outcomes are no different with medical therapy or interventional
therapy. However, kidney function improvement has only been reported in patients undergoing
angioplasty.[54]
Medical therapy vs. interventional procedures: complications
Evidence does not support meaningful conclusions about relative adverse events or complications of
percutaneous vascular intervention compared with medical treatment.[55] However, interventional therapy is
associated with complications related to the procedure.
Patients undergoing renal artery percutaneous vascular intervention (angioplasty with or without stent
deployment) require dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) after the procedure. This carries a risk
of bleeding.
Cardiovascular outcomes
There is no difference in cardiovascular outcomes between medical therapy and interventional
procedures.[46] [55] [56]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including

which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
