Marfan syndrome Overview
Summary
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder of connective tissue characterized by loss of
elastic tissue, resulting in musculoskeletal deformities, lens subluxation (dislocation), aortic dissection, and
root aneurysms.
Multidisciplinary team of specialists confirm the diagnosis clinically and genetically using fibrillin-1 gene
screen, and manage treatment options.
Dilation of the aorta may be progressive, but dilation may be delayed by beta-blockers or angiotensin-II
receptor antagonists or in combination. The risk of aortic dissection or rupture increases with the size of the
aortic dimension or with pregnancy.
Standard of elective surgical care for aortic dilation is modified David reimplantation operation with
preservation of aortic valve leaflets and replacement of the aortic root. A second operation is becoming more
widely available, namely PEARS extent operation, which bears the same 1% mortality risk when performed
electively by an experienced surgeon.
Acute aortic dissection generally requires immediate surgical repair and has reduced long-term survival.
Other manifestations of Marfan syndrome (e.g., lens subluxation and/or cataract, glaucoma, retinal
detachment, dural ectasia, scoliosis, and pulmonary complications) require treatment from appropriate
medical or surgical specialists.
Definition
This autosomal dominant inherited disorder of connective tissue, affects both men and women and is
characterized by loss of elastic tissue, affecting numerous body systems, including the musculoskeletal,
cardiovascular, neurologic, and respiratory systems, and the skin and eyes.[1] The diagnosis of classic
Marfan syndrome relies on a set of clinical criteria, defined by the Ghent nosology, where cardinal features
include aortic root aneurysm and ectopia lentis.[2] Diagnosis is confirmed either by the presence of these
two cardinal features, or by finding a causative mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene.[3] Children and adolescents
may not fulfill this formal diagnostic criteria and are often described as having “potential” Marfan based
on clinical features and a positive family history.[3] Skin striae, dural ectasia, hernias, pneumothorax, and
emphysematous bullae on chest x-ray may also be noted.[2]

Marfan syndrome Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Prevalence is thought to be similar throughout the world and regardless of sex or ethnicity.[5] Men and
women are affected equally, however men tend to be more severely affected in the cardiovascular system.
The incidence in the US population is not accurately known but is estimated to be 1 in 10,000.[6] The
incidence in the European population is estimated to be 3 in 10,000.[7] The average life expectancy used
to be only 32 years but due to early surgery, and general increase in life expectancy, is now 72 years
and approaching that of the general population.[8] Once aortic dissection occurs, survival is considerably
reduced to between 50% and 70% at 5 years.[9] [10]
Impact of aortic dissection on patient survival
From the collection of LG Svensson, E Mendrinos, C Pournaras
Etiology
Caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene in 99% of classical Marfan syndrome patients.[11] In 75% of
patients, the gene is passed on from a parent and is autosomal dominant, although the appearance of family
members and degree of pathologic features may vary. In 25% of patients the mutation occurs spontaneously
and may be associated with older paternal age.[4]
The first fibrillin-1 gene mutation was identified in 1990.[12] However, subsequently, over 3000 different
mutations have been identified.[13]
Pathophysiology
Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene result in the production of an abnormal fibrillin protein, leading to
abnormalities in the mechanical stability and elastic properties of connective tissue.[14] Up-regulation of C-
terminal fragment of filamin-A in dilated aortic media of Marfan syndrome has been found.[15] This is due

to cleavage by the protease calpain. Therefore, increased calpain activity may help to explain histologic
alterations in the dilated aorta.
Research suggests that transforming growth factor-beta is implicated in the failure of normal elastic tissue
formation.[16] [17]
Early experience from surgical treatment and histologic studies has found that patients suffer from a loss
of elastic tissue in the aortic wall (medial degeneration). Frequently, particularly in association with aortic
dissection, a loss of smooth muscle cells (medial necrosis) is also noted. In addition, a diagnosis of cystic
medial necrosis may be made, the so-called cysts being fluid collections of mucin and ground substance.
These abnormalities lead to a weakening of the aortic wall with subsequent aortic dilation and potentially
aortic dissection, aneurysms, and rupture. They also lead to a reduction of the structural integrity of the skin,
ligaments, eye lens zonules, lung airways, and the spinal dura.[16]
Classification
Type according to family history
Familial: 75% of cases; inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
Sporadic: 25% of cases; the mutation occurs spontaneously and may be associated with older paternal
age.[4]
Case history
Case history #1
In a routine medical examination, a young man is noted to be tall with a slight scoliosis and pectus
excavatum (breastbone is sunken into the chest). He had been told that he was over the 95% percentile
for height as a child. The examining physician suspects the patient has Marfan syndrome, and
auscultation reveals a heart murmur. Echocardiography shows an enlarged aortic root, aortic valve
regurgitation, and mitral valve prolapse.
Case history #2
A 34-year-old female, tall and slim, with bilateral dislocated lenses from birth, was diagnosed with Marfan
syndrome after the birth of her classically affected son, a long slim baby with arachnodactyly, indented
chest, and bilateral dislocated lenses. On echocardiography the mother was found to have a dilated aortic
root measuring 4.6 cm. Screening of the fibrillin-1 gene revealed a causative mutation in both mother
and son. No other family members carried the mutation. The mother's aortic root was replaced at age
35, followed by thoracoabdominal aortic replacement at age 69. She died at age 73 of a stroke due to a
cerebral bleed. Her son had aortic root replacement at age 17 and awaits abdominal aortic replacement
at age 40. His son aged 5 carries the same mutation and suffers from bilateral lens dislocation, and aortic
root dilation at age 5.

Other presentations
Acute aortic dissection commonly causes sudden-onset chest, back, shoulder or abdominal pain. Clinical
presentations related to musculoskeletal problems (e.g., scoliosis), hernias, or ophthalmic refractive
errors are less common. The main ocular symptoms are blurred vision and monocular diplopia caused by
progressive lens subluxation and resulting severe astigmatism.

Marfan syndrome Diagnosis
Approach
History and physical exam (including slit-lamp ophthalmic examination with pupil dilation) in conjunction with
imaging of the aortic root and the ascending, descending, and abdominal aorta (echo, computed tomography
[CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are usually sufficient for diagnosis.[1]
Use of diagnostic criteria
The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is clinically based using well-defined criteria, namely the revised
Ghent diagnostic criteria.[2] [3] This revised diagnostic criteria put more weight on cardiovascular
manifestations of the disorder, compared with previously used criteria, with aortic root aneurysm and
ectopia lentis now becoming cardinal features.[2] [3]
Identification of risk factors
Risk factors include the presence of a family history of Marfan syndrome, or of aortic dissection or
aneurysm. There is also a weak association with high paternal age.[4]
Other historical considerations
There may be a family history of myopia, astigmatism, strabismus, amblyopia, premature cataract or
other lens abnormalities, glaucoma, retinal detachment, dental extraction or braces for dental crowding,
hernias, or spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients may have a history of joint pain or low back ache.[1]
Physical examination
Tall stature, wide arm span, high level of pubic bone, high arched palate, arachnodactyly, positive wrist
and thumb sign, pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, scoliosis, striae (other than from pregnancy/
weight change), flat feet, thick eye glasses for myopia, hernias, aortic or mitral valve murmur may be
present.[2] [3] Spontaneous pneumothorax or emphysematous bullae may present as dyspnea.[3]
Skeletal abnormality may result in other pulmonary complications also presenting as dyspnea.
There may be signs of heart failure due to valve disease or cardiomyopathy.[18]
A complete ophthalmic exam, including fundus examination with pupil dilation, is recommended in
all patients. There may be signs of lens subluxation or dislocation, cataract, glaucoma, or retinal
detachment.[3]
It is possible that the patient may present with signs and symptoms of acute aortic dissection or rupture.
This presentation is covered in the complications section.

Initial investigations
Echocardiography is used initially for aortic root imaging and if not clearly determined CT or MRI may be
used.[3] [19]
Subsequent investigations
Genetic screening for mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene can confirm the diagnosis if in doubt.[3]
In the absence of lens dislocation, genetic testing should be considered to exclude the possibility of
Loeys-Dietz syndrome.[19] Once detected, the mutation can be used to screen other relatives, and
used for prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. This test is more specific than MRI
for dural ectasia, which can also be found in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. If there are existing genetic test
results, do not order a duplicate test unless there is uncertainty about the existing result, e.g., the result is
inconsistent with the patient’s clinical presentation or the test methodology has changed.[20]
Abdominal ultrasound, CT, and MRI are used for visualization of the descending aorta.[19]
Chest x-ray may be performed to exclude the presence of a pneumothorax and may reveal
emphysematous bullae.
Lower spine CT scan or MRI can be performed to exclude dural ectasia, where upright imaging may be
preferred.[3] This is a widening of the dural membrane surrounding the spinal cord and is a recognized
complication of Marfan syndrome. MRI is particularly useful for follow-up investigations to avoid
accumulative radiation, assessing aortic size and extent of any dural ectasia.
Plasma homocysteine levels help in unclear cases to differentiate homocystinuria.

Criteria
Revised Ghent nosology for the Marfan syndrome[2]
An international expert panel has established a revised Ghent nosology that puts more weight on the
cardiovascular manifestations (in particular, aortic root aneurysm) and ectopia lentis, which are the cardinal
clinical features. The presence of these 2 features are sufficient for the unequivocal diagnosis of Marfan
syndrome. In the absence of either of these 2, the presence of a bona fide fibrillin-1 (FBN1) mutation or
a combination of systemic manifestations is required. These criteria may delay a definitive diagnosis of
Marfan syndrome, but will decrease the risk of premature diagnosis or misdiagnosis and facilitate worldwide
discussion of risk and management guidelines.[36] [37] Dural ectasia is no longer a major finding as it is
nonspecific and also found in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
In the absence of family history any of the following are sufficient for a definitive diagnosis of Marfan
syndrome:
• Aortic root ≥+2 z-score and ectopia lentis
• Aortic root ≥+2 z-score and FBN1 mutation known to be associated with Marfan syndrome
• Aortic root ≥+2 z-score and systemic score ≥7 (see below)
• Ectopia lentis and FBN1 mutation known to be associated with Marfan syndrome
In the presence of family history, one of the following would meet the criteria for a diagnosis of Marfan
syndrome:
• Ectopia lentis
• Systemic score ≥7
• Aortic root ≥+3 z-score in those <20 years OR ≥ +2 z-score in those >20 years
Systemic features are scored as follows:
• Wrist AND thumb sign = 3 (wrist OR thumb sign = 1)
• Pectus carinatum deformity = 2 (pectus excavatum or chest asymmetry = 1)
• Hindfoot deformity = 2 (plain pes planus = 1)
• Pneumothorax = 2
• Dural ectasia = 2
• Protrusio acetabuli = 2
• Reduced upper segment/lower segment ratio AND increased arm/height AND no severe scoliosis = 1
• Scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis = 1
• Reduced elbow extension = 1
• Facial features (3/5) = 1 (dolichocephaly, enophthalmos, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar
hypoplasia, retrognathia)
• Skin striae = 1
• Myopia >3 diopters = 1
• Mitral valve prolapse (all types) = 1
Maximum total: 20 points; score ≥7 indicates systemic involvement

Marfan syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
A diagnosis of “potential Marfan syndrome” is given when there is a FBN1 pathogenic mutation not
previously known to be associated with Marfan syndrome and aortic root with a z-score of <+3.[3]
Screening
Genetic screening for fibrillin-1 gene mutations may be used for screening of other family members, including
prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis.[3] [38]

Marfan syndrome Management
Approach
No curative treatment exists, so management aims to prevent cardiac, ophthalmologic, and musculoskeletal
complications, and will vary with individual symptoms.[3] [39]
Aortic dilation
Aortic dilation, dissection, and rupture all occur in people with Marfan syndrome. All patients with a
Marfan syndrome diagnosis should be followed by a cardiologist with expertise in this area.[3] Aortic
dissection and rupture are considered as complications of the syndrome, whereas aortic dilation is
considered part of the syndrome.
Beta-blockers are an established treatment for Marfan syndrome as they reduce heart rate and
myocardial contractility, and slow aortic root growth, reducing the risk of complications such as aortic
dissection and rupture.[19] [40] [41][42] 
More recently, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists have been found to be efficacious in Marfan
syndrome.[19] Approximately 20% of children with Marfan syndrome have asthma, and in these children
beta-blockers are relatively contraindicated due to a risk of bronchospasm. Using cardioselective beta-
blockers is likely to reduce this risk.[43] An angiotensin-II receptor antagonist may be used in these
patients instead.[44]
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treatment with either a beta-blocker or an angiotensin-
II receptor antagonist in patients with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilatation, with consideration of
combination treatment where there is severe and/or progressive aortic root dilatation.[3] The American
Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) also recommends either treatment option
and suggests combination therapy is reasonable to reduce the rate of aortic dilation citing a meta-analysis
which confirmed slower aortic growth rates with combination therapy.[19] [45]
Elective surgery is recommended once aortic diameter measures 4.5 to 5.0 cm (earlier in symptomatic
patients with chest pain).[19] [46] [47] [48] The measurement of the aortic root/body height ratio is taken
into account in children and if this ratio is >10, elective surgery is likely, but the decision of exactly when
to operate may vary between surgeons and needs to be performed by experienced surgeons as part of
a multidisciplinary aortic team.[19] Surgery is indicated earlier (at aortic diameter >4.2 cm) in women of
reproductive age. In women who are pregnant, there is a significant risk of dissection when the aortic root
is ≥4.2 cm.[49]
In patients with an aortic diameter approaching surgical threshold, who are candidates for valve-sparing
root replacement and have a very low surgical risk, the AHA and ACC recommend that surgery to
replace the aortic root and ascending aorta may be reasonable if performed by an experienced team.[19]
Modified David reimplantation with replacement of the aortic root and sparing of the aortic valve has a
91% to 97% freedom from reoperation at 10 years if performed at a center with sufficient experience
and a low postoperative death rate after elective procedure <1%.[50] [51] A second-line surgical option
is replacement of the aortic root with a composite Dacron graft and mechanical valve, but this is now
only indicated outside the centers performing modified David aortic valve reimplantation. Lastly, the root
remodeling operation has been found to have worse results than the David reimplantation operation.
Following surgery for severe aortic dilation, lifelong therapy with beta-blockers (or an angiotensin-
II receptor antagonist if beta-blockers are contraindicated/not tolerated) is indicated. Patients with
mechanical valves will need lifelong warfarin therapy, and any patient who has prosthetic material, either

[53]
Musculoskeletal findings and dural ectasia
Musculoskeletal concerns are often the presenting feature of patients with Marfan syndrome.[3] Scoliosis
and kyphoscoliosis are frequently seen in growing teenagers. Curves of 20 to 40 degrees will require
orthopedic bracing, and for larger curves, surgical correction with Harrington rods and spinal fusion is
required. Telescopic rods are becoming increasingly popular for young children.[54] Spondylolisthesis <30
degrees is also treated with bracing, whereas a larger slippage will require surgical realignment.
Pectus excavatum and carinatum are usually corrected surgically only if there is cardiopulmonary
compromise. Surgery is not indicated for cosmetic reasons because of potential risks, unless serious
psychological problems occur with body image. Experimental work with pressure bracing for pectus
carinatum and suction for excavatum is promising.[55]
Arthritic pain is managed medically, but advanced arthritis in adults due to protrusio acetabulae may
necessitate hip replacement. Mild painkillers and orthopedic arch supports and footwear may be given in
cases of painful flat feet, with foot surgery only rarely becoming necessary.
Physical and/or occupational therapy can help address joint laxity issues.[3] Dural ectasia is mostly
asymptomatic and will only rarely need treatment, such as analgesics for lower back pain or neurosurgery
should neurologic symptoms occur (e.g., orthostatic headache, pain or numbness in legs).
Ophthalmologic findings
The most common ocular feature is myopia, typically attributed to elongation of the globe. This often
progresses rapidly during childhood.[3] [24] Refractive errors are corrected with spectacles/contact
lenses or may need surgery. Young children are at risk for amblyopia and require refraction and close
monitoring.[3] [56] Ectopia lentis (dislocation of the lens) is treated either with spectacles/contact lenses
or with surgery. Cataracts are treated by surgical removal of the lens and contact lenses if tolerated by the
patient, or intraocular lens implantation in the posterior or anterior chamber.[57] Glaucoma requires either
medication or surgery, or a combination of both. See Open-angle glaucoma  and Angle-closure glaucoma
.
Retinal tears or retinal detachment require immediate attention. Argon laser photocoagulation or
transconjunctival cryocoagulation is required for retinal tears, whereas surgical repair is needed in cases
of retinal detachment. Unilateral retinal detachments may go unnoticed by patients, due to maintenance of
vision in the unaffected eye, so routine vision assessments of each eye in isolation are recommended.[3]
Affected individuals should be monitored at least annually by an ophthalmologist familiar with Marfan
syndrome with slit-lamp exams for lens subluxation and cataract formation, glaucoma, and fundus exams
for retinal tears or detachments.[3]
Pregnancy
Pregnancy is associated with an increase in aortic root size.[58][59] Reported aortic dissection rates
during pregnancy range from 1.9% to 4.4%.[59] [60] Aortic size is a major determinant of risk, and
guidelines recommend that women with aortic root diameter >45 mm avoid pregnancy.[46] [61]

Marfan syndrome Management
Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists should be stopped due to the risk of fetal harm.[3] There is a risk of
fetal growth restriction with beta-blockers in pregnancy; however, they can generally be continued with
close fetal growth monitoring.[3] [62]
Women with aortic dimensions greater than 4.0 cm are at risk for aortic complications during pregnancy
and the postpartum period. Therefore, pregnancy should be delayed if possible until after definitive
treatment of the aorta has been completed. Elective surgery to replace a dilated aortic root prior to a
planned pregnancy in a Marfan syndrome woman, should be performed when aortic root diameter is 4.2
cm or greater, to avoid the increased risk of dissection due to hormone influence during pregnancy. The
patient should be advised to wait one year after surgery before becoming pregnant.[63] [64]
Those whose aorta is greater than 4.5 cm, or those who have previously had an aortic dissection
or rupture, are at substantially higher risk.[3] [65] If already pregnant, clinicians should consider
immediate aortic replacement, early delivery, or termination of the pregnancy, given the potentially severe
consequences.[3] [66] [67]
The rate of spontaneous abortion has been reported as higher-than-expected in women with Marfan
syndrome, although the etiology is unknown.[3] [68] In addition, women with Marfan syndrome experience
higher rates of preterm deliveries, premature rupture of membranes, and increased mortality of their
offspring.[3] [68] [69]

External stent to support aorta
This innovative procedure involves a mesh tube, custom-made using computer-aided design, wrapped
around the root of the aorta. Long-term follow-up is underway to evaluate the procedure which is increasingly
available in specialized centers.[48] [79] [80] [81] Perioperative mortality is low, and less than that for open
heart surgery.[82] The advantages of this personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) technique
include shorter operation time, more rapid recovery, and lack of need for lifelong anticoagulant therapy.
Secondary prevention
Any patient who has prosthetic material, either valve or graft, will require antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive
procedures.[52] [53] 
Patients with mechanical valves will need lifelong warfarin therapy.[53]
Children require repeated refraction measurements to prevent amblyopia.
Patient discussions
The recommendations concerning which sports are safe in these often young patients can be difficult.
Children and adolescents with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk for physical injury and medical
complications with physical activity and of particular concern are contact sports, activities with "burst"
exertion (such as sprinting) and intense isometric exertion such as weight lifting.[3] In patients with
significant aortic disease guidance should be provided to avoid intense isometric exercises, burst exertion,
and collision sports.[19] Patients without aortic dilatation, significant valve regurgitation or ventricular
dysfunction can be encouraged to participate in recreational physical activity but this is still limited by
the intensity of the activity.[3] The American Heart Association provides recommendations for Marfan
syndrome and physical activity which grades individual sports and their suitability.[92]
Patients are instructed to seek immediate ocular examination if they develop ophthalmologic symptoms
such as the perception of floaters (myodesopsia), flashing lights (photopsia), glare, or visual-field defect.
Women who are planning a pregnancy should be offered preconception counseling; this would ideally
be provided by a geneticist or cardiologist familiar with Marfan syndrome, a genetic counselor, and
a perinatologist.[3] Based on a known causative fibrillin-1 mutation in either parent, prepregnancy
counseling should include advice regarding options of antenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus biopsy at 11
weeks' gestation, or preimplantation genetic diagnosis to ensure an unaffected fetus.[38] [93]

Marfan syndrome Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends cardiac exam at each visit up to the age of 13 years
after which it is recommended annually. Echocardiogram is recommended at diagnosis with a repeat test
after 6 months - most children will then require an annual echocardiogram (though frequency depends
on the z-score and may be more often) along with ophthalmological review annually. Assessment for
scoliosis, joint laxity, and pectus deformity should be carried out at each visit up to the age of 1 year, then
annually from age 1 to 5 years and 6 monthly from the age of 6 to 18 years.[3]
Ideally a cardiologist familiar with Marfan syndrome should be involved with follow-up. If echocardiogram
does not clearly demonstrate aortic root dimensions computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) can be used - MRA is recommended for serial studies due to radiation associated
with CT.[3]
Patients who have undergone an aortic root replacement require surveillance imaging by MRI or CT
initially annually and then every 2 years if unchanged.[19] In these patients surveillance for abdominal
aortic aneurysm every 3-5 years is considered reasonable.[19]
Patients with Marfan syndrome also need routine eye care for optical correction of refractive errors,
periodic monitoring of intraocular pressure, and anterior segment examination with a slit-lamp to assess
the eye for lens location and opacities. Fundus exam with pupil dilation is routinely performed in all cases,
with particular attention to peripheral retinal changes, tears, or detachment.

Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
coronary ostial aneurysm following aortic repair long term low
Risk dependent on method used to reattach the coronary artery button.
acute aortic dissection/rupture variable high
May present with: severe, stabbing, sudden-onset chest pain; absent pulses; confusion; tachycardia; loss
of consciousness; signs of abdominal ischemia; differing BP in different arms, wide pulse pressure due to
aortic regurgitation, or distant heart sounds secondary to tamponade.
Left shoulder, back, or abdominal pain is not infrequent.
Requires immediate surgery, once confirmed by echo and CT scan/MRI of the thorax. Exceptions are
previous cardiac surgery, dissection more than a few days old, history of CAD, and anticoagulation
therapy. Uncomplicated acute dissection of the descending aorta (type B) may initially be managed
medically.[19]
Cardiac catheterization is recommended in patients with previous cardiac surgery and those with possible
CAD.
Acute dissection beyond the left subclavian artery is initially treated medically, unless there is evidence of
distal ischemia.
Following surgery for aortic dissection, lifelong therapy with beta-blockers (or an angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist if beta-blockers are contraindicated/not tolerated) is indicated.
chronic aortic dissection variable high
Usually seen after previous cardiac surgery.
Patients require extensive workup for surgery. Most require initial aortic arch replacement beyond a
previous ascending aortic graft insertion using the so-called elephant trunk procedure.[87]
A second-stage elephant trunk procedure is required 2 to 4 months postoperatively.
In many patients, the entire aorta is replaced because of the dissected weakened aorta becoming
aneurysmal.
Following surgery for aortic dissection, lifelong therapy with beta-blockers (or an angiotensin-II receptor
antagonist if beta-blockers are contraindicated/not tolerated) is indicated.
continued aortic dilation variable medium
The weakened aortic wall is still too stressed by pulsatile flow.
If dilation is beyond 2 mm every 6 months or aortic root area/body height ratio of 10 despite drug
treatment, surgical referral is recommended.

Marfan syndrome Follow up
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
symptomatic aortic regurgitation variable medium
Occurs with aortic root dilation.
spontaneous pneumothorax variable medium
May be recurrent. Preventative surgery is recommended after 1 to 3 episodes, depending on severity.[89]
[90]
symptomatic inguinal/abdominal/incisional hernia variable medium
May be recurrent so use of mesh strongly recommended during first repair.[91]
severe mitral regurgitation variable low
Mitral valve prolapse often progresses to severe mitral valve regurgitation, especially in females.
Surgery is indicated when regurgitation either becomes severe (grade 4+) or symptomatic or there is
evidence of hemodynamic compromise.[88]
infective endocarditis variable low
Low risk in David reimplantation; high risk in composite valve graft procedure.
heart failure variable low
Heart valve disease or intrinsic cardiomyopathy may occur and require referral to a cardiologist.
Prognosis
Life expectancy of a patient with Marfan syndrome is approximately the same as the general population
with a timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management.[3] The most important factors in treatment of
Marfan syndrome are the diagnosis of the condition, careful long-term follow-up for aortic expansion, referral
for surgery when the aortic root area/body height ratio reaches 10 or aortic root diameter in the sinus of
Valsalva reaches 4.5 to 5.0 cm, and emergency surgery for acute dissection. Long-term survival is excellent
with beta-blocker control and surgery when indicated. Acute dissection results in a reduced survival even if
successfully treated.[9] [10] However, early diagnosis followed by modern medical and surgical management
has definitely improved quality and length of life.[84]
Aortic surgery during pregnancy has increased the chance of preservation of lives of both mother and
baby.[85] [86]

and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,

accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
