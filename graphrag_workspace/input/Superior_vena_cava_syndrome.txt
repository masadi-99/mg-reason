Superior vena cava syndrome Overview
Summary
Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a clinical condition that occurs due to obstruction of the SVC.
The most common etiology is malignancy; however, there has been an increase in benign causes due to
more frequent use of intravascular devices.
Although rarely fatal, it may sometimes present as life-threatening upper airway obstruction.
A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in many cases.
Treatment and prognosis depend on underlying etiology.
Definition
Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a clinical condition that occurs as a result of obstruction of the SVC,
leading to interrupted venous return from the head, thorax, and upper extremities to the right atrium. The
increased venous pressure results in edema of the head, neck, and arms, often with cyanosis, plethora,
and distended subcutaneous vessels.[1] [2] It can be caused by either intraluminal obstruction of the SVC or
extrinsic compression.

Superior vena cava syndrome Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome occurs in approximately 15,000 people in the US every year.[1]
Malignancy causes 65% of cases, lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma being the most common.
Malignant causes of SVC syndrome are more frequent in middle-aged to older adult males, while benign
causes are equally distributed across both sexes and more commonly seen in the younger population.
Infectious causes (especially syphilitic aortic aneurysm and tuberculosis) accounted for the majority of cases
50 years ago but are now rare, especially in developed countries.[7] Malignant causes accounted for >90%
of cases around 25 years ago, but there has been an increase in benign causes of SVC syndrome, reflecting
increased use of intravascular devices such as catheters, pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators,
and cardiac resynchronization therapy.[8]
Etiology
A total of 65% to 70% of cases are due to malignancy.[1] [2] Lung cancer is the most common etiology, with
non-small cell lung cancer accounting for 50% of cases of malignant superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome
and small cell lung cancer for 25% cases.[9] [10] [11] Overall, 2% to 5% of all patients with lung cancer
go on to develop SVC syndrome, while 10% to 20% of patients with small cell lung cancer develop the
condition. This is most likely related to the central growth of these tumors.[12] Most patients with lung cancer-
associated SVC syndrome have right-sided lesions (80%). Lymphoma is the second most common cause,
accounting for 12% of cases of malignant SVC syndrome; diffuse large cell lymphoma is the most common
type (two-thirds), followed by lymphoblastic lymphoma (one third). Of patients with primary mediastinal B-
cell lymphoma with sclerosis (a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma), the prevalence of SVC syndrome
is high, with one study reporting 57%.[13] Although Hodgkin lymphoma often involves the mediastinum, SVC
syndrome is rare.[14] Thymoma (2%) and germ cell tumors (3%) are other primary mediastinal malignancies
that occasionally cause SVC syndrome.[15]
The most common metastatic disease that causes SVC syndrome is breast cancer, accounting for 11%
of cases.[6] Other metastatic tumors that cause SVC syndrome include colon cancer, esophageal cancer,
Kaposi sarcoma, and fibrous mesothelioma.
Benign causes of SVC syndrome are less frequent (30%-35%).[1] [2] They include iatrogenic causes
associated with SVC thrombosis (e.g., central venous catheters, pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator leads), mediastinal fibrosis caused by radiation therapy or infections (e.g., histoplasmosis,
tuberculosis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, or nocardiosis), collagen-vascular diseases like sarcoidosis
or Behcet syndrome, and, rarely, aortic arch aneurysm, large substernal goiter, mediastinal hematoma
as a result of trauma, and bicaval anastomotic stenosis following cardiac transplantation.[1] [11] [16]
Complications of pacemaker lead placement, such as venous thrombosis and stenosis, occur in up to 30% of
patients, but only a few patients become symptomatic; however, the presence of multiple leads, retention of
severed lead(s), and previous lead infection may increase risk of SVC syndrome.
In children, SVC syndrome is most often caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The compression of the SVC
may be associated with compression of the trachea, which is narrow, flexible, and soft relative to that of an
adult. This may result in airway obstruction in children.

Superior vena cava syndrome Theory
Pathophysiology
The superior vena cava (SVC) extends from the junction of the right and left brachiocephalic veins to the right
atrium. It drains venous blood from the head, neck, upper extremities, and upper thorax to the right atrium. It
is located in the middle mediastinum and is surrounded by structures including the trachea, right bronchus,
aorta, pulmonary artery, and the perihilar and paratracheal lymph nodes.
The thin-walled SVC can be obstructed by intraluminal, mural, or extrinsic factors. The extent and rapidity of
obstruction correlates with elevation of venous pressure and symptomatic presentation. Slowly progressive
obstruction leads to recruitment of collateral circulation via the azygos and internal mammary venous
system (which takes several weeks).[17] With obstruction of the SVC, the cervical venous pressure is
usually increased to 20 to 40 mmHg (normal range 2-8 mmHg).[18] When obstruction occurs abruptly, SVC
syndrome can constitute a medical emergency.
An obstructed SVC initiates collateral venous return to the heart from the upper half of the body through
four principal pathways. The most important pathway is the azygos venous system, which includes the
azygos vein, the hemiazygos vein, and the connecting intercostal veins. The second pathway is the internal
mammary venous system plus tributaries and secondary communications to the superior and inferior
epigastric veins. The long thoracic venous system, with its connections to the femoral veins and vertebral
veins, provides the third and fourth collateral routes, respectively.[1]
Classification
Classification based on location of superior vena cava (SVC)
obstruction
Preazygos or supra-azygos
• Obstruction of blood return above the entrance of azygos vein into the SVC, resulting in venous
distension and edema of the face, neck, and upper extremities.[3] [4]
Postazygos or infra-azygos
• Obstruction below the entrance of azygos vein into the SVC results in retrograde flow through the
azygos via collaterals to the inferior vena cava, resulting in not only the symptoms and signs of
preazygos disease, but also dilation of the veins over the abdomen.
• This is usually more severe and poorly tolerated than preazygos obstruction.

Superior vena cava syndrome Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
The diagnosis of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is usually clinical and requires a high degree of
suspicion; thus, a good history and physical examination is important. Chest CT/MRI is the initial test
of choice required to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for underlying etiology. Obtaining tissue for
histopathology may be required in cases of suspected malignancy or infection.
History
History may also be notable for smoking, multiple pacemaker leads, or central venous catheters. Previous
history of radiation exposure should be noted, as excess radiation to the mediastinum can lead to fibrosis
causing SVC obstruction.
Early in the course, partial SVC obstruction may be asymptomatic or associated with subtle symptoms.
With progressive obstruction, the classic symptoms and signs become more obvious. The most common
symptoms are facial swelling, dyspnea, cough, arm swelling, and facial plethora.[1] [2] Sudden-onset
dyspnea due to laryngeal edema can be fatal as a result of upper airway compromise.[5] Other symptoms
include headache, chest pain, blurred vision, hoarseness of voice, and stridor. Symptoms are usually
worsened by bending forward or lying down.
History of associated anorexia, weight loss, cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis may suggest lung
malignancy (or possibly chronic infection). Fever, skin rash, or arthralgias may be indicative of underlying
collagen-vascular diseases.
Physical examination
Examination usually reveals engorged veins of the neck and upper chest wall, facial edema, and
upper-extremity edema. Prominent collateral veins covering the anterior chest wall may be visible.
The maneuver of bending forward usually worsens venous engorgement and is a helpful clinical sign.
Laryngeal edema, cyanosis, papilledema, mental changes, stupor, and even coma have been described
with severe obstruction.[1] [6] When lymphadenopathy is present outside the chest, lymphoma should be
considered a possibility.
Investigations
Chest x-ray may be performed as an initial test and sometimes reveals a widened mediastinum or mass
lesion in the lung, but the most important radiologic investigation when diagnosis is clinically suspected
is CT of the chest (with intravenous contrast).[1] [2] It establishes the diagnosis of SVC obstruction
and shows the exact location, severity, and associated pathology (e.g., malignancy or intravascular
thrombosis). MRI may also be useful but does not have any distinct advantages over CT, except in
patients with contrast allergy or renal failure, as it avoids iodinated contrast.[1] [2]
Ultrasound of the upper extremities is a useful noninvasive screening test and helps in identification of
venous thrombosis or obstruction.[2] [19] Presence of monophasic flow in the SVC or loss of respiratory
variation on Doppler ultrasound can suggest SVC obstruction.
Bilateral upper-extremity venography can accurately delineate the site and extent of SVC obstruction and
collateral pathways, but does not provide information about lung and mediastinal pathology. Venography
is usually not required for diagnosis, but may be helpful to plan stent placement or surgery.[1] [2]

Superior vena cava syndrome Diagnosis
Other investigations
Obtaining a tissue diagnosis is important to confirm the presence of malignancy. A biopsy from
supraclavicular or other cervical lymph nodes may obviate the need for invasive procedures like
mediastinoscopy, and thus careful examination for cervical lymphadenopathy should be performed. For
diagnosis of malignancy, bronchoscopy has a diagnostic yield of 50% to 70%, transthoracic needle-
aspiration biopsy has a yield of approximately 75%, and mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy has a
diagnostic yield of >90%.[1]
Sputum examination for culture, acid-fast staining, and cytology is helpful in diagnosis of cases with
tuberculosis, fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, nocardiosis), or
endobronchial malignancy. Thoracentesis with cytologic analysis should be strongly considered whenever
pleural effusion is present.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein may be elevated in patients with infection or
immunologic disorders.

Superior vena cava syndrome Management
Approach
Once diagnosis has been established, a malignant or nonmalignant cause of superior vena cava (SVC)
syndrome must be determined, as treatment options differ. Treatment involves relieving the symptoms of
obstruction and treating the underlying etiology. There have been no large randomized trials to compare
various treatment options, and most data are from case series and expert opinion. Treatment of SVC
syndrome is interdisciplinary and may involve oncology, respiratory, surgery, radiology, vascular, and
endovascular specialists.[2]
Acute airway obstruction (without tissue diagnosis)
Presentation with airway obstruction is serious, although rare in current clinical practice. First-line
treatment consists of securing the airway and relief of obstructive symptoms. This can be achieved
with either a combination of corticosteroids and radiation therapy, or percutaneous stenting.[2] Urgent
treatment with radiation therapy and corticosteroids should be used only for life-threatening situations.
It should be deferred otherwise due to interference with subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. Stenting
is increasingly used because the stent can be placed before a tissue diagnosis is available. It is a
useful procedure for patients with severe symptoms such as respiratory distress that require urgent
intervention.[21] [22] Meta-analyses have demonstrated that endovascular therapy with stenting has high
technical and clinical success rates.[23] [24] [25]
In the absence of a need for urgent intervention, the management should focus initially on establishing
the correct diagnosis.
Malignant obstructions
Malignant causes require further treatment with appropriate chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery.
Most malignant tumors causing SVC syndrome are sensitive to radiation therapy. Chemotherapy is an
effective option for treatment of lung cancer, lymphomas, and germ cell tumors.[26] Thymomas that
are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation may require surgical resection and SVC reconstruction.[27]
Selection of therapy will depend on the type of malignancy, staging, and histopathology. See Small cell
lung cancer , Non-small cell lung cancer , Non-Hodgkin lymphoma , Thymic tumor .
Endovascular stenting is performed to achieve more rapid improvement in symptoms and has fewer side
effects compared with radiation therapy.[23] [24] [25]
Second line treatment is palliative therapy. This includes palliative radiation therapy, chemotherapy or
corticosteroids (for lymphomas and thymomas), endovascular stents, or rarely bypass surgery.[1] [2] In
rare cases, surgical decompression can be performed. Thrombolysis with indwelling catheters has also
been described in small studies.[28] Supportive treatment consists of diuretics, low-salt diet, avoidance of
upper-extremity lines, head elevation, and oxygen.
Benign obstructions
Benign causes can be managed with percutaneous stenting, intravascular thrombolysis, bypass grafting,
anticoagulation, or treatment of underlying infectious etiology.
Underlying infection (e.g., aspergillosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, nocardiosis) should be treated
according to local sensitivities. Endovascular stents and more rarely bypass surgery may be required if
SVC obstruction persists after treatment of infection.

Superior vena cava syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
Catheter(s) should be removed and local thrombolysis and/or short-course anticoagulation should be
considered in patients with thrombosis due to central venous catheter(s).[29]
Percutaneous balloon dilatation/stenting is preferred in patients with pacemaker and implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator lead-related venous occlusion. Lead explantation may carry a high risk of
mortality.[30] Bypass surgery may be an option. Infection of the leads should always be considered as a
possibility and evaluated with blood cultures and transesophageal echocardiogram. Anticoagulation with
warfarin should be considered. Data regarding post-procedural anticoagulation are lacking, and practices
vary.[2]

Treatment algorithm
Please note that formulations/routes and doses may differ between drug names and brands, drug
formularies, or locations. Treatment recommendations are specific to patient groups: see disclaimer
Acute
acute airway obstruction (without
tissue diagnosis)
1st secure airway + radiation therapy +
corticosteroids
Primary options
» dexamethasone sodium phosphate: 10 mg
intravenous bolus initially, followed by 4 mg
every 6 hours
» Airway should be secured by intubation or
surgically first.
» Urgent treatment with radiation therapy and
corticosteroids should be used only for life-
threatening situations. It should be deferred
otherwise, due to interference with subsequent
histopathologic diagnosis.
» Dose of corticosteroids should be limited
and the dose decreased after 1 to 2 days
of treatment or following symptomatic
improvement.
1st secure airway + percutaneous
endovascular stenting
» Airway should be secured by intubation or
surgically first.
» Becoming increasingly used, because the
stent can be placed before a tissue diagnosis
is available. It is a useful procedure for patients
with severe symptoms such as respiratory
distress that require urgent intervention.[21]
[22] Meta-analyses have demonstrated that
endovascular therapy with stenting has high
technical and clinical success rates.[23] [24] [25]
» Done percutaneously by obtaining access
usually through the femoral vein. Performed
under conscious sedation. Fluoroscopic
guidance and iodinated contrast are used. Most
operators use heparin during the procedure.

Superior vena cava syndrome Management
Ongoing
malignant etiology
1st treatment of malignancy
» Most malignant tumors causing superior vena
cava (SVC) syndrome are sensitive to radiation
therapy.
» Chemotherapy is an effective option for
treatment of lung cancer, lymphomas, and germ
cell tumors.[26]
» Thymomas that are resistant to chemotherapy
and radiation may require surgical resection and
SVC reconstruction (operative mortality rate of
5% and patency rate of 80% to 90%).[27]
» Selection of therapy will depend on the type
of malignancy, staging and histopathology.
See Small cell lung cancer , Non-small cell lung
cancer , Non-Hodgkin lymphoma , Thymic tumor
.
plus percutaneous endovascular stenting
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Endovascular stenting is performed to achieve
more rapid improvement in symptoms and has
fewer side effects compared with radiation
therapy.[23] [24] [25]
» Undertaken percutaneously by obtaining
access (usually) through the femoral vein.
Performed under conscious sedation.
Fluoroscopic guidance and iodinated contrast
are used and most operators use heparin during
the procedure.

Superior vena cava syndrome Management
MANAGEMENT
Ongoing
» Supportive treatment consists of diuretics, low-
salt diet, avoidance of upper-extremity lines,
head elevation, and oxygen.
» Type of diuretic will depend on several factors
including renal function and current or past
history of diuretic use.
infectious etiology
1st treatment of infection
» Underlying infection (e.g., aspergillosis,
blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, nocardiosis)
should be treated according to local sensitivities.
» Choice of antimicrobial will depend on the
underlying pathogen.
2nd palliative therapy
» Endovascular stents and more rarely bypass
surgery may be required if superior vena cava
obstruction persists after treatment of infection.
iatrogenic etiology
thrombosis due to central
venous catheter(s)
1st catheter removal + thrombolysis and/or
anticoagulation
» Catheter(s) should be removed and local
thrombolysis and/or short-course anticoagulation
should be considered in these patients.[29]
» Chronic warfarin therapy up to 1 year has been
described in some reports.[32] Dose should be
titrated to target INR of 2.0 to 3.0.
» Thrombolysis has higher success rates if used
within first 5 days of development of superior
vena cava obstruction.[28]
pacemaker and
implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator lead-related
venous occlusion
1st percutaneous balloon dilatation/stenting
with or without lead removal
» Percutaneous balloon dilatation/stenting is
preferred in these patients.
» Lead explantation may carry a high risk of
mortality (1% to 3%).[30] Bypass surgery may be
an option.
» Infection of the leads should always be
considered as a possibility and evaluated
with blood cultures and transesophageal
echocardiogram.
» Long-term anticoagulation with warfarin should
be considered. Dose should be titrated to target
INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

Superior vena cava syndrome Management
Primary prevention
The most important primary prevention measure is to avoid smoking, which increases the risk of malignant
causes of superior vena cava syndrome.
Patient discussions
Patients should be advised to monitor for symptoms of recurrence like upper-extremity swelling,
engorged neck veins, facial edema, or plethora. They should also be advised to report to the emergency
department if they develop dyspnea or confusion.

Superior vena cava syndrome Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients should be followed up regularly by their treating physician (i.e., oncologist/ surgeon/cardiologist/
radiation therapist). The duration, frequency of follow-up, and further workup generally depend on the
underlying etiology.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
percutaneous stenting procedural complications short term low
Procedural complications can include stent thrombosis or migration, dissection, perforation, bleeding,
infection, or cardiac tamponade.
May require percutaneous or surgical intervention.
There is a risk of volume overload or heart failure exacerbation immediately following revascularization due
to sudden increase in venous return.
thrombolysis/anticoagulation-related bleeding variable low
Minor or major bleeding complications can be related to systemic anticoagulation. They might necessitate
holding the anticoagulant regimen, or possibly giving an antidote.
Prognosis
Prognosis usually depends on the underlying etiology, with poorer prognosis for malignant conditions.
Malignant etiology
In patients with treatment-responsive malignancies, superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome does not
necessarily signify adverse outcomes. However, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer resistant to
chemotherapy and radiation therapy, development of SVC syndrome is associated with poor prognosis and
median survival of <6 months.[33]
Benign etiology
Patients treated for benign causes with stenting or surgery have patency rates of around 90%, though there
may be a need for recurrent stenting in some cases. Following percutaneous stenting, patients may need to
be on antiplatelet therapy or warfarin for 1 to 3 months, although there are no clear guidelines regarding the
duration of treatment.[22]

Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
