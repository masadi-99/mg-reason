Evaluation of dizziness Overview
Summary
Dizziness is the sensation of disturbed spatial orientation without a distorted sense of motion.[1] Patients
may use the term to indicate lightheadedness, imbalance (disequilibrium), presyncope, or vertigo. These
symptom types overlap substantially and patients most often report feeling off-balance or unsteady. Over
60% of patients experience more than one type of dizziness.[2]
Dizziness is a common symptom: the prevalence in the general population ranges from 15% to 30%, and
approaches 50% for patients aged over 85 years.[2] [3] [4] Dizziness accounts for approximately 5% of
emergency department and unselected outpatient visits and up to 8% of primary care visits.[4] [5]
The etiology is diverse and includes vestibular, cardiovascular, neurologic, and psychogenic causes.[6] A
detailed history, paying particular attention to timing and triggers of the patient’s symptoms, will narrow down
the differential diagnosis, which can be confirmed with clinical exam and, if needed, further investigations.

THEORY
Etiology
Dizziness has many possible etiologies. The most common are vestibular, cardiovascular, neurologic, and
psychogenic.[5]
Patients may use the term dizziness to describe vertigo, presyncope, lightheadedness, and imbalance
(disequilibrium). Vertigo is a sensation of distorted self-motion, occurring at rest or during an otherwise
normal head movement.[1] Vertigo usually indicates a problem with the peripheral (inner ear, vestibular
nerve) or central (brainstem, brain) vestibular system.[7] Imbalance may be neurologic in origin and
lightheadedness and presyncope may be cardiovascular in origin. Patients with psychogenic dizziness report
a variety of symptoms, such as rocking, floating, or swimming sensations.[3]
Symptoms may overlap substantially and patients most often report feeling off-balance or unsteady. Over
60% of patients experience more than one type of dizziness.[2] Evaluating the timing and triggers of dizzy
episodes can help the clinician make a correct diagnosis.[8]
Vestibular
• Benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV): the most common cause of vertigo, affecting 107 people
in 100,000 per year.[9] In the US, BPPV is diagnosed in 17% to 42% of patients presenting with
vertigo.[10] Prevalence increases with age and women are affected more frequently than men.[4] [11]
• BPPV is caused by loose otoconia particles (calcium carbonate crystals) in the semicircular
canals, usually the posterior canal.[10]
• Patients experience vertigo with changes in head position relative to gravity (e.g., rolling over in
bed or looking up).
• Torsional, upbeating nystagmus provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is diagnostic of
posterior semicircular canal BPPV.[10]
• Labyrinthitis: an acute bacterial or viral infection of the labyrinth of the inner ear. The patient often
presents after an upper respiratory infection or acute otitis media. Patients may have associated
symptoms of tinnitus and hearing loss, because the cochlea is located within the bony labyrinth.[12]
[13] Patients with acute otitis media may also report otalgia, otorrhea, and fever.[14]
• Vestibular neuritis (neuronitis): an acute peripheral neuropathy probably due to reactivation (e.g.,
herpes simplex virus), which affects the vestibular nerve. Patients present with acute onset vertigo
but do not have hearing loss or tinnitus. Changes in head position exacerbate symptoms and loss of
balance is a prominent feature.[12]
• Meniere disease: usually presents in middle-aged people, with fluctuating auditory and vestibular
symptoms. Prevalence estimates vary from around 3.5 per 100,000 to 200 per 100,000 adults.[15] [16]
[17] [18] The underlying cause remains unknown; hereditary factors are thought to play a role.[19]
• Classic Meniere disease has the triad of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Spontaneous vertigo
attacks last 20 minutes to 12 hours with documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural
hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. The
tinnitus is usually described as roaring in nature and may be severe. Aural fullness, a sensation
of pressure and fullness in the ear, may also be present during an episode.

Evaluation of dizziness Theory
• An atypical presentation of Meniere disease is fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus without
vertigo. This is usually referred to as cochlear hydrops, and up to 40% of patients will eventually
develop vertigo.[20]
• Bilateral disease may be present in around 30% to 50% of patients.[21] [22]
• Superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS): a vestibular disorder caused by a pathologic third
window into the labyrinth that can present with autophony, sound- or pressure-induced vertigo, and/or
altered middle-ear pressure, and chronic disequilibrium, among other vestibulocochlear symptoms.[23]
• Many patients with SCDS present after head trauma and are initially diagnosed with post-
traumatic vertigo, labyrinthine concussion, or perilymphatic fistula.
• Perilymphatic fistula: an abnormal communication between the perilymph-filled space of the inner ear
and an air-filled space in the middle ear, mastoid or cranium.[24] The fistula develops in the round
or oval window. It may occur after stapes surgery, head trauma or barotrauma. It is characterized by
episodic vertigo and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss.[24] 
• Cholesteatoma: a mass of keratinizing squamous epithelium within the middle ear or temporal bone.
Patients may present with vertigo.[25] Associated symptoms include otorrhea and hearing loss.[26]
• Previous mastoid surgery with a mastoid cavity: these patients are prone to dizziness with an ear
infection.
• Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD): a chronic vestibular disorder. It is one of the most
common types of chronic dizziness in people ages 30 to 50 years.[27] [28] [29] Five diagnostic criteria
must be satisfied to make the diagnosis:[30]
• one or more symptoms of dizziness, unsteadiness, or nonspinning vertigo present on most days
for ≥3 months
• persistent symptoms occurring without provocation but exacerbated by upright posture, active or
passive motion, or exposure to moving stimuli
• disorder precipitated by conditions that cause vertigo including acute, episodic, or chronic
vertigo or neurologic or medical illness, or psychological distress
• symptoms cause significant distress or functional impairment
• symptoms are not better accounted for by another disease or disorder.
Neurologic
• Vestibular migraine: one of the most common causes of vertigo and dizziness.[31] It often occurs in
patients in their 40s with a personal or family history of migraine.[32] [33]
• Associated symptoms include headache, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and fatigue.[31] 
Episodes last minutes to days.[7] [34] 
• Posterior fossa tumors: include vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuroma), meningiomas, cerebellar
or brainstem tumors, and epidermoid cysts. May cause hearing loss and/or cranial nerve palsies.
• Cerebellar disorders: the most common diagnoses are sporadic adult-onset degenerative ataxia
(26%); idiopathic down beating nystagmus syndrome (20%); cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and
vestibular areflexia syndrome (10%); episodic ataxia type 2 (7%); and multiple system atrophy
cerebellar type (6%).[35]
• Multiple sclerosis: vertigo is a common symptom. It may be peripheral (i.e., caused by involvement of
the vestibular apparatus of the ear), central (i.e., caused by lesions affecting the vestibular pathways),

or of combined etiology.[36] Prolonged spontaneous attacks of vertigo occur if a demyelinating
plaque occurs at the root entry zone of the vestibular nerve or nucleus, and this presents as an acute
peripheral vestibular disorder, such as vestibular neuritis.[3]
• Posterior circulation stroke: may be due to infarction or hemorrhage.[37]
• Symptoms are variable and often nonspecific, however dizziness is one of the most common
presenting symptoms. Vertigo is continuous and prolonged. Other common presenting
symptoms include unilateral limb weakness, dysarthria, headache, diplopia, nausea, and
vomiting.[7] [37] The presentation may be very similar to vestibular neuritis.
• Patients may have at least one vascular risk factor (age >60 years, hypertension, diabetes,
smoking, obesity).[7]
• Signs include nystagmus, unilateral limb weakness, gait ataxia, unilateral limb ataxia, dysarthria,
facial numbness, Horner syndrome, and diplopia.[7] [37] Patients usually cannot stand without
support, even with the eyes open, whereas patients with acute vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis
are usually able to do so.
• Lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg syndrome) is caused by occlusion of the ipsilateral
vertebral artery that supplies the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Patients have prolonged
vertigo lasting several days. Signs include: truncal ataxia, ipsilateral limb ataxia, diplopia,
multidirectional nystagmus, ipsilateral Horner syndrome ipsilateral facial pain, hoarseness,
dysphagia, and loss of pain and temperature sensation of the ipsilateral face and contralateral
trunk and limbs.[37] [38]
• Vertebrobasilar insufficiency: describes transient ischemia of the vertebrobasilar circulation. It is
the result of atherosclerosis and affects the territory supplied by the anterior inferior cerebellar
artery. Patients present with episodic vertigo, with diplopia, headaches, vomiting, ataxia, blindness,
imbalance, and bilateral weakness.[39] Patients may experience drop attacks, sudden falls secondary
to loss of limb tone without loss of consciousness. Episodes last between 30 seconds and 15 minutes
and typically start after abruptly standing or turning the head.[39] 
• Vertebral artery dissection: may be traumatic or spontaneous and is a cause of posterior circulation
stroke in young adults. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, tinnitus, and signs include ataxia
and dysarthria.[40] [41] Predisposing factors are hypertension, history of recent infection and certain
connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta,
and fibromuscular dysplasia).[42] [43]
• Arnold-Chiari malformation type 1: an abnormality of the base of the skull, associated with brain stem
and cerebellum herniation through the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. The most common
symptom is occipital headache. Other symptoms may include dizziness, unsteadiness, and hearing
loss.[44] Symptoms can mimic those of BPPV.[45] The condition might be asymptomatic.
• Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): characterized by raised intracranial
pressure that is not caused by a mass lesion; associated with headache and transient poor vision.
These patients are often obese and complain of clumsiness, imbalance, and dizziness rather than true
vertigo. Some patients present with bilateral sixth nerve palsy or tinnitus. Incidence is increasing with
the rise in obesity.[46]
• Normal pressure hydrocephalus: associated with normal intracranial pressure and enlarged ventricles
(hydrocephalus). Patients present with ataxia, urinary incontinence, and cognitive dysfunction.[47] The
diagnosis may be difficult to establish.
• Mal de debarquement syndrome: patients experience swinging, swaying, unsteadiness, and
disequilibrium after exposure to motion. There may be a history of a long voyage or air travel.

It is thought to be due to a conflict between the sensory inputs from the visual, vestibular, and
somatosensory systems and the central vestibular nuclei, cerebellum, and parietal cortex.
• Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration: a rare complication of cancer of the ovary, breast, or lung,
or of Hodgkin lymphoma. Autoantibodies are thought to be directed against Purkinje cells. The anti-
Yo antibody can present years before tumor detection. Anti-Tr antibody is associated with Hodgkin
lymphoma.
• Secondary syphilis: may present with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss or vertigo. Late neurosyphilis
may present with hearing loss, fluctuating hearing, or vestibular symptoms.[48]
Infectious
• Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): dizziness is a common symptom reported in approximately
7.2% of patients.[49] May be a direct consequence of the virus affecting vestibular function or an
indirect effect of hypoxia, dehydration, or fever.[50]
Cardiovascular
• Dizziness: may be associated with palpitations or provoked by exercise if there is a cardiovascular
cause.[51] Dizziness with a cardiovascular etiology may cause presyncope and/or vertigo.[52] Nearly
two thirds of of patients with cardiovascular causes of dizziness report vertigo, and vertigo is the
only type of dizziness described in 37% of these patients.[52] Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic
dizziness/vertigo requires:[53]
• ≥5 episodes of dizziness/vertigo that occur in an upright position, and improve on sitting or lying
down, AND
• hypotension, tachycardia, or syncope documented on standing or tilt-table test (definite
diagnosis), OR
• at least one of: generalized weakness/fatigue, poor concentration, blurred vision, and/or
palpitations (probable diagnosis), AND
• exclusion of other possible causes.
• Presyncope: lightheadedness without an illusion of movement. Symptoms may include generalized
weakness, giddiness, headache, blurred vision, loss of vision, paresthesia, nausea, vomiting and
diaphoresis. Symptoms last a few seconds to a few minutes. The patient senses an impending
loss of consciousness but recovers before losing consciousness.[54] The mechanism is almost
always a reduction in blood supply to the brain. The symptoms may be spontaneous, positional, or
associated with various triggers, depending on the cause.[3] Presyncope is the most common subtype
of dizziness in older people.[51]
• Orthostatic (or postural) hypotension: one of the most common causes of presyncope. Patients
complain of dizziness on standing.[55] The cause is impaired peripheral vasoconstriction and/or
a reduction in intravascular volume. It is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of
≥20 mmHg or a decrease in diastolic BP of ≥10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing.[56] One study
has suggested that BP should be tested within 1 minute of standing.[57] Orthostatic hypotension
may occur in patients who take antihypertensive medication or who are volume depleted. It may
be idiopathic or associated with autonomic dysfunction, such as in people with Parkinson disease,
multiple system atrophy, or diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Orthostatic hypotension is a recognized
complication after bariatric surgery.[58]

THEORY
• Arrhythmias, ischemia, structural heart disease, and pulmonary embolism: may cause presyncope.[54]
 One study of 881 patients who attended the emergency department complaining of presyncope found
that 5% had serious outcomes within 30 days of the index visit. Most patients with a cardiac cause
for presyncope were diagnosed at the initial emergency department visit. The most common cardiac
causes detected in this study were atrial fibrillation and sinus node dysfunction.[54] Other cardiac
causes of presyncope detected in the study population were: supraventricular tachycardia, complete
atrioventricular block, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, and structural
heart disease.[54] In one study of patients undergoing monitoring for recurrent unexplained syncope,
an arrhythmia was present in 25% of presyncopal events.[59]
• Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: the most common autonomic disorder in young people.
The patient has similar postural symptoms to people with orthostatic hypotension but with excessive
postural tachycardia. Patients commonly present with complaints of postural lightheadedness, or
dizziness. This is diagnosed by increased heart rate on standing, lack of orthostatic hypotension, and
the absence of other conditions, such as dehydration, a primary cardiac cause, an endocrine disorder,
or a nervous system disorder.[60]
Psychological
• Psychophysiological dizziness (mixed physiological and psychogenic etiology): may occur
spontaneously or after a labyrinthine disorder. Patients complain of a variety of symptoms, such as
rocking, floating, or swimming sensations. The symptoms may worsen with stress or fatigue.[3]
• Primary hyperventilation: alveolar ventilation in excess of metabolic requirements, leading to
decreased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Patients are usually young and female. Over
half have a comorbid psychiatric condition. Fear, paresthesia, and dizziness are the most common
symptoms.[61]
• Psychogenic dizziness: panic disorder with agoraphobia, personality disorders, or generalized anxiety
are often present in patients complaining of dizziness. If the dizziness is psychogenic, patients may
demonstrate inappropriate or excessive anxiety or fear. Phobic postural vertigo is characterized by
dizziness in standing and walking despite normal clinical balance tests. Patients may demonstrate
anxiety reactions and avoidance behavior to specific stimuli.[62]
• Phobic postural vertigo: characterized by dizziness in standing and walking despite normal clinical
balance tests. Patients may demonstrate anxiety reactions and avoidance behavior to specific
stimuli.[62]
Metabolic
• Diabetes mellitus: dizziness may be associated with episodes of hypoglycemia. Other features of
hypoglycemia include shakiness, sweating, irritability, confusion, tachycardia, and hunger.[63][64]
 Diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy may have more difficulty in recovering from a peripheral
vestibular disorder.[65]
Autoimmune
• Systemic lupus erythematosus: patients may complain of vertigo or hearing loss, and may have
abnormal nystagmography.[66] [67]
• Cogan syndrome: an inflammatory disorder resulting in interstitial keratitis and audiovestibular
dysfunction. The pathology involves plasma cell and lymphocyte infiltration of the spiral ligament,

endolymphatic hydrops, and degenerative disease of the organ of Corti. There is also demyelination of
the eighth cranial nerve and inner ear osteogenesis.[68]
• Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis): characterized by
granulomatous lesions of the upper respiratory tract, necrotizing vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis.[69]
• Behcet disease: a rare systemic autoimmune vasculitis, characterized by recurrent oral and genital
ulceration, ocular inflammation and skin lesions. 15% to 47% of patients with Behcet disease have
vestibular involvement. This may cause dizziness, nystagmus and high-frequency sensorineural
hearing loss.[70]
Drug-related
• Ototoxic drugs: aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin and neomycin are vestibulotoxic
and cochleotoxic.[71] Ototoxicity has been described for topical as well as parenteral use.[72]
Aminoglycosides may cause vertigo without causing hearing loss. Toxicity with parenteral use is
related to the total dose administered. Risk factors for aminoglycoside-related ototoxicity include:[73]
[74][75]
• duration of therapy >7 days
• prior exposure to aminoglycosides
• high dose
• age extremes (<5 years and >60 years)
• presence of specific mitochondrial DNA mutations (may account for up to 60% of
aminoglycoside ototoxicity)
• exposure to loud sounds
• renal dysfunction
• other ototoxic drugs (e.g., loop diuretics).
• Chemotherapeutic drugs: cisplatin, widely used in various soft-tissue neoplasms, may cause
sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.[76] The severity of the sensorineural hearing loss is related to
the cumulative dose.
• Alcohol: patients report feeling "high," dizzy, and intoxicated after ingestion.
• Antihypertensives, anesthetics, antiarrhythmics, drugs of misuse: may cause dizziness.
• Certain antiepileptic drugs (oxcarbazepine, topiramate): may increase the risk of balance
disorders.[77]
• Alpha-adrenoreceptor blockers, beta-blockers, nitrates, antipsychotics, opioids, antiparkinsonian
drugs, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors: associated with orthostatic hypotension.[78] [79]
Toxins
• Carbon monoxide poisoning: may be secondary to accidental exposure from residential boilers, central
heating systems, cookers, fireplaces, and chimneys. The symptoms are often nonspecific but may
include vertigo, headaches, impaired concentration, presyncope, tachycardia, or angina.[80]

Traumatic
• Post-traumatic vertigo: generally occurs as a result of blunt head trauma. Patients may present
with symptoms of BPPV, a traumatic perilymphatic fistula, post-traumatic Meniere disease, or post

sleep disturbance, impaired cognition, photophobia, and phonophobia.[82]

Urgent considerations
(See  Differentials  for more details)
Posterior circulation stroke
Posterior circulation stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) may present in a similar fashion to vestibular neuritis,
with sudden-onset intense vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.
Other presenting symptoms include unilateral limb weakness, dysarthria, headache, and diplopia.[7] [37]
Vertigo is continuous and prolonged. Patients may have at least one vascular risk factor (age >60 years,
hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity).[7]
Signs include nystagmus, unilateral limb weakness, gait ataxia, unilateral limb ataxia, dysarthria, facial
numbness, Horner syndrome, and diplopia.[37] Patients usually cannot stand without support, even with the
eyes open, whereas patients with acute vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis are usually able to do so.
The head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) assessment identifies stroke with a high degree
of sensitivity and specificity in patients with acute vestibular symptoms when administered by a health
professional with training and experience in its use. In this setting, it may rule out stroke more effectively than
early diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).[34] [83] However, HINTS assessment alone
does not reliably rule out stroke when used by emergency physicians.[84]
Based on the HINTS model, one algorithm suggests that stroke should be considered in patients presenting
with acute-onset dizziness if:[85]
• There is a central pattern of nystagmus
• There is skew deviation
• There is a negative head impulse test (in patients with nystagmus)
• There are any central nervous system signs on focused neurologic exam, or
• The patient is unable to sit or walk unaided.
Check capillary blood glucose in all patients with suspected stroke and arrange urgent neuroimaging.[86]
In most cases, a CT head without contrast is appropriate and readily accessible. This can detect acute
intracranial hemorrhage and large infarcts, and permits the clinician to assess the patient’s suitability for
thrombolysis.[86] [87] [88]
If the patient has had stroke symptoms for fewer than six hours, noncontrast CT is often performed first.[89]
 If the patient has had stroke symptoms for longer than six hours, MRI is recommended as the initial
investigation.[89] MRI can be performed without contrast for patients with renal failure or contrast allergy.[89]
MRI can determine the age of the infarct and evaluate other causes for the symptoms. It is more sensitive
than CT for acute infarct.[88] [89]
Vertebral artery dissection
Vertebral artery dissection may cause stroke in children and young adults. May be traumatic or spontaneous.
Symptoms are sudden-onset vertigo, headache (often unilateral), tinnitus, and neck pain.[41][90] Neurologic
signs may be absent but, if present, include ataxia and dysarthria.[40]
CT imaging and angiography (CT/CTA) and MRI and angiography (MRI/MRA) can identify cervical artery
dissection. MRI/MRA better identifies small intramural hematomas, however CT is usually easier to access

in the emergency setting.[91] Ultrasound may be considered as a follow-up investigation to assess arterial
remodeling.[41] Digital subtraction angiography may be considered as a second-line imaging technique in
patients with clinical symptoms and negative MRA and CTA.[41]
Anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment should be started after confirming the diagnosis.[92]
[93] Intravascular therapy is available in some centers. A combination of techniques including thrombolysis,
thrombectomy, stenting, and angioplasty is used.[94] 
Acute coronary syndrome
Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) commonly report feeling dizzy/lightheaded; this is due to
cerebral hypoperfusion as a result of hypotension and/or symptomatic bradycardia. Typical cardiac chest
pain is a retrosternal sensation of pain, pressure, or heaviness radiating to the left arm, both arms, right
arm, neck, or jaw, which may be intermittent or persistent. Immediate investigations include a 12-lead ECG,
chest x-ray, cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitivity cardiac troponins), complete blood count, and renal profile.
Guidelines recommend that oxygen should not be routinely administered in normoxic patients with suspected
or confirmed ACS.[95] [96]
• Unstable angina (UA): UA is characterized by specific clinical findings of prolonged (>20 minutes)
angina at rest; new onset of severe angina; angina that is increasing in frequency, longer in duration,
or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a recent episode of myocardial infarction.[97] The
ECG may be normal or may show ST-segment depression, transient ST-segment elevation, or T-wave
inversion.[97] Cardiac biomarkers should be measured on presentation to rule out acute myocardial
infarction; subsequent/serial measurements may be needed.[97] [98] The early management of
patients with suspected UA is focused on initial interventions (e.g., single loading dose of aspirin and
pain relief with glyceryl trinitrate) and triage according to the presumptive diagnosis.
• Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): initial ECG may show ischemic changes such as
ST depression, T-wave changes, or transient ST elevation; however, ECG may also be normal or show
nonspecific changes. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are elevated (>99th percentile of normal) at
presentation or after several hours.[99] Treatment is directed toward relief of ischemia, prevention
of further thrombosis or embolism, and stabilization of hemodynamic status, followed by early risk
stratification for further treatment.
• ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): suspected when a patient presents with persistent ST-
segment elevation in two or more anatomically contiguous ECG leads in the context of a consistent
clinical history.[100] Cardiac biomarkers are elevated. Treatment should, however, be started
immediately in patients with a typical history and ECG changes, without waiting for laboratory results.
Immediate and prompt reperfusion can prevent or minimize myocardial damage and improve the
chances of survival and recovery.[101]
Arrhythmias
• Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate causing ongoing chest pain, hypotension, shortness
of breath, dizziness, or syncope requires immediate direct current (DC) cardioversion. To prevent
thromboembolism, anticoagulation should be started before cardioversion and continued for at least 4
weeks afterwards without interruption.[102]
• Bradycardia associated with hemodynamic compromise (i.e., systemic hypotension, signs of cerebral
hypoperfusion, progressive heart failure or angina) should be treated immediately, regardless of the

cause. The most common medications used to increase ventricular rate are intravenous atropine
and epinephrine (adrenaline). Medical therapy should be continued until temporary cardiac pacing is
initiated.[103]
Pulmonary embolus
Typically presents with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Six percent of patients with pulmonary
embolus (PE) present with syncope or presyncope.[104] Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography
(CTPA) is the best investigation for diagnosing and excluding PE; echocardiography is an alternative if CTPA
is not immediately available or if the patient is too unwell to be moved.[104] In patients with suspected PE
who are hemodynamically unstable and/or hypoxic, thrombolysis (unless contraindicated) should be started
without delay.[104] Give high-concentration oxygen if oxygen saturations are <90%.[104] Titrate oxygen to
achieve saturations of 94% to 98% (or 88% to 92% in patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure).[105]
Carbon monoxide poisoning
Accidental poisoning can occur as a result of exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless, odorless gas
generated from burning fuel. Sources include boilers, central heating systems, cookers, fireplaces, and
chimneys. CO levels may rise if the outlet for these systems becomes blocked or if they are operated in an
unventilated environment.[106]
Diagnosis of CO poisoning rests on a high index of clinical suspicion as symptoms vary and are mostly
nonspecific.[107] Symptoms include dizziness, vertigo, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, fatigue,
chest pain, and shortness of breath.[108]
Physical examination may be normal. Signs are usually a consequence of hypoxia, and patients may present
with tachycardia, hypotension, cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias, cutaneous blisters, and pulmonary edema. 
See Carbon monoxide poisoning .
Elevated carboxyhemoglobin, measured using a CO oximeter, confirms the diagnosis. Normal levels are 1%
to 3% in nonsmokers and up to 10% in smokers.[108]
High-flow oxygen therapy should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is considered, and should not be

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
Approach
The history should include a description of the typical attacks, including their nature, duration, triggers and
associated auditory symptoms (e.g., hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure).
The exam should include otoscopy, eye exam, central nervous system exam, and specific tests depending on
the patient's presentation.
The diagnosis of dizziness is usually made on the basis of the history and exam only. Investigations may not
be necessary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and internal auditory meatus may be helpful
to detect neurologic pathology. Vestibular function tests are indicated in some cases. Tests of cardiovascular
function are necessary if a cardiovascular cause is suspected.
History: characteristics of the current episode
The traditional approach to assessment is to classify the type of dizziness, with vertigo indicating a vestibular
cause, disequilibrium a neurologic cause and presyncope a cardiovascular cause.[109] However, symptom
types overlap substantially and patients most often report feeling off-balance or unsteady. Over 60% of
patients experience more than one type of dizziness.[2] Nearly two thirds of of patients with cardiovascular
causes of dizziness also report vertigo, and vertigo is the only type of dizziness described in 37% of these
patients.[52]
An initial approach that considers trigger (positional or not) and timing (episodic or continuous) may be
more useful as a first step than classifying the symptoms according to type (true vertigo, presyncope, or
dysequilibrium).[109] [110]
Duration of each episode of vertigo
• Seconds: may be due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)[12]
• Seconds to minutes: may be due to labyrinthitis or vestibular neuronitis[12]
• Hours: may be due to Meniere disease[12]
• Months: persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) symptoms last for 3 months or more.[111]
Check for triggers
• Vertigo associated with BPPV occurs on head movement (e.g., bending down or looking up quickly)
and is relieved by keeping the head still. Ask about turning or laying down in bed; vertiginous attacks
triggered by turning or laying down in bed, together with dizziness lasting less than one minute, may
help identify BPPV.[112]
• In labyrinthitis, symptoms are exacerbated by head movement, but are also present at rest.
• PPPD symptoms are exacerbated by being upright, active or passive motion independent of direction
or position, and complex or moving visual stimuli. Triggered by conditions that cause vestibular
symptoms or affect balance, including neuro-otologic illness and psychological distress.[111]
• Dizziness on getting up quickly may be associated with orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome, and presyncope.[113]
• Mild attacks of vertebrobasilar insufficiency may be associated with orthostatic hypotension.
• People with autonomic dysregulation present with dizziness on standing upright for prolonged periods,
swimming, or running.
• Vertigo induced by loud sounds or coughing may be due to semicircular canal dehiscence.

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
"TiTrATE" is an acronym for "timing, triggers, and a targeted examination." The authors of the acronym
consider new onset vertigo as one of four distinct clinical syndromes, defined according to timing and
triggers.
• Timing refers to the onset, duration, and evolution of the dizziness. Triggers are actions, movements,
or situations that provoke the onset of dizziness in patients who have intermittent symptoms.
• These syndromes are:
• Triggered episodic vestibular syndrome (e.g., BPPV, orthostatic hypotension)
• Discrete episodes of dizziness lasting seconds
• Precipitated by a specific action or event
• Recommended examination includes Dix-Hallpike test (see below), lying and standing
blood pressure
• Spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome (e.g., vestibular migraine, panic attacks, Meniere
disease, cardiac arrhythmia)
• Discrete episodes of dizziness lasting minutes to hours[15]
• Most events have no clear trigger
• Diagnosis made from history
• Post-exposure acute vestibular syndrome (e.g., head injury, aminoglycoside exposure)
• Persistent dizziness lasting days to weeks
• History of trauma or toxin exposure
• Diagnosis made from history
• Spontaneous acute vestibular syndrome (e.g., vestibular neuritis, posterior circulation stroke)
• Persistent dizziness lasting days to weeks
• Associated nausea, nystagmus, gait unsteadiness and head motion intolerance
• Recommended examination includes the head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS)
assessment.[8]
Presence of other otologic symptoms
• Hearing loss may occur in Meniere disease, labyrinthitis, posterior fossa tumors, cholesteatoma,
superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SCDS), and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known
as Wegener's granulomatosis).
• Tinnitus may occur in Meniere disease, labyrinthitis, posterior fossa tumors and cholesteatoma.[114]
• Aural fullness occurs in Meniere disease.
• Hyperacusis to bone-conducted sounds and autophony may occur in semicircular canal dehiscence.
• Fever, otalgia, and otorrhea may occur in acute otitis media associated with labyrinthitis.
• Malodorous ear discharge occurs in cholesteatoma.
Determine how the episodes began
• Patients with a preceding upper respiratory infection may have viral neuritis or labyrinthitis.[115]
• Patients with a history of sea, air, or train travel prior to the onset of symptoms and with symptoms
occurring on disembarking may have mal de debarquement syndrome.[116]

DIAGNOSIS
• Patients with a history of trauma or barotraumas (e.g., scuba divers or pilots) may have a perilymphatic
fistula.[24]
Ask about other more general symptoms associated with the vertigo
• The phrase "Dangerous Ds" can be a useful reminder of some of the red-flag symptoms that indicate a
serious central cause for vertigo. These are:
• Diplopia
• Dysarthria
• Dysmetria
• Dysphagia
• Dysphonia[8]
• Associated chest pain, exertional presyncope, and dyspnea suggest a cardiovascular etiology.[117]
• Nausea is often associated with peripheral vestibular disorders as a part of the autonomic response.
• Vestibular migraine may be associated with aura, visual disturbance, photophobia, or phonophobia,
with or without headaches.[118]
• Posterior fossa tumors may cause headache.[114]
• Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension are often obese and may complain of clumsiness,
imbalance, headache and transient poor vision.
• Patients with Cogan syndrome have ocular symptoms including photophobia, ocular discomfort and
redness.[119]
• Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) may
present with nasal crusting, ulceration or epistaxis.
• Recurrent genital and oral ulceration and uveitis occur in Behcet disease.
Psychiatric symptoms
• Panic disorder with agoraphobia, personality disorders, or generalized anxiety is often present in
patients complaining of dizziness. One study of 40 patients reported that an anxious, introverted
temperament was strongly associated with chronic, subjective dizziness.[120]
• If the dizziness is psychogenic, patients may describe symptoms of excessive anxiety or fear. A
hospital and anxiety depression scale of >8 is diagnostic.[121]
• Phobic postural vertigo is characterized by dizziness on standing and walking, despite normal clinical
balance tests.
• Patients may describe avoidance behavior to specific stimuli.[62]
• Patients with psychophysiological dizziness may describe an initial labyrinthine disorder with persisting
symptoms.
History: identification of cause
History of trauma or surgery
• Dizziness may be a complication of stapedectomy and cochlear implantation.[122] [123]
• Patients who have had previous mastoid surgery with a mastoid cavity are prone to dizziness with ear
infections.
• A perilymphatic fistula may occur after stapes surgery, head trauma or barotrauma.[24]

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
• Post-traumatic vertigo generally occurs as a result of blunt head trauma. Patients may present with
symptoms of BPPV, a traumatic perilymphatic fistula or post-traumatic Meniere disease.[81] Vertigo
can also occur as part of a post concussion syndrome.
• Patients with SCDS may present after head trauma.
• Orthostatic hypotension is a recognized complication after bariatric surgery.[58]
History of other medical illnesses
• Diabetes mellitus may be associated with attacks of dizziness related to hypoglycemic episodes.[65]
• Systemic lupus erythematosus may also be associated with dizziness.[66] [67]
• Dizziness occurs as an initial symptom in 5% of people with multiple sclerosis and occurs in 50% of
patients at some point during the disease.[3]
• Patients with a history of migraine are more likely to have migraine-associated vertigo.[118]
• A history of certain connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome,
osteogenesis imperfecta, and fibromuscular dysplasia predispose patients to cervical artery
dissection. Hypertension, recent infection, or trauma are also predisposing factors.[42] [43]
Family history of illness
• There may be a family history of migraine.
Known or contact with infectious disease
• Secondary syphilis may present with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss or vertigo. Patients with
otosyphilis often present with vertigo. Late neurosyphilis may present with hearing loss, fluctuating
hearing, or vestibular symptoms.[68]
• Audiovestibular symptoms (including sensorineural hearing loss) may be caused by reactivation of
latent HSV-1 infection, and may be preceded by herpetic skin lesions.[68]
• COVID-19 infection is associated with dizziness.[49] [124] [125] [126]
Medication and drug history, and possible toxin exposure
• Drugs associated with ototoxicity (e.g., aminoglycoside antibiotics), particularly if these have been
administered concomitantly with loop diuretics or aspirin, and chemotherapeutic agents (e.g.,
cisplatin).
• Anesthetic medication, antiarrhythmic medication, and drugs of misuse may cause patients to feel
dizzy.
• Oxcarbazepine and topiramate increase the risk of balance disorders.[77]
• Drugs associated with orthostatic hypotension: antihypertensive medication, alpha-blockers,
beta-blockers, nitrates, antipsychotics, opioids, antiparkinsonian drugs, and phosphodiesterase
inhibitors.[78] [79] [127]
• Alcohol intoxication can cause dizziness.
• Accidental exposure to faulty or inadequately vented residential boilers, central heating systems,
cookers, fireplaces, and chimneys may cause carbon monoxide poisoning.
Risk factors for cardiovascular disease or stroke
• Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and obesity.[3] [7]

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is a rare complication of cancer of the ovary, breast, or lung, or
of Hodgkin lymphoma.[3] [128]
Physical exam: HINTS
HINTS is a set of three examinations: the head impulse test, characterization of spontaneous nystagmus,
and test of skew. It can be performed quickly at the bedside and does not require any equipment.[129] It is
a sensitive test for stroke in patients who have symptoms suggesting a vestibular cause of dizziness (e.g.,
vertigo, nausea or vomiting, unsteady gait, head-motion intolerance, nystagmus) and who have one or more
risk factors for stroke.[83] HINTS has been found to identify stroke with a high degree of sensitivity and
specificity in patients with acute vestibular symptoms if a healthcare professional with training and experience
in the use of this test is available, and may rule out stroke more effectively than early diffusion-weighted
MRI.[34] [83] However, HINTS assessment alone does not reliably rule out stroke when used by emergency
physicians.[84]
Head impulse test
• The examiner turns the patient's head as rapidly as possible 15 degrees to one side and observes
the patient's ability to keep fixating on a distant target. With a peripheral vestibular lesion, a saccade
occurs as the vestibulo-ocular reflex fails, the patient cannot keep focusing on the target, and a catch-
up movement occurs. After a cerebellar stroke, no catch-up saccade occurs: the head impulse test is
negative.

Head impulse test. A: The right ear has intact peripheral vestibular function. When the head
is turned to the right, the vestibulo-ocular reflex moves the eyes to maintain visual fixation. B:
The right ear now has impaired vestibular function. When the head is turned to the right, the
eyes move with it, breaking visual fixation, and a refixation saccade is seen as the eyes dart
back to the examiner's face. This indicates a peripheral vestibular disorder on the right side

Characterization of spontaneous nystagmus
• In vestibular neuritis, spontaneous nystagmus is torsional to horizontal and beating away from the side
of the lesion. The nystagmus typically increases on looking toward the direction of the nystagmus, and
decreases on looking away from the direction of the nystagmus (Alexander’s law).[109]
• A central vestibular lesion produces vertical, bidirectional or pure rotatory nystagmus.
• In bidirectional nystagmus, the fast phase is to the left when the patient looks to the left, and to the
right when the patient looks to the right.
• Both vestibular neuritis and central causes of vertigo can cause spontaneous horizontal nystagmus
and gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus.
Test of skew
• Skew deviation is vertical ocular misalignment resulting from a right-left imbalance of vestibular tone
• Perform an alternating cover test by asking the patient to fix on a target (such as your nose), then
cover and uncover each eye in turn.
• If the eyes are misaligned, after uncovering the affected eye it will move to refocus on the target. This
is a positive result.
• If the eye does not move after it is uncovered, this is normal. This is a negative test of skew.
Based on the HINTS model, one algorithm suggests that stroke should be considered in patients presenting
with acute-onset dizziness if:[85]
• There is a central pattern of nystagmus
• There is skew deviation
• There is a negative head impulse test (in patients with nystagmus)
• There are any central nervous system signs on focused neurologic exam, or
• The patient is unable to sit or walk unaided.
In the absence of these symptoms, patients in the accident and emergency department setting may be
treated as having vestibular neuritis.[85]
Physical exam: ear
Ear exam
• The tympanic membrane in acute otitis media is erythematous, opaque, and bulging.

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• People with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) may have
signs of serous otitis media or chronic otitis media.
Tuning fork tests
• Used to determine whether hearing loss is conductive or sensorineural.
• Weber’s test: a 512-Hz tuning fork is placed on the forehead or maxillary teeth, and the patient is
asked to state in which ear the sound is louder. The sound will be perceived in the affected ear when
a unilateral conductive hearing loss is present or in the unaffected ear when there is a unilateral
sensorineural hearing loss.
• Rinne's testing allows the examiner to determine whether any hearing loss is secondary to middle ear
(conductive hearing loss) or inner ear/eighth cranial nerve (sensorineural hearing loss) causes. The
base of a 512-Hz tuning fork is placed on the mastoid and the patient indicates when he or she no
longer hears the sound. Once the sound is no longer audible, the tuning fork is placed in front of the
ear and the patient is asked whether he or she hears the sound. If the sound is louder when the tuning
fork is on the mastoid, then the patient has a conductive hearing loss. If the sound is louder with the
fork in front of the ear, hearing loss is sensorineural or normal. The result of this test is combined with
the result of the Weber test to interpret the type of hearing loss.
The fistula test
• Performed by applying pressure on the tragus to occlude the ear, or by pneumatic otoscopy (exerting
pressure on each ear canal with a rubber bulb attached to an auriscope), thereby putting pressure on
the middle ear.
• A positive result of induced dizziness and nystagmus occurs with SCDS, postsurgical dizziness, or
perilymphatic fistula.
• Fistula test may be positive in people with cholesteatoma.
• A positive fistula test provides support for doing a temporal bone computed tomography (CT).
Physical exam: eye
Observation of eye movements
• Ophthalmoplegia with palsies of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI may occur with multiple sclerosis or with an
intracranial lesion.[3]
• Neurologic signs such as diplopia, disconjugate gaze, Horner syndrome, and gait ataxia are in keeping
with a central lesion.
• The presence of nystagmus may indicate peripheral or central pathology.
• A central vestibular lesion produces vertical, bidirectional, or pure rotatory nystagmus.
• Abnormal saccades and smooth pursuit may also indicate central pathology such as cerebellar
disorders.
• Sound- or pressure-induced nystagmus in the plane of the semicircular canal (positive Tullio and
Hennebert tests) are a key finding in patients with SCDS.[23]
Fundoscopy
• Papilledema may be present in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)

Exam of dynamic visual acuity
• This tests the vestibulo-ocular reflex by observing the effect of head rotation on visual acuity (e.g., by
reading the letters on a Snellen chart).[115]
• Abnormal results indicate a bilateral vestibular failure.
Observation of the eyes may lead to suspicion for other ophthalmological conditions, such as interstitial
keratitis in Cogan syndrome or uveitis in Behcet disease.
Physical exam: clinical balance tests
The Dix-Hallpike test
• This is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of posterior canal BPPV.[10]
• The test is performed with the patient sitting the upright on a bed; for the right side, the examiner
stands on the patient’s right side, rotates the patient’s head 45 degrees to the right, and then moves
the patient, whose eyes are open, to the supine right-ear down position, and then extends the patient’s
neck slightly so that the chin points slightly upward. Patient's symptoms are noted and any nystagmus
is observed. The test is repeated on the left with the examiner standing on the patient’s left side.[10]

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Classically, the onset of peripheral nystagmus and symptoms is delayed by about 5 to 20 seconds.
The provoked vertigo and nystagmus increase then resolve within 60 seconds.[10] The nystagmus
fatigues on repeat testing, although this is not recommended because it unnecessarily subjects
patients to further symptoms.[10]
• BPPV is typically due to posterior canal pathology. If the pathology affects the horizontal canal, the
nystagmus may be more persistent and less fatigable.
• When symptoms are due to central pathology, the test causes nystagmus that is not fatigable, is down-
beating, and is associated with minimal vertigo.
• The Dix-Hallpike test has been shown to have a positive predictive value of 83% and a negative
predictive value of 52% for the diagnosis of BPPV.[132]

positional vertigo (BPPV). CMAJ. 2003 Sep 30;169(7):681-93; used with permission
Supine lateral head turns
• If the Dix-Hallpike test is negative in a patient who has a history suggestive of BPPV, perform supine
lateral head turns to test for lateral semicircular canal BPPV.[10] Position the patient supine with the
head in the neutral position, then quickly rotate the head 90 degrees to one side while observing the
patient’s eyes for nystagmus. The head is returned to the face up position, allowing all dizziness and
nystagmus to subside; the head is then turned rapidly to the opposite side.[10]
• In most cases of lateral semicircular canal BPPV, there is intense horizontal nystagmus beating toward
the undermost (affected) ear when the patient is rolled to the affected side. When the patient is rolled
to the unaffected side, there is less intense horizontal nystagmus beating toward the undermost
ear.[10]
Physical exam: central nervous system
Exam of the other cranial nerves
• Facial nerve palsy may occur with cerebellopontine angle tumors, granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis) and cholesteatoma.

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
• Dysarthria can be a sign of posterior circulation stroke, vertebrobasilar insufficiency or vertebral artery
dissection.
• Facial numbness may occur in posterior circulation stroke.
• Loss of pain and temperature sensation of the ipsilateral face occurs in Wallenberg syndrome (lateral
medullary infarction).[38]
Neurologic exam
• Exam of cerebellar function is usually tested with the finger-to-nose test and rapid alternating hand
movements.[131] This may be abnormal in cerebellar lesions. 
• Ipsilateral limb ataxia and loss of pain and temperature sensation of the contralateral trunk occurs in
Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary infarction).[38]
• Various neurologic signs may be present in people with multiple sclerosis (e.g., altered gait, weakness,
nystagmus, cranial nerve palsies).
• Signs of peripheral neuropathy may occur in patients with diabetes mellitus (e.g., numbness and
presence of painless injuries).
• Bizarre changes (e.g., "wooden soldier" or "scissor gait") may occur in psychogenic lesions.
Romberg and Unterberger (Fukuda) tests
• Provides information about the patient's balance with the eyes closed.
• Romberg test: the patient attempts to maintain a standing position with the feet together, eyes closed,
and arms outstretched. The test is positive if the patient cannot maintain balance.
• Unterberger test: the patient performs stationary stepping with eyes closed for up to 1 minute. A
tendency to veer toward the affected side occurs after a unilateral vestibular loss.
• These are nonspecific tests that can be abnormal in peripheral or central lesions.[115]
• Patients with cerebellar infarction usually cannot stand without support, even with the eyes open,
whereas a patient with acute vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can.
Physical exam: cardiovascular system and general exam
Cardiovascular exam
• Check for an irregular pulse, which could indicate an arrhythmia.
• Check lying and standing blood pressure (BP) and pulse should be checked in patients with postural
symptoms. A fall in systolic BP of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of at least 10 mmHg within 3
minutes of standing indicates orthostatic hypotension.[56] 
• Where postural symptoms resemble those of orthostatic hypotension, but orthostatic hypotension is
not demonstrated, an increased heart rate on standing may indicate postural orthostatic tachycardia
syndrome.[60]
• Auscultate for carotid bruits and cardiac murmurs.
General exam may reveal evidence of other conditions (e.g., oral ulcers with Behcet disease; evidence of
multisystem involvement with systemic lupus erythematosus).
Investigations: pure-tone audiogram
• Demonstrates any associated hearing loss.
• A unilateral sensorineural hearing loss may occur in labyrinthitis and Meniere disease (low frequency).

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Unilateral or asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss should prompt investigation for a posterior fossa
tumor (e.g., acoustic neuroma).[114]
Investigations: imaging of the head
CT scan of the petrous temporal bones
• A high-resolution thin-slice CT scan is useful in patients with suspected SCDS.[88] [133]
• Useful in the diagnosis of middle ear or mastoid disease. May be helpful to confirm
cholesteatoma.[134]
• Should be performed if temporal bone fracture is suspected.[135]
CT scan of the brain
• Usual initial imaging investigation for patients with suspected acute stroke if the patient has had
symptoms for fewer than six hours. Noncontrast CT detects intracranial hemorrhage and large infarcts,
allowing the treating clinician to make management decisions quickly.[86] [89]
• The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend that all patients
admitted to hospital with suspected acute stroke should have brain imaging on arrival to hospital and
in most cases, noncontrast CT will provide the necessary information to make decisions about acute
management.[86]
• The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK advises that patients with suspected
acute stroke should have brain imaging with a noncontrast CT within one hour if any of the following
apply:[87]
• Indications for thrombolysis or thrombectomy
• On anticoagulant treatment
• Known bleeding tendency
• Glasgow Coma Score below 13
• Unexplained progressive or fluctuating symptoms
• Papilledema, neck stiffness, or fever
• Severe headache at onset of stroke symptoms
MRI of internal auditory meatus and brain
• Contrast-enhanced MRI with MR angiography is recommended for patients who have a suspected
acute stroke. MRI can determine the age of the infarct and evaluate other causes for the symptoms.
It is more sensitive than CT for acute infarct.[88] [89] If the patient has had stroke symptoms for less
than six hours, noncontrast CT is often performed first.[89] If the patient has had stroke symptoms
for longer than six hours, MRI is recommended as the initial investigation.[89] MRI can be performed
without contrast for patients with renal failure or contrast allergy.[89]
• Contrast-enhanced MRI is the investigation of choice for suspected posterior fossa tumors.[134]
• Demonstrates malformations (e.g., Arnold-Chiari malformation type 1).
• Demyelinating lesions may be seen on MRI in people with multiple sclerosis.
• Advances in MRI techniques enable visualization of endolymphatic hydrops.[136]
• MRI angiography may be performed in cases of suspected vertebrobasilar insufficiency
(demonstrating occlusion of the cerebellar arteries), Wallenberg syndrome (demonstrating occlusion of
the ipsilateral vertebral artery), or vertebral artery dissection.

There are numerous tests available, such as electronystagmography (ENG), caloric testing, video head
impulse test (vHIT), and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials.
• The tests can be useful in cases of diagnostic uncertainty to demonstrate a unilateral or bilateral
vestibular loss.
• Typically, a directional preponderance (nystagmus greater in one direction than the other) of 26% to
30% indicates significant asymmetry, and a canal paresis (reduced function) of 22% to 25% indicates
a unilateral vestibular loss.[115]
• Computerized dynamic posturography testing: utilizes a computerized controlled platform and visual
booth to evaluate sensory and motor components of balance.[131] The test results in 6 abnormal
sensory patterns useful for clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation.
• Rotatory chair testing: an adjunctive balance test that may be used if ENG is abnormal.
• Electrocochleography: may be useful in the diagnosis of Meniere disease. The transtympanic test
is a more invasive type of electrocochleography and is a more sensitive test than extra-tympanic
electrocochleography.
• Acoustic reflex assessment: involves exposing the patient to loud noise to observe the muscle that
causes movement of the stapes to protect the ear. It is a secondary assessment of stapes function and
would be abnormal in people with otosclerosis (pathological temporal bone remodeling) and normal in
people with SCDS.
• vHIT: this tests the vestibulo-ocular reflex of all the semicircular canals.[137]
• Vestibular evoked myogenic potential: indicated only when SCDS is suspected.[138] In this case,
increased amplitude may be demonstrated.[133]
Investigations: cardiovascular
ECG
• Recommended in patients when a cardiac cause of dizziness is suspected.
Echocardiography
• May be useful for patients with syncope where cardiac pathology is suspected.[139]
Cardiac monitoring
• Indicated in patients with presyncope where an arrhythmia is suspected.
Tilt-table testing
• Done in cases where orthostatic hypotension or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is
suspected, or there is a possibility of autonomic dysregulation.[60] [139][140]
• Symptoms are provoked on testing.
Further investigations in specific circumstances
• Antinuclear antibodies, double-stranded DNA, Smith antigen if systemic lupus erythematosus is
suspected.[141]
• Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and biopsy of lesions for histology if granulomatosis with
polyangiitis [formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis] is suspected.

Evaluation of dizziness Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
• Treponemal antibody tests if syphilis infection is suspected.
• Blood glucose monitoring and HbA1c in patients with diabetes mellitus who have dizzy episodes
possibly related to hypoglycemia. A lower than expected HbA1c is suggestive but not diagnostic of
hypoglycemic episodes. Self-monitored blood glucose levels are required for confirmation.
• Blood glucose must be checked in all patients with a suspected stroke.[86]
• Assess carboxyhemoglobin levels using a carbon monoxide oximeter in cases of suspected carbon
monoxide poisoning.[108]
• Serum drug levels may be appropriate if the symptoms are thought to be medication- or drug-related.
Slit-lamp ophthalmoscopic exam
• Necessary if the diagnosis of Cogan syndrome is considered.
Exploratory tympanotomy
• May be done to investigate the cause of postsurgical dizziness or when there is a suspected diagnosis
of perilymphatic fistula.
Lumbar puncture and measurement of CSF pressure
• Required to diagnose benign intracranial hypertension and normal pressure hydrocephalus.
Cisternography
• Performed to demonstrate the absence of obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct or of CSF outflow from
the 4th ventricle in people with normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Figure 1: Head impulse test. A: The right ear has intact peripheral vestibular function. When the head is
turned to the right, the vestibulo-ocular reflex moves the eyes to maintain visual fixation. B: The right ear
now has impaired vestibular function. When the head is turned to the right, the eyes move with it, breaking
visual fixation, and a refixation saccade is seen as the eyes dart back to the examiner's face. This indicates a
peripheral vestibular disorder on the right side

BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
