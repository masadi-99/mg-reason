Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Overview
Summary
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is usually asymptomatic, although brief palpitations may
sometimes be experienced. Symptoms in a patient with known NSVT are most often attributed to underlying
cardiac disease rather than the arrhythmia itself.
Defined as a self-terminating event. No specific treatment indicated. Management is directed at any
underlying heart condition.
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement may be used for selected patients who have additional
risk factors such as structural heart disease. Patients at risk for sudden cardiac death and who also have
discordant contraction of left ventricular function may benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy.
Prognosis dependent on presence or absence of cardiac disease. Left ventricular function in post-myocardial
infarction patients remains the most important prognostic tool for overall mortality and risk for sudden cardiac
death.
No increase in mortality demonstrated in those patients without associated cardiac disease.
Definition
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is an ectopic ventricular rhythm with wide QRS complex (≥120
milliseconds), rate faster than 100 bpm, lasting for at least 3 beats that spontaneously resolves in less
than 30 seconds.[1] [2] It may occur in the absence of any underlying heart disease. However, it is more
commonly associated with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease; known genetic disorders (e.g., long QT
syndrome, Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy); congenital heart disease;
metabolic problems including drug toxicity; or electrolyte imbalance.[3]

THEORY
Epidemiology
The estimated incidence of NSVT in the general population (both with and without heart disease) is as high
as 4%, although this is most likely an underestimate. The prevalence of NSVT becomes more common
as age increases.[7] [8] There do not appear to be any sex-specific differences in the incidence of NSVT.
However, men are probably more likely to be affected simply due to a higher incidence of coronary artery
disease. The advent of thrombolytic therapy has decreased the overall prevalence of NSVT in patients after
myocardial infarction from a range of 12% to 25%, down to 5% to 9%. However, this prevalence varies with
left ventricular dysfunction. NSVT has been observed in 12% of patients with ejection fraction (EF) less than
35%, compared with 6% in patients with EF greater than 35%. Using 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring,
NSVT has been observed in 25% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and up to 80% of patients
with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.[9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
Etiology
NSVT is most commonly observed in patients with underlying ischemic or nonischemic cardiac disease;
although it may also be observed in apparently healthy people.[14] [15] [16] [17] Incidental NSVT is a
common finding in routine cardiologic investigation (e.g., when investigating noncardiac disease, before
participating in sports, before cancer treatments), as well as during routine monitoring (e.g., during
anesthesia or sedation).[2]
While ischemic cardiac disease is still the most common etiology of NSVT, especially in high-income
countries, infectious diseases such as Chagas disease in Central America and other forms of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy also contribute to the etiology of NSVT around the world.[18]
Structural heart diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, congenital
heart disease, and valvular heart disease are also associated with NSVT.[19] [20] [21]
Abnormalities of multiple cellular proteins such as sodium and potassium channels (the long QT syndrome,
Brugada syndrome), intracellular calcium channels (catecholaminergic polymorphic VT), sarcomere proteins
(hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and cellular architecture proteins (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) have all
been associated with NSVT.[22] [23]
Electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) often incite and/or contribute
to NSVT. In addition, certain drugs have the ability to prolong the QT interval, which can promote NSVT
(macrolide antibiotics, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol). While antiarrhythmic drugs, such as digoxin,
flecainide, sotalol, and dofetilide, are used to treat atrial arrhythmias, they can produce unwanted ventricular
arrhythmias, an effect referred to as proarrhythmia.
Family history of sudden death before 50 years of age (especially in a first-degree relative) is associated
with an increased risk of both sustained and nonsustained VTs. Stress, either mental or physical, may trigger
NSVT in patients with long QT syndrome, catecholamine-sensitive VT, and certain idiopathic VTs arising
from the ventricular outflow tracts.
Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes
breathing) is associated with various cardiac arrhythmias.[24] Epidemiologic studies show that patients with
SDB have a two-fold higher odds of NSVT.[24]

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Theory
Pathophysiology
Similar to other tachyarrhythmias, NSVT can be due to increased automaticity, triggered activity or re-
entry. Patients with compromised myocardium secondary to prior myocardial infarction or nonischemic
cardiomyopathy have been identified as having regions of slowed conduction adjacent to damaged
myocardium or scar tissue. It is within these areas that re-entrant arrhythmias originate.[1] [13] In apparently
healthy people, repetitive monomorphic VT most commonly arises from the right ventricular outflow tract.[25]
This is usually a result of delayed afterdepolarizations (triggered activity) due to reactivation of sodium and
calcium ion channels.
Classification
Variants
Exercise-induced NSVT:
• Observed in patients during stress testing.[4]
Repetitive monomorphic VT:
• Ectopic arrhythmia characterized by short bursts of NSVT with an organized, regular, single-
morphology QRS complex
• Arising most commonly from the right ventricular outflow tract, but may also originate from the left
ventricular outflow tract and other ventricular sites.[5]
Nonsustained polymorphic VT:
• Ectopic arrhythmia characterized by NSVT with multiple different wide (≥120 milliseconds) QRS
complex morphologies arising from the ventricle.[6]
Case history
Case history #1
A 65-year-old obese man presents with a crushing substernal chest pain for the past 3 hours and is
hospitalized for an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. His medical history includes hypertension and
hyperlipidemia. He is also a smoker. Primary angioplasty reveals an occluded right coronary artery, which
is successfully stented. He is found to have a left ventricular function of 45% with reduced contractility
(hypokinesis) of the inferior wall. On the third day of hospitalization, telemetry reveals a 5-beat run of wide
QRS complexes with a rate of 136 bpm. The patient is asymptomatic during this event.
Case history #2
A previously well 45-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 3-week history of progressive shortness
of breath. He is able to perform activities of daily living independently but becomes short of breath with
mild to moderate exertion. Echocardiogram reveals a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrates normal coronary arteries. A 24-hour ambulatory ECG shows
several episodes of NSVT.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Diagnosis
Approach
NSVT is defined as an ectopic ventricular rhythm on ECG consisting of 3 or more consecutive, wide (duration
≥120 milliseconds) QRS complexes with a heart rate greater than 100 bpm, spontaneously resolving in
less than 30 seconds.[1] [2] Once the presence of an NSVT is established, the main goals are to identify
any existing cardiac pathology and to risk stratify patients with known cardiac disease for appropriate
management and therapy.
Evaluation of nonsustained wide QRS tachycardia
Created by BMJ Knowledge Centre.
NSVT is usually asymptomatic on presentation, and symptoms such as palpitations and syncope overlap
greatly with other pathologies and tachyarrhythmias. Therefore, further investigation is required to identify
the specific etiology of NSVT.[2] It is appropriate to begin with a complete history and physical exam followed
by ECG. Laboratory studies and echocardiography may also be useful in the initial workup of the patient.
More expensive and invasive testing such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiac catheterization
should be ordered in the appropriate clinical setting after initial evaluation has been completed.

DIAGNOSIS
History
NSVT has been identified in a wide spectrum of patients, from those with no identifiable cardiac condition
to patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiac disease. Therefore, it is important to assess the
patient's risk factors in light of NSVT that would prompt further testing and/or therapy.
History that places patients at higher risk:
• Nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35% and New York
Heart Association class II or III symptoms
• Ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF <35%
• Ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF <40% with NSVT and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT)
during electrophysiologic testing
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with personal history of cardiac arrest or sustained VT, first-
degree relative with sudden death, unexplained exertional or recurrent syncope, left ventricular
septum thickness greater than 30 mm, or frequent or prolonged NSVT
• Congenital arrhythmia syndromes such as long QT and Brugada syndromes.[31]
Family history of structural heart disease, electrical disease, and cardiomyopathy should be assessed.[2]
 In addition, the patient should be questioned regarding the use of any potentially arrhythmogenic
medication (e.g., macrolide antibiotics, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, digoxin, flecainide, sotalol, and
dofetilide). Family history of cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death may be of significance. The
physician should also enquire about the presence of any current mental or physical stress that may have
triggered the arrhythmia. Patients may complain of syncope as a result of hypotension due to the NSVT or
an underlying cardiac condition. Dizziness, lightheadedness, and presyncope may occur if cerebral blood
flow is compromised. Syncope suspected to be of cardiac origin is a high-risk symptom that may require
rapid hospital admission for further investigation.[2]
Physical exam
This should focus on possible signs for occult or worsening cardiac disease in patients with no known
cardiac condition or patients with known cardiac disease, respectively.
Palpation of peripheral pulses provides information on heart rate, identifying a current tachycardia and
in combination with peripheral BP monitoring can suggest the status of the patient's cardiac output. The
presence of rales on chest exam or the presence of peripheral edema may be a sign of elevated left
or right atrial pressures associated with cardiac dysfunction. Similarly, palpation of the heart for left or
right ventricular heaves and examination of the neck for elevated jugular venous pressure should be
performed. Careful auscultation for pathologic cardiac murmurs or abnormal heart sounds (S3 or S4) may
assist in prompting further workup for ischemic and nonischemic cardiac disease.
ECG
NSVT is diagnosed based on the following specific ECG findings: a ventricular rhythm with wide (≥120
milliseconds) QRS complex; and a rate faster than 100 bpm lasting for at least 3 beats that spontaneously
resolves in less than 30 seconds.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
From the collection of Dr F. Kusumoto; used with permission
A 24-hour ambulatory ECG may be necessary to detect the NSVT, determine the extent of the arrhythmia
burden and/or analyze the QT interval (can be identified using a standard 12-lead ECG, although at times
temporally dynamic changes in the QT interval require more prolonged monitoring periods such as a 24-
hour ambulatory monitor). Using at least 3 leads on the Holter may help estimate whether the NSVT/
premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are uni- or multifocal, and show their site of origin.[2] More
recently, consumer wearable devices that may identify arrhythmias, including NSVT, have been used by
patients. While the quality of the recordings from these devices has improved dramatically, particularly in
identifying atrial fibrillation and identification and assessment of burden of ventricular arrhythmias, medical
grade ECG recording devices provide more detailed and clinically actionable information.[32]
It is important to differentiate between a wide complex tachycardia originating from the ventricles and one
that is supraventricular, as the medical management differs.
Evidence supporting the diagnosis of a VT includes:
• Baseline ECG tachycardia with morphology similar to that of PVCs
• Initiation of the tachycardia with a PVC making NSVT more likely

• LBBB: may be a sign of structural heart disease, including Chagas disease or dilated
cardiomyopathy
• T-wave inversion: although nonspecific, may be an important marker of underlying structural
cardiac disease.
The morphology of the NSVT can give clues to its cause, with typical monomorphic VT suggesting an
idiopathic cause with good outcome.[2] Some morphologies are particularly concerning. For example,
longer bursts of polymorphic VT, particularly those with rapid rates (shorter duration [cycle length]
between QRS complexes), or short-coupled PVCs that initiate NS polymorphic VT or monomorphic
NSVT with short cycle length can indicate patients at higher risk of sudden cardiac death. These patients
may need to be admitted for further assessment.[2] The evidence for the prognostic value of the NSVT
duration (e.g., 6 beats vs. 25 beats) has been mixed, however, as a general rule longer episodes raise
more concern than shorter episodes (<3-5 beats).
Electrolytes and cardiac biomarkers
Electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia, can often trigger
and/or contribute to NSVT, and therefore any blood electrolyte abnormality must be identified.[2] Clinical
suspicion for ischemia should prompt testing of myocardial biomarker assays (CK-MB and troponin I), as
they provide useful confirmatory information regarding myocardial infarction (MI).
Echocardiogram, stress test, cardiac catheterization, or MRI
Investigation for underlying cardiac disease is facilitated by several diagnostic tests.
• Echocardiography is a safe and inexpensive tool to evaluate for structural cardiac abnormalities,
such as valvular heart disease, which in advanced stages can cause NSVT and is treatable.

DIAGNOSIS
Echocardiography is also useful to quantify systolic function and detect the presence of an
underlying cardiomyopathy.[2]
• Stress testing and/or cardiac catheterization is useful in establishing the presence of CAD
in patients who have risk factors for CAD but may be asymptomatic. The patient's pretest
probability of CAD should be scored and used to guide the choice of investigations. An exercise
stress test can identify exercise-induced arrhythmias, and, if present, may indicate underlying
structural heart disease. Patients may need to be advised to avoid exercise until they have
undergone further investigation and treatment.[2] Often, stress testing with imaging (e.g., nuclear or
echocardiography) is required for more definitive identification of the underlying ischemia.
• Cardiac MRI with gadolinium may be useful for identifying myocardial scarring associated with
CAD, dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy, and HCM. It also confirms the presence of fibrofatty
infiltrates in the ventricle, and measures right ventricular dysfunction in patients with suspected
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Guidelines recommend considering a cardiac MRI
in patients with newly documented NSVT and suspected structural heart disease (other than CAD)
after initial evaluation.[2]
Electrophysiologic testing
Consultation with an electrophysiologist is essential to determining which patients would benefit from
an invasive electrophysiologic (EP) test, implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement, and medical
treatment optimization.[1] EP testing can be useful for evaluation (and treatment) in a wide range of
patients after MI, including those with inducible VT and ejection fraction (EF) less than 40%, and those
with EF less than 30% to 35% without inducible VT, especially if QRS is prolonged.[31] [34] In patients
with symptomatic NSVT (dizziness, syncope) that arises from the outflow tract, EP testing and ablation is
an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool.
Genetic screening
Genetic screening is available for common mutations associated with long QT syndrome, Brugada
syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, as well as HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy.
Consultation with a cardiologist or a medical geneticist may be helpful in determining which patients
would benefit the most from genetic screening. Cascade genetic testing of family members may be
warranted.[2] [23] [35] [36] [37]
History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
history of coronary artery disease (common)
• Causes myocardial oxygen deprivation, which can lead to infarction and scarring. Both areas of acute
and chronic ischemia are sources of delayed and aberrant electrical conduction and promote re-
entrant arrhythmias.
history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (common)
• Genetic disorder resulting in myocardial cell disorganization and asymmetrical thickening of the
ventricle. Both the phenotypic expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the risk of ventricular
arrhythmia vary among patients.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Diagnosis
history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (common)
• Compromised ventricular function from areas of fibrosis scar formation in the heart increases risk of
arrhythmias.
presence of other known causes (common)
• Including left ventricular systolic dysfunction, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, drug toxicity,
Chagas disease, and other cardiomyopathies.
asymptomatic presentation (common)
• In the vast majority of cases, NSVT is asymptomatic, most likely due to its brief duration.
tachycardia (common)
• Not always present at time of clinical exam, as NSVT last <30 seconds.
Other diagnostic factors
palpitations (uncommon)
• Brief palpitations secondary to increased heart rate may be experienced.
dizziness (uncommon)
• Suggests diminished cerebral blood flow.
lightheadedness (uncommon)
• Suggests diminished cerebral blood flow.
presyncope (uncommon)
• May be experienced by patients if perfusion to brain is compromised.
syncope (uncommon)
• May be experienced by patients if they become hypotensive due to NSVT. Recent syncope due to a
suspected cardiac cause is a high-risk symptom that may require inpatient investigation.[2]
Risk factors
Strong
coronary artery disease
• Causes oxygen deprivation, and eventually leads to infarction and ventricular scarring. Delayed
electrical conduction can occur as a result. Re-entrant arrhythmias originate within these areas.[1]
left ventricular systolic dysfunction
• Strong association between ventricular arrhythmias and systolic dysfunction. Scars formed by
ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy are areas of slowed electrical conduction and facilitate re-
entrant VTs.[1] [13]

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Genetic disorder resulting in myocardial cell disorganization and asymmetrical thickening of the
ventricle. Both the phenotypic expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the risk of ventricular
arrhythmia vary among patients.[26]
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
• Prevalence of NSVT in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is as high as 80%.[27] While there are many
causes for this condition, up to 40% are familial, most attributed to mutations in cardiac sarcomeric or
architectural proteins.[19] [28] [29]
long QT syndrome
• Patients with this relatively rare genetic disorder have prolonged QT interval (>440 milliseconds)
on ECG and are at increased risk of developing torsades de pointes (a polymorphic VT). Clinical
manifestations depend on phenotypic manifestation of the particular underlying genetic defect. At least
12 subtypes of long QT (LQT) syndrome have been identified, most commonly types 1 to 3. Patients
with LQT1 (potassium-channel defect) are at increased risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias
during periods of physical exertion. LQT2 (potassium-channel defect) is characterized by initiation of
ventricular arrhythmias following a startle reflex or a period of heightened emotional stress. Patients
with LQT3 (sodium-channel defect) tend to develop arrhythmias during sleep.[22] [23] [27]
Brugada syndrome
• A disorder of myocardial sodium channels, which leads to characteristic J point elevation and
downward-sloping ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads, and increased risk of sudden
death due to polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation.
electrolyte imbalance
• Electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia) often incite
and/or contribute to NSVT.
drug toxicity
• Certain drugs can prolong the QT interval, which can promote NSVT. These include macrolide
antibiotics, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol. Antiarrhythmic drugs, such as digoxin, flecainide,
sotalol, and dofetilide, used to treat atrial arrhythmias can produce unwanted ventricular arrhythmias
(proarrhythmia).
Chagas disease and other cardiomyopathies
• Especially in developing countries, infectious diseases such as Chagas disease in Central America
and other forms of cardiomyopathy (e.g., arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) also
contribute to the etiology of NSVT.[18]
sleep-disordered breathing
• Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea
(CSA), and Cheyne-Stokes breathing, is associated with a two-fold higher odds of NSVT.[24] In
patients with heart failure, OSA and CSA predict sleep-specific lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias
(VTA).[24] Screening and diagnostic testing for SDB and nocturnal hypoxia should be considered
for patients with VTA.[24] Small trials suggest that treating OSA is associated with reduced VTA,

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Diagnosis
particularly in heart failure patients; however, larger trials are required to assess whether treating OSA
is beneficial.[24]
Weak
catecholaminergic polymorphic VT
• Rare genetic condition that can cause syncope and result in sudden death. Mainly affects young
children.
family history of sudden death
• Especially in a first-degree relative, family history of sudden death before 50 years of age should
prompt search for potential arrhythmogenic causes. Genetic screening is available for common
mutations associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome and
catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.
mental or physical stress
• Stress, either mental or physical, may trigger arrhythmias in patients with long QT syndrome type 1,
catecholamine-sensitive VT, and certain idiopathic VTs arising from the ventricular outflow tracts. Most
likely due to effects of increased sympathetic activation on ventricular myocardium.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Management
Approach
NSVT is by definition a self-terminating event, and therefore usually no specific treatment is indicated.
Rather, treatment is directed at any existing heart condition. Patients with underlying cardiac disease may
need more aggressive therapy due to increased mortality risk. In contrast, no increase in mortality has been
demonstrated in those patients without an associated cardiac condition; therefore, reassurance is usually
sufficient.
In asymptomatic patients, if investigations show that the NSVT is likely to be idiopathic (right ventricular
outflow tract or fascicular origin, negative family history, normal 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram), and the
NSVT/premature ventricular contraction (PVC) burden is less than 10%, the patient can be discharged and
re-evaluated if they experience new symptoms or changes in their clinical condition.[2]

Modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease should be addressed to prevent myocardial infarction
(MI) and left ventricular dysfunction. Necessary medical therapy depending on the underlying condition
should be undertaken first before more aggressive treatment such as an implantable device is considered. It

MANAGEMENT
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), the guideline for the prevention of sudden cardiac death due to
ventricular arrhythmias was developed jointly by European and US professional cardiology groups.[1]
Symptomatic NSVT or >10% asymptomatic NSVT/PVC burden
On the rare occasion that NSVT produces symptoms in the absence of cardiac disease, medication
or catheter ablation may be required.[2] Symptom correlation with the NSVT is necessary and usually
accomplished by ambulatory ECG monitoring. Medical treatment options for symptomatic or high-
burden NSVT include beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers (usually used when beta-blockers
are contraindicated, e.g., asthma) as first-line therapy.[2] Catheter ablation may be considered early in
the treatment course and has a high success rate, particularly with right ventricular outflow tract and
fascicular origin NSVT, where it is recommended as first-line treatment.[2] Antiarrhythmics such as
flecainide or propafenone may be used in patients who fail therapy with beta-blockers and/or calcium-
channel blockers who are not candidates for catheter ablation or in whom catheter ablation is ineffective.
Amiodarone should only be used if ablation or other medications fail or cannot be used, due to its
toxicity.[2]
The far more common clinical scenario requiring treatment is when NSVT is associated with a high
burden of PVCs, and reduced left ventricular function is present. Frequent ventricular ectopy (NSVT
and PVCs) can sometimes be a causal factor for reduced left ventricular function, or an important
contributor.[39] The reasons for this are multifactorial but dyssynchronous left ventricular depolarization is
an important mechanistic cause. Although a 10% PVC burden is often used clinically as the percentage
of ventricular ectopy that may lead to left ventricular dysfunction, it is important to know that the burden
of ventricular ectopy can have temporal variability, and extended monitoring may be required.[40] As
a corollary, many patients with a PVC burden >10% will not develop left ventricular dysfunction, and
in 44% of patients, PVCs will spontaneously resolve at 1 to 2 year follow-up, so treatment to reduce
PVC burden should only be considered in an asymptomatic patient if left ventricular dysfunction is
present.[41] However, in the setting of left ventricular dysfunction and persistent PVC burden >10%
despite treatment of reversible conditions, a trial of antiarrhythmic drugs, or referral for catheter ablation,
should be considered to determine whether left ventricular function improves with reduction in PVC
burden.[1]
Electrolyte disturbances
Electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia, may trigger
NSVT in patients with or without cardiac disease. These disturbances should be corrected as efficiently
as possible.
Chronic coronary artery disease (CAD)
Patients with NSVT and CAD, combined with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
(≤40%), are at high risk of death from cardiac causes.[1] [42] In these patients, medical therapy should
be optimized and modifiable risk factors should be addressed, including weight management, physical
activity, and smoking cessation. Electrophysiologic testing is indicated for risk stratification. In patients
with sustained inducible VT, ICD implantation has been shown to reduce the risk of death and cardiac
arrest independently of New York Heart Association class.[1][2] [42]
Post-MI
Early reperfusion decreases overall prevalence of NSVT following acute MI.[9] Optimization of medical
therapy including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, antiplatelet therapy, and statins, reduces the risk of

sudden cardiac death following acute MI.[43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] In patients who have symptomatic
NSVT following MI, amiodarone may be beneficial in reducing risk of sudden cardiac death.[50] However,
several randomized trials have found that amiodarone is not associated with improved clinical outcomes.
In addition, the many adverse effects associated with amiodarone limit its use in many clinical situations;
therefore it is generally not used.
Modifiable risk factors such as obesity and smoking should also be addressed with a carefully planned
exercise, diet, and weight loss program to further reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death.[51] [52]
ICD is recommended for patients after MI with NSVT, ejection fraction (EF) ≤40% and inducible
ventricular arrhythmias at electrophysiologic testing.[53] Routine early use of ICD is not
recommended.[54]
Heart failure after MI
Medications such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and aldosterone receptor antagonists reduce overall
mortality and incidence of sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure.[48] [55] [56] [57] Diuretics
have no effect on mortality and are usually indicated to help relieve symptoms of fluid overload.
ICD is recommended for patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with class II/III heart failure, LVEF
≤35%, and who have a reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for >1 year.[58] ICD is similarly
indicated in patients with class I heart failure if LVEF is ≤30%.[58] Comorbid conditions that may attenuate
the survival benefit of ICDs include chronic kidney disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and
elevated BUN (27 to 50 mg/dL). It is important to note that the decision to implant an ICD is based on
cardiac function and symptoms rather than the presence or absence of NSVT.[53]
In some patients with heart failure, particularly those at risk for sudden cardiac death and who also have
discordant contraction of left ventricular function, a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device can
be used, usually in combination with an ICD (CRT-D).[59] The CRT device is designed to improve cardiac
function by providing more coordinated contraction of the left ventricle. However, frequent episodes of
NSVT or frequent PVCs can interfere with the normal function of the device.
Idiopathic or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
ICD placement is recommended for patients with underlying idiopathic cardiomyopathy plus LVEF ≤35%
and class II/III heart failure.[1] ICD is not indicated for patients with NSVT and idiopathic cardiomyopathy
with good left ventricular function.
European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that ICD placement be considered in patients with
NSVT and cardiomyopathy who meet the following criteria:[2]
• Dilated cardiomyopathy/hypokinetic nondilated cardiomyopathy, a pathogenic mutation in the LMNA
gene, and a 5-year estimated risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia of ≥10%.
• Symptomatic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and moderate right ventricle (<40%)
and/or left ventricle (<45%) dysfunction.
NSVT is found on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring in 20% to 25% of patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (HCM), and is associated with increasing left ventricular wall thickness and late
gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The relationship between NSVT and
HCM prognosis is not yet clear.[2]

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Management
MANAGEMENT
ICD placement should be considered for patients with HCM who have one of the major risk factors
for sudden cardiac death. Risk factors include sudden cardiac arrest, spontaneous sustained VT,
unexplained syncope, family history of sudden cardiac death in a first-degree relative, ventricular septal
wall thickness greater than 30 mm, NSVT on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, and hypotension in
response to exercise. Other risk factors include atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction, a high-risk mutation, and patients who compete in high-intensity physical
exercises.[1] [2]
If patients have an identified genetic mutation but there are no overt signs of the disease and no risk
factors for sudden cardiac death, close observation is sufficient; activity restrictions are not required.[60]

implant an ICD is based on cardiac function and
symptoms rather than the presence or absence
of NSVT.[53]
» In some patients with heart failure, particularly
those at risk for sudden cardiac death and
who also have discordant contraction of left
ventricular function, a cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT) device can be used, usually in
combination with an ICD (CRT-D).[59] The CRT
device is designed to improve cardiac function
by providing more coordinated contraction of
the left ventricle. However, frequent episodes
of NSVT or frequent premature ventricular
contractions can interfere with the normal
function of the device.

Primary prevention
Primary prevention is best accomplished by addressing risk factors for conditions that predispose to NSVT
such as coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Hypertension and
hyperlipidemia should be managed aggressively and smoking cessation should be strongly pursued. Regular

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Management
MANAGEMENT
physical activity may reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by 11% to 22%.[30] Additional preventive
measures include treatment of systolic dysfunction with medications such as ACE inhibitors/angiotensin
receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists.
Patients with diagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic
right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, and long QT syndrome should avoid strenuous physical
exertion, as exercise can provoke NSVT (or other arrhythmias) in these populations.
A prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be considered for patients at risk for sudden
cardiac death due to sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Although the presence of NSVT may be a useful risk
factor for estimating risk in certain conditions, generally the decision on whether an ICD is implanted is based
on multiple considerations such as age, family history, the presence of symptoms such as syncope, and the
extent of structural heart disease present.
Secondary prevention
Patient compliance with medications prescribed for treatment of the underlying cardiac disease is essential.
Factors that may trigger episodes of arrhythmia should also be avoided (e.g., mental or physical stress, or
electrolyte imbalance). It is useful to note that caffeine has not been demonstrated to alter the inducibility or
severity of ventricular arrhythmias.[75]
Patient discussions
The importance of medication compliance should be stressed. Patients should be advised to contact their
physician if they begin to experience palpitations, presyncope, syncope, or chest pains. These symptoms
may indicate worsening of the underlying cardiac disease or increased frequency of arrhythmia.
Side effects of medications used to treat an associated cardiac condition should be reviewed with
the patient. Patients should be instructed to alert their physician concerning implantable cardioverter
defibrillator shocks or evidence of device infection (erythema, tenderness, or drainage from the device
site).
In addition, patients should be advised to avoid factors that may trigger episodes of arrhythmia such as
mental or physical stress and dehydration (may cause electrolyte abnormalities). It is useful to mention
that caffeine has not been demonstrated to alter the inducibility or severity of ventricular arrhythmias.[75]

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients should routinely visit their physician. If appropriate, medical and/or implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) therapy should be initiated and maintained as clinically indicated based on the
underlying cardiac disease. Certain drugs may require specific follow-up to monitor for effectiveness and/
or toxicity (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, flecainide, and propafenone).
A cardiologist should also evaluate the patient for potential treatment options and risk stratification as the
natural course of the underlying cardiac disease progresses. Although patients implanted with ICDs can
be routinely checked by remote telemetry every 3 months, if the device delivers a shock or the patient
experiences tachycardia, immediate follow-up should be arranged.
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
sudden cardiac death variable low
Patients with increased risk include those with left ventricular dysfunction, history of MI, spontaneous
sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), unexplained syncope, family history of sudden cardiac death,
left ventricular thickness >30 mm or abnormal exercise BP. Appropriate treatment of underlying cardiac
disease including medical management, early reperfusion after MI, and implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) may be helpful in decreasing incidence.
cardiomyopathy variable low
Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy can occur in the setting of frequent or incessant NSVT episodes.
This complication may be reversed through medical management with medications and/or catheter
ablation.[70] [71] [72] [73]
ICD-related infection variable low
Most often arises from a bacterial infection along the intravascular portion of the leads or in the generator
pocket. May also be due to a bloodstream infection arising from a distant infectious focus or bacterial
entry via the skin, mouth, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract. Gram-positive bacteria are most commonly
implicated, particularly  Staphylococcus aureus . Patients at greatest risk include those with diabetes, skin
disorders, end-stage renal disease, and those taking oral anticoagulants. Removal of the ICD system and
a course of antibiotics are usually required for treatment.[74]
ventricular fibrillation variable low
Re-entrant rhythms near scar tissue may result in sustained VT, which can subsequently progress to
ventricular fibrillation, which has a high mortality rate.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardias Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Prognosis
The significance and prognosis of NSVT in patients is highly dependent on presence and severity of
underlying cardiac disease. In patients without evidence of ischemia or structural heart disease, NSVT has
not been found to adversely influence prognosis.[14] [15] Meanwhile, patients with ischemic or nonischemic
cardiac disease may require lifelong medical therapy with medications, catheter ablation, and/or implantable
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement.
Exercise-induced NSVT
In asymptomatic, apparently healthy people, NSVT observed during exercise was previously thought to be
a normal response to exertion, but some studies suggest that it may predict coronary artery disease.[4] In
addition, exercise-induced NSVT should arouse suspicion for the presence of a significant problem such as
catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
NSVT in apparently healthy people
Most commonly, the tachycardia originates from the right ventricular outflow tract and may cause symptoms
including palpitations and presyncope, but the risk of death is very low.[25] [69] Tachycardia-induced
cardiomyopathy can occur in the setting of frequent or incessant NSVT episodes. Genetic arrhythmias and
occult cardiomyopathy may appear later in life, and long-term follow-up may be indicated.
Ischemic and nonischemic NSVT
In the setting of known cardiac disease, prognosis is based on risk stratification with extent of left ventricular
dysfunction playing a pivotal role. Early reperfusion in the setting of myocardial infarction decreases the
overall prevalence of NSVT, and in high-risk patients who meet accepted criteria, ICD implantation allows for
continuous monitoring and long-term therapy, with evidence suggesting decreased risk of mortality.[9] [10]

DISCLAIMER
Disclaimer
BMJ Best Practice is intended for licensed medical professionals. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (BMJ) does not
advocate or endorse the use of any drug or therapy contained within this publication nor does it diagnose
patients. As a medical professional you retain full responsibility for the care and treatment of your patients
and you should use your own clinical judgement and expertise when using this product.
This content is not intended to cover all possible diagnosis methods, treatments, follow up, drugs and any
contraindications or side effects. In addition, since such standards and practices in medicine change as
new data become available, you should consult a variety of sources. We strongly recommend that you
independently verify specified diagnosis, treatments and follow-up and ensure it is appropriate for your
patient within your region. In addition, with respect to prescription medication, you are advised to check the
product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in
dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the drug to be administered is new, infrequently used, or
has a narrow therapeutic range. You must always check that drugs referenced are licensed for the specified
use and at the specified doses in your region.
Information included in BMJ Best Practice is provided on an “as is” basis without any representations,
conditions or warranties that it is accurate and up to date. BMJ and its licensors and licensees assume no
responsibility for any aspect of treatment administered to any patients with the aid of this information. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, BMJ and its licensors and licensees shall not incur any liability, including
without limitation, liability for damages, arising from the content. All conditions, warranties and other terms
which might otherwise be implied by the law including, without limitation, the warranties of satisfactory
quality, fitness for a particular purpose, use of reasonable care and skill and non-infringement of proprietary
rights are excluded.
Where BMJ Best Practice has been translated into a language other than English, BMJ does not warrant the
accuracy and reliability of the translations or the content provided by third parties (including but not limited to
local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages). BMJ is not responsible for
any errors and omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise.Where BMJ Best Practice lists
drug names, it does so by recommended International Nonproprietary Names (rINNs) only. It is possible that
certain drug formularies might refer to the same drugs using different names.
Please note that recommended formulations and doses may differ between drug databases drug names and
brands, drug formularies, or locations. A local drug formulary should always be consulted for full prescribing
information.
Treatment recommendations in BMJ Best Practice are specific to patient groups. Care is advised when
selecting the integrated drug formulary as some treatment recommendations are for adults only, and external
links to a paediatric formulary do not necessarily advocate use in children (and vice-versa). Always check
that you have selected the correct drug formulary for your patient.
Where your version of BMJ Best Practice does not integrate with a local drug formulary, you should consult
a local pharmaceutical database for comprehensive drug information including contraindications, drug
interactions, and alternative dosing before prescribing.
Interpretation of numbers
Regardless of the language in which the content is displayed, numerals are displayed according to the
original English-language numerical separator standard. For example 4 digit numbers shall not include a
comma nor a decimal point; numbers of 5 or more digits shall include commas; and numbers stated to be
less than 1 shall be depicted using decimal points. See Figure 1 below for an explanatory table.
BMJ accepts no responsibility for misinterpretation of numbers which comply with this stated numerical
separator standard.
This approach is in line with the guidance of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures Service.
