Pericarditis Overview
Summary
Pericarditis symptoms include sharp, severe retrosternal chest pain worse with inspiration and a supine
position.
The classic physical finding is a pericardial friction rub. A low-grade fever may be present.
Diagnostic signs include widespread electrocardiographic ST elevation or PR depression and a new or
worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiography; blood tests generally suggest systemic inflammation.
Treatment is directed at any underlying systemic disorder. Idiopathic or viral pericarditis responds to
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine.
Complications include chronic recurrent pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis.
Definition
Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium. The acute form is defined as new-onset inflammation
lasting <4-6 weeks. It is characterized clinically by a triad of chest pain, pericardial friction rub, and serial
electrocardiographic changes. A pericardial effusion may or may not be present. Pericarditis is the most
common disease of the pericardium encountered in clinical practice.[1]

Pericarditis Theory
THEORY
Epidemiology
Acute pericarditis is more common in adults (typically between 20 to 50 years old) and in men.[15] It is the
most common disease of the pericardium encountered in clinical practice. The true incidence and prevalence
are unknown and there are a large number of undiagnosed cases. Pericarditis may account for up to 5% of
presentations to emergency departments for chest pain and up to 0.1% of hospital admissions.[16] [17] [18]
Risk factors
Strong
male sex
Acute pericarditis is described more commonly in men, particularly in the viral form in which there is a
3:1 male-to-female ratio.[15]
age 20 to 50 years
The disorder is more commonly described in adults ages 20 to 50 years.[15]
transmural myocardial infarction (MI)
Two forms of pericarditis following MI exist: "early" (pericarditis epistenocardica) and
"delayed" (Dressler syndrome).[28] [29] The early form is caused by local inflammation at the
epicardial MI border with direct exudation. It occurs in 5% to 20% of transmural MIs, but is not often
recognized clinically. The delayed form occurs from 1 week to several months postinfarction and does
not require a transmural infarction. Its incidence is 0.5% to 5% (and <0.5% in patients treated with
thrombolytics). The incidence of pericarditis following transmural MI has declined since the use of
thrombolytics and myocardial revascularization.
cardiac surgery
Postpericardiotomy syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of cases 4 weeks after coronary
artery bypass grafting. It develops days to months postoperatively. Compared with the postinfarction
syndrome, there is a greater antiheart antibody response (antisarcolemmal and antifibrillatory) with
higher release of antigens.[1] [13]
neoplasm
Pericarditis generally results from local tumor invasion, lymphatic spread or hematogenous spread of a
malignant neoplasm. Primary malignant pericardial disease is rare.[2] [13]
viral and bacterial infections
Viral pericarditis is the most common pericardial infection.[1] [13] The inflammation is due to direct
viral attack and/or an immune response (antiviral or anticardiac). Onset is frequently postviral, with no
evidence of virus present in the pericardium.
Purulent pericarditis caused by bacterial pathogens occurs in 5% of cases. Pericardial infection can
occur by hematogenous spread or by direct extension from adjacent organs, notably the lungs and/or
pleural space.
In developed countries, 4% of acute pericarditis cases are due to  Mycobacterium tuberculosis .[30]

Pericarditis Theory
uremia or on dialysis
Two forms exist: uremic pericarditis and dialysis-associated pericarditis. Uremic pericarditis is reported
in 6% to 10% of patients with acute or chronic renal failure prior or shortly after institution of dialysis.
The likelihood of pericarditis increases with the severity of azotemia (BUN >60 mg/dL).[1]
Dialysis-associated pericarditis is reported in up to 13% of patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. It
is occasionally seen in patients on peritoneal dialysis who have not been adequately dialyzed. Most
patients respond to intensive dialysis within 1 to 2 weeks.
systemic autoimmune disorders
Pericarditis is commonly associated with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus but may not
be clinically apparent.[1]
Weak
pericardial injury
Occurs weeks to months post-event.
mediastinal radiation
Radiation therapy-associated acute exudative pericarditis is rare. Delayed acute pericarditis is more
common, and occurs weeks after radiation therapy. It is generally manifested as an asymptomatic
pericardial effusion or symptomatic pericarditis. Delayed chronic pericarditis may appear weeks to
years after radiation therapy and cause constrictive pericarditis.[31]
Etiology
Acute pericarditis can be idiopathic or due to an underlying systemic condition (e.g., systemic lupus
erythematosus). As many as 90% of cases are either idiopathic or due to viral infections (e.g., Coxsackie
virus A9 or B1-4, Echo 8, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella, rubella, HIV, Parvo-19,
SARS-CoV-2).[2] [3] [5] [14] [19] [20] Onset is frequently postviral, with no evidence of virus present in
the pericardium. Systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, reactive
arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, systemic vasculitides, inflammatory bowel disease) are also a common
cause.[21] [22] However, there are numerous other less common causes, including bacterial/fungal/parasitic
infections, secondary immune processes (e.g., rheumatic fever, postcardiotomy syndrome, post-myocardial
infarction [MI] syndrome), pericarditis and pericardial effusions in diseases of surrounding organs (e.g.,
acute MI, myocarditis, paraneoplastic syndromes), metabolic disorders (e.g., uremia, myxoedema), trauma,
neoplasms, and certain drugs. Rarely, pericarditis occurs after vaccination (including influenza and mRNA
COVID-19 vaccination).[23] [24] [25] [26] Fungal and drug causes are rare.
In developed countries, other causes include radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, percutaneous cardiac
interventions, and HIV.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  is a common cause in developing countries.[13]
[15] Pericarditis commonly occurs 1 to 3 days after an MI. It can also occur weeks or months after an MI
(Dressler syndrome).[14] Postcardiac injury syndrome is a broad term that describes pericarditis with or
without effusion that results from an MI or iatrogenic injury to the pericardium. It includes post-MI syndrome
(Dressler's), postcardiotomy syndrome, and post-traumatic pericarditis (due to percutaneous coronary
intervention or implantable electronic device placement, i.e., pacemaker or defibrillator).[18] [27]

Pericarditis Theory
THEORY
Pathophysiology
The pericardium consists of a two-layered pliable, fibroserous sac that covers the surface of the heart.
The inner layer, the visceral pericardium, is adherent to the myocardium. It has a microvillous surface that
secretes pericardial fluid. The outer layer, or parietal pericardium, is contiguous with the inner layer. It is
composed of collagen layers with interspersed elastin fibrils. Both layers are normally only 1 to 2 mm thick
and a space containing 15 to 35 mL of pericardial fluid separates them. The pericardium is perfused by the
internal mammary arteries and innervated by the phrenic nerve. The pericardium protects and restrains the
heart. In addition, it determines cardiac filling patterns, limits chamber dilatation, and equilibrates compliance
between the two ventricles.
Signs and symptoms of acute pericarditis result from inflammation of the pericardial tissue. The pericardium
is well innervated and inflammation causes severe pain. Pericarditis can be either fibrinous (dry) or effusive
with a purulent, serous, or hemorrhagic exudate. The formation of a concomitant effusion is usually due to a
response to the inflammation. The normal pericardium is permeable to water and electrolytes and pericardial
fluid is in dynamic equilibrium with the blood serum. Inflamed pericardial tissue impairs this equilibrium. Local
production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukins can cause
weeping of fluid from the visceral pericardium, as well as exudation of larger molecules that attract additional
fluid and impair resorption.[13] [14] [28] Constrictive pericarditis impedes normal diastolic filling and can be a
medium to late complication of acute pericarditis.

Case history
Case history #1
An otherwise healthy 30-year-old man presents with a several-day history of progressive, severe,
retrosternal chest pain that is sharp and pleuritic in nature. The pain is worse on lying down and improved
with sitting forward. There is radiation to the neck and shoulders and specifically to the trapezius muscle
ridges. The pain is constant and unrelated to exertion. On physical exam, a pericardial friction rub is heard
at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward.[12] [13]
Other presentations
A monophasic, biphasic, or triphasic pericardial friction rub is pathognomonic of acute pericarditis with
virtually 100% specificity. The rub can come and go over hours so the sensitivity is based upon the
frequency of cardiac auscultation, and it is important to examine patients with suspected pericarditis
repeatedly.[14] In a significant pericardial effusion, there can be signs of cardiac tamponade such as
tachycardia, tachypnea, pulsus paradoxus, and Beck triad (hypotension, jugular venous distention,
and distant heart sounds).[15] The presence of high, spiking fevers indicates an infectious etiology. A
prodrome of myalgias and malaise may be reported, particularly in young adults.[15]

Pericarditis Diagnosis
Recommendations
Key Recommendations
Acute pericarditis is a clinical diagnosis. Aspects of the clinical history and presentation, physical exam,
and ECG need to be combined in order to make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed in the
presence of at least 2 of the 4 clinical criteria:[16] [20] [36] [37] [38]
• Typical chest pain
• Pericardial friction rub
• Widespread ST elevation
• Pericardial effusion.
Because the most common causes of acute pericarditis usually follow a benign course, it is not essential
to determine the etiology in all patients, particularly in regions where tuberculosis has a low prevalence.[1]
In addition, there is a relatively low yield of diagnostic investigations. However, patients should be
screened for high-risk features, and attempts to determine etiology are recommended so that specific
causes associated with increased risk of complications can be identified.[1]
History
The key finding on history is constant, pleuritic central chest pain that is worse in the recumbent position
and radiates to one or both trapezius ridges (phrenic nerves both innervate the pericardium and trapezius
ridges).
• The pain is sharp, stabbing, pleuritic, or aching, and can mimic the pain of myocardial ischemia or
infarction, particularly when dull or pressure-like.
• Trapezius ridge pain is more specific for pericardial pain. Almost all patients report relief of pain
with sitting up or leaning forward.[39]
• The pain is generally constant, not related to exertion, and poorly responsive to nitrates.[13] [15]
The presence of associated high or spiking fever suggests an infectious cause.
Key risk factors include:[2] [3]
• Male sex
• Age 20 to 50 years
• Transmural myocardial infarction (MI)
• Cardiac surgery
• Neoplasm
• Viral and bacterial infection (e.g., Coxsackie virus A9 or B1-4, Echo 8, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, varicella, rubella, HIV, Parvo-19, SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis)
• Uremia
• Dialysis treatment
• Systemic autoimmune disorders.
A history of other underlying causes may also be present including radiation therapy, cardiac surgery,
percutaneous cardiac interventions, and neoplasms.
Bacterial pericarditis is a relatively rare entity in the antibiotic era. It is characterized by an acute illness
with high fever, tachycardia, and cough. Pleuritic or nonpleuritic chest pain is present in a minority

Pericarditis Diagnosis
DIAGNOSIS
of patients. Patients with postoperative bacterial pericarditis have signs of sternal wound infection or
mediastinitis. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.
Physical exam
The presence of a pericardial friction rub on physical exam is a key finding that supports the
diagnosis.[39] It is heard best at the left lower sternal border and at the cardiac borders. The presence of
a rub is 100% specific, but it is often absent at initial presentation (rub may be present in less than 33% of
cases).[1] The rub can come and go over hours, so the sensitivity is based upon the frequency of cardiac
auscultation and it is important to examine patients with suspected pericarditis repeatedly.[14]
Constrictive pericarditis should be suspected in a patient with unexplained right heart failure in whom
there is a history of pericardial disease or predisposing pericardial injury even if the pericardial insult
predates the clinical presentation by years.[40] Symptoms and signs of right-sided heart failure include
fatigue, ankle edema, and, in severe cases, ascites.
Initial workup
Although diagnosis is essentially clinical, some tests are indicated.[3] [13] [15] [38]
ECG
An ECG is very important in the initial round of tests for all patients. Typical ECG changes have been
reported to occur in up to 60% of cases.[1] The classic ECG changes are global upwardly concave ST-
segment (J-point) elevations with PR segment depressions in most leads with J-point depression and PR
elevation in leads aVR and V1. If the patient is seen soon after symptom onset, PR depressions may be
noted prior to ST elevation. The ECG may evolve over 4 phases: stage 1 consists of ST elevation and
upright T-waves that may resolve to normal (stage 2) over a period of several days or evolves further to T-
wave inversion (stage 3) and then to normal (stage 4).

Pericarditis Diagnosis
• CBC: blood count does not provide definitive insight into the cause or management strategy.
Leukocytosis with a marked shift to the left may be seen with purulent pericarditis or other
infectious etiology.[15] Indicated before commencing colchicine therapy, which may cause
neutropenia and bone marrow suppression.
• BUN: elevated levels of BUN (particularly >60 mg/dL) suggest a uremic cause.[15]
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): elevated ESR is consistent with an inflammatory state.[15]
• C-reactive protein: elevated C-reactive protein is common and consistent with an inflammatory
state; serial measurement may be helpful for monitoring the activity of the disease and efficacy of
therapy.[1] [15]
• Initial and serial serum troponins: elevated levels may be present and may reflect myocardial
involvement (e.g., myopericarditis), but the test is not specific or sensitive.[12] [15] Plasma
troponins are elevated in 35% to 50% of patients with pericarditis. The magnitude of elevation
correlates with the extent of ST-segment elevation and can be in the range considered diagnostic
of acute MI in some patients. Levels return to normal within 1 to 2 weeks of diagnosis (often within
days). Elevated levels do not appear to confer prognostic significance.
Other investigations
Although rare, purulent pericarditis is immediately life-threatening and requires immediate confirmation
of diagnosis via urgent pericardiocentesis. Pericardial fluid should be tested for bacterial, fungal, and
tuberculous causes, and blood should be drawn for culture.
A chest x-ray is ordered in all patients but is often normal unless there is an associated large pericardial
effusion, in which a water bottle-shaped enlarged cardiac silhouette is seen. The chest x-ray may also
demonstrate concomitant lung pathology providing evidence of tuberculosis, fungal disease, pneumonia,
or a neoplasm that may be related to the disease.
Follow-up tests
Other imaging modalities have limited usefulness in uncomplicated acute pericarditis, but are important
in assessing complications.[13] [15] Echocardiography is indicated especially when cardiac tamponade
is suspected. It can also help differentiate pericarditis from acute coronary syndromes; global ST
elevations in the absence of left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormalities and a trivial pericardial effusion
support the diagnosis of acute pericarditis. Echocardiography is insensitive to pericardial inflammation
in dry pericarditis but is important in detecting pericardial effusions. Chest computed tomography and
increasingly, magnetic resonance imaging, may be used to help diagnose constrictive pericarditis or
pericardial effusion.[18] [42]
If tuberculous pericarditis is suspected, diagnostic accuracy can be improved with identification of the
organism from pericardial fluid or pericardial biopsy.[43] [44] [45] Adenosine deaminase activity within the
pericardial effusion may also aid in the diagnosis as an adjunctive marker.[46]

History and exam
Key diagnostic factors
chest pain (common)
This is the most common symptom and occurs in more than 85% of cases.[1] Pain is sharp, stabbing,
pleuritic, or aching, and can mimic the pain of myocardial ischemia or infarction, particularly when dull
or pressure-like. Trapezius ridge pain is more specific for pericardial pain. Almost all patients report
relief of pain with sitting up or leaning forward. The pain is generally constant, not related to exertion,
and poorly responsive to nitrates.[13] [15]
pericardial rub (common)
May be present in <33% of cases.[1] The rub, when present, is described as high-pitched or squeaky.
It is heard best at the left sternal edge with the patient leaning forward at end-expiration.[12] The rub
can come and go over hours, so the sensitivity is based upon the frequency of cardiac auscultation
and it is important to examine patients with suspected pericarditis repeatedly.[14]

myalgias (uncommon)
A prodrome of myalgias and malaise may be present with any cause of acute pericarditis, particularly
in young adults.
signs of right-sided heart failure (uncommon)
Symptoms and signs of right-sided heart failure include fatigue, ankle edema, and, in severe cases,
ascites.
Constrictive pericarditis should be suspected in a patient with unexplained right heart failure in whom
there is a history of pericardial disease or predisposing pericardial injury even if the pericardial insult
predates the clinical presentation by years.[40]

ECG
This is the most useful diagnostic test and should be ordered in all
patients.
The classic ECG changes are global upwardly concave ST-segment
(J-point) elevations with PR segment depressions in most leads with
J-point depression and PR elevation in leads aVR and V1. If the
patient is seen soon after symptom onset, PR depressions may be
noted prior to ST elevation.
ECG changes occur in 60% of patients.[1] Temporal evolution of the
ECG changes is highly variable.

pericarditis.
The magnitude of elevation correlates with extent of ST-segment
elevation.
Levels can be in the range considered diagnostic of acute myocardial

chest CT or cardiac MRI
When the clinical presentation suggests other than uncomplicated
pericarditis or the presentation is atypical, additional imaging with CT
or MRI may be useful.[18] [42] [47]
May detect complications such as pericardial effusion or constrictive
pericarditis, especially when the echocardiographic findings are
inconclusive. Additional diagnostic information may also be obtained
when there is associated chest trauma, particularly when penetrating;
or in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, carcinoma, pulmonary
or thoracic infection, or pancreatitis.
In cases of suspected constrictive pericarditis, CT and MRI provide
accurate measurements of pericardial thickness and extent of
pericardial thickening, which can be helpful for preoperative planning
prior to pericardiectomy.[42]

Differentiating tests
Pulmonary embolism (PE) • Chest pain can be anterior,
posterior, or lateral in
location. It is in phase
with respiration (no chest
pain when the patient
ceases breathing) and is not
positional in nature.
• Pericardial friction rub is
rarely present.
• A pleural friction rub can
be detected in 3% of
patients.[12] [28] [48]
• If a patient has concomitant
pericarditis and PE, a
risk for tamponade exists
when using anticoagulation
due to bleeding in the
pericardial space.[49]
Monitoring for worsening
effusion is recommended,
with consideration of risk/
benefit for those who are
anticoagulated.
• Computed tomographic
pulmonary angiography will
show direct visualization of
thrombus in a pulmonary
artery.
• Elevation of D-dimer (this
may also be raised in
pericarditis).[50]
• ECG may show evidence of
right ventricular dysfunction;
however, ECG cannot
definitively establish
or eliminate PE as a
diagnosis.[51] [52] [53]
Myocardial infarction or
ischemia
• Chest pain is described
as pressure-like, heavy,
squeezing, and responsive
to nitroglycerin. There is
generally no variation with
respiration or positional
changes. Duration of pain is
minutes to hours, rather than
hours to days. Pericardial
friction rub is generally
absent (unless there is
associated pericarditis).[12]
[28] [48]
• ECG may show convex ST
elevations in the distribution
of coronary arteries; Q-
waves may be present; PR
segment depression is rare;
inverted T-waves when ST
segments are still elevated.
Significant elevation
of serum troponin and
cardiac enzymes present if
myocardial damage.
• Coronary angiogram
(invasive or CT) shows
presence of thrombus with
occlusion of the artery.
Pneumonia • Associated with cough and
fever. Note that the presence
of pneumonia may also be
related to the presence of
concomitant pericarditis.
• Chest x-ray may show
evidence of infiltrates.
• The absence of concomitant
ECG findings supporting
pericarditis excludes
significant pericardial
involvement.
Pneumothorax • Many of the signs and
symptoms may overlap
including sudden onset
shortness of breath,
• Chest x-ray confirms lung
collapse.

include chest pain (which
may be pleuritic as a result
of concomitant pericarditis),
palpitations, fatigue, or
signs of heart failure (e.g.,
peripheral edema, increasing

common.
Criteria
Clinical classification[1]
Pericarditis can be classified by duration of inflammation as well as by etiology and complications/sequelae.
A. Acute pericarditis (new onset, <4-6 weeks)
• Inflammatory pericardial syndrome associated with at least 2 of the following 4 criteria:
• Pericarditic chest pain
• Pericardial friction rubs
• New diffuse electrocardiographic ST-elevations or PR depressions
• New or worsening pericardial effusion.
• Additional supporting findings include:
• Elevated inflammatory markers (i.e., CRP, ESR, WBC count)

Pericarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Recommendations
Key Recommendations
Treatment is directed at any identified underlying disorder with supportive management directed at relief
of symptoms. Hospitalization is generally recommended to determine etiology where possible, observe for
complications such as cardiac tamponade, and gauge response to therapy.
Initial management of patients with suspected pericarditis
Any patient with a clinical presentation that suggests an underlying etiology should be admitted to hospital
for further investigation and treatment.[1]
Patients with at least one predictor of poor prognosis (major or minor risk factors below) should also be
admitted.[1]
Major risk factors:
• High fever (i.e., >100.4°F [>38°C])
• Subacute course (i.e., symptoms over several days without a clear-cut acute onset)
• Evidence of a large pericardial effusion (i.e., diastolic echo-free space >20 mm)
• Cardiac tamponade
• Failure to respond within 7 days to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
Minor risk factors:
• Pericarditis associated with myocarditis (myopericarditis)
• Immunosuppression
• Trauma
• Oral anticoagulant therapy.
Patients with any of these risk factors warrant careful observation and follow-up. Some patients without
any of these features can be managed as an outpatient if considered appropriate. In these cases, the
patient should be started on treatment (i.e., empiric anti-inflammatories) with follow-up after 1 week to
assess the response to treatment.[1]
Pericardial effusion
If a pericardial effusion is present, pericardiocentesis is indicated for clinical tamponade, for high
suspicion of purulent or neoplastic pericarditis, or if the effusion is large or symptomatic.[1] In the absence
of these indications, medical therapy is started as dictated by the cause.
Purulent disease
Purulent pericarditis is immediately life-threatening and requires immediate confirmation of diagnosis via
urgent pericardiocentesis. Pericardial fluid should be tested for bacterial, fungal, and tuberculous causes,
and blood should be drawn for culture.[1]
If purulent pericarditis is suspected, urgent percutaneous pericardiocentesis with rinsing of the pericardial
cavity and intravenous antibiotics are mandatory. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy is recommended
until microbiologic results are available.[1] There are limited data available to guide antibiotic selection,

Pericarditis Management
but experts typically recommend a regimen that contains an antistaphylococcal antibiotic. The choice
of antibiotics will depend on various factors including local resistance patterns and MRSA prevalence.
Follow your local protocols and seek microbiology or infectious disease advice. Empiric therapy should be
switched to tailored therapy depending on the underlying pathogens identified from pericardial fluid and
blood cultures.[1]
Therapy with systemic antibiotics should be continued until fever and clinical signs of infection, including
leukocytosis, have resolved.[3]
An NSAID should also be started on diagnosis for symptom management with a proton-pump inhibitor
to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects; the dose should be tapered after 1-2 weeks according to
symptoms.[1] [14] Acetaminophen or an opioid can be considered if NSAIDs are not effective or are
contraindicated. Colchicine should only be used with caution in patients with purulent pericarditis as it
may interfere with leukocyte function and infection clearance.[54]
Open surgical drainage via a subxiphoid pericardiotomy is also required.[1] Pericardiectomy in these
patients is necessary in the presence of dense adhesions or loculations, persistent bacteremia, recurrent
tamponade, or progression to constrictive physiology.[1] [37]

Pericarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Exercise should be restricted until chest pain resolves and inflammatory markers have normalized.[55]
 A minimum of 3 months is often considered appropriate (and recommended for patients involved in
competitive sports), but shorter periods of exercise restriction may be considered depending on patient
and disease characteristics (e.g., nonathletes and/or mild clinical picture).[1] [14] [37] [56]
Nonpurulent disease: first presentation
NSAIDs are given for symptom relief.[16] [20] [37] [57] They reduce fever, chest pain, and inflammation
but do not prevent tamponade, constriction, or recurrent pericarditis.[37] [38] NSAIDs are given with
a proton-pump inhibitor to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects (e.g., ulcer formation);
consider tapering the dose after 1-2 weeks according to symptoms.[1] [14] Ibuprofen is frequently used
because of its favorable side-effect profile compared with other drugs in this class; however, choice of
drug should be based on patient characteristics (e.g., contraindications, previous efficacy, or adverse
effects) and physician expertise.[1] [18] Aspirin is preferred if required for persistent symptoms due to
early pericarditis or late pericarditis post-myocardial infarction (MI) as other NSAIDs adversely affect
myocardial healing, and for its antiplatelet activity. Glucocorticoids and NSAIDs (other than aspirin) are
not indicated for post-MI pericarditis due to the potential for harm.[58] If NSAIDs or high-dose aspirin are
not effective or are contraindicated, acetaminophen or an opioid may be considered.
Colchicine is recommended as a first-line adjunct therapy to NSAIDs as it improves response, decreases
recurrences, and increases remission rates.[1] [59] It is given for 3 months in this setting.[1] [20] [57] [60]
The addition of colchicine should be considered in patients with postcardiotomy injury syndromes (e.g.,
Dressler syndrome, which generally occurs 1-2 weeks after an MI; or postcardiac surgery), provided
there are no contraindications and it is well tolerated. Preventive administration is recommended for 1
month. Careful follow-up with echocardiography every 6 to 12 months according to clinical features and
symptoms should be considered to exclude possible evolution towards constrictive pericarditis.[1]
In cases of idiopathic or postviral pericarditis, if chest pain has not resolved after 2 weeks, a corticosteroid
can be considered as an option in patients who do not respond to anti-inflammatory therapy, or
for patients in whom an NSAID is contraindicated, once an infectious cause has been excluded.
Corticosteroids are not recommended in patients with viral pericarditis because of the risk of re-activation
of the viral infection and ongoing inflammation. Corticosteroids may also be used when there is a specific
indication for their use (e.g., the presence of an autoimmune disease). They are used in combination
with colchicine for this indication. Corticosteroids are less favored compared with NSAIDs because of the
risks of promoting chronic and/or recurrent disease, and side effects.[1] If used, low to moderate doses
are preferred over high doses.[18] The initial dose should be maintained until symptoms have resolved
and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level has normalized. Once this is achieved, the dose may be gradually
tapered.[1]
In addition to the above treatment, the underlying cause should also be treated if known. Underlying
causes include viral infections (e.g., Coxsackie virus A9, B1-4, Echo 8, mumps, Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, varicella, rubella, HIV, Parvo-19, SARS-CoV-2), tuberculosis (a common cause in
the developing world), secondary immune processes (e.g., rheumatic fever, postcardiotomy syndrome,
post-MI syndrome), metabolic disorders (e.g., uremia, myxedema), radiation therapy, cardiac surgery,
percutaneous cardiac interventions, systemic autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
sclerosis, reactive arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, systemic vasculitides, inflammatory bowel
disease), bacterial/fungal/parasitic infections, trauma, certain drugs, and neoplasms.

Pericarditis Management
In patients with tuberculous pericarditis, first-line treatment is 4 to 6 weeks of antituberculous therapy.[1]
[3] [16] [37] [61] When tuberculous pericarditis is confirmed in an nonendemic area, a suitable 6-month
regimen is effective; empiric therapy is not required in the absence of an established diagnosis in
nonendemic areas.[1] Adjunctive therapies such as colchicine, corticosteroids, and immunotherapy
have not been shown to be beneficial.[62] [63] [64] [65] However, corticosteroids may be considered in
patients with tuberculous pericarditis who are HIV-negative.[66]  Pericardiectomy is recommended if the
patient does not improve or is deteriorating after 4 to 8 weeks of antituberculosis therapy.[1] [67] Most
patients with uremic pericarditis respond to intensive dialysis within 1 to 2 weeks. Autoimmune disorders
are treated with corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive therapies depending on the specific
condition. Treatment of neoplasms may involve any combination of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or
surgery, depending on the type of tumor identified.[37] [38] Patients with viral pericarditis may benefit from
specific antiviral therapy; however, an infectious disease attending should be involved.
Exercise should be restricted until chest pain resolves and inflammatory markers have normalized.[55]
 A minimum of 3 months is often considered appropriate (and is recommended for those participating in
competitive sports), but shorter periods of exercise restriction may be considered depending on patient
and disease characteristics (e.g., nonathletes and/or mild clinical picture).[1] [14] [37] [56]
Nonpurulent disease: recurrent
For recurrent pericarditis, patients are treated with an NSAID plus colchicine, as well as exercise
restriction. The NSAID should be continued until symptoms resolve, and the colchicine continued for 6
months to prevent recurrence. A longer duration of therapy for colchicine can be considered in resistant
cases. CRP levels should be used to guide therapy and response. Once the CRP has normalized, drug
therapy can be tapered gradually according to symptoms and the CRP level.[1]
For patients who do not respond to an NSAID plus colchicine, corticosteroid therapy can be considered as
for patients at the initial presentation. Third-line therapies in recurrent disease are immunosuppressants,
including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, and rilonacept), and
azathioprine.[68] All are off-label for pericarditis, except for rilonacept which is approved for recurrent
pericarditis (but not first presentations).[18] [42] These therapies should be used in consultation with a
rheumatologist.[1] [20] [57] [69] [70] [71] [72] Further studies are needed.
For patients with persistent, symptomatic recurrence refractory to all medical treatment, pericardiotomy is
recommended.[1] In tuberculous pericarditis, patients in whom there are recurrent effusions or evidence
of constrictive physiology despite medical therapy, are treated surgically with pericardiectomy.[3] It is
particularly recommended if the patient’s condition is not improving or is deteriorating after 4 to 8 weeks of
antituberculosis therapy. Standard antituberculosis drugs for 6 months is recommended for the prevention
of tuberculous pericardial constriction.[1]

to standard therapies, where constriction is present (e.g., following cardiac surgery or radiation therapy, or
idiopathic constrictive pericarditis).[42] [73]

» Any patient with a clinical presentation that
suggests an underlying etiology should be
admitted to hospital for further investigation and
treatment.[1]
» Patients with at least one predictor of poor
prognosis (major or minor risk factors below)
should also be admitted.[1] Patients with any of
these risk factors warrant careful observation
and follow-up.
» Major risk factors include: high fever (i.e.,
>100.4°F [>38°C]); subacute course (i.e.,
symptoms over several days without a clear-
cut acute onset); evidence of a large pericardial
effusion (i.e., diastolic echo-free space >20 mm);
cardiac tamponade; failure to respond within 7
days to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID).
» Minor risk factors include: pericarditis
associated with myocarditis (myopericarditis);
immunosuppression; trauma; oral anticoagulant
therapy. Patients with any of these risk factors
warrant careful observation and follow-up.
» Some patients without any of these features
can be managed as an outpatient if considered
appropriate. In these cases, the patient should
be started on treatment (i.e., empiric anti-
inflammatories) with follow-up after 1 week to
assess the response to treatment.[1]
consider pericardiocentesis
Treatment recommended for SOME patients in
selected patient group
» Pericardiocentesis is indicated for clinical
tamponade, for high suspicion of purulent
or neoplastic pericarditis, or for large or
symptomatic effusions.[1] [37] [38]

Pericarditis Management
MANAGEMENT
Acute
purulent
1st pericardiocentesis + intravenous
antibiotics
» Purulent pericarditis is immediately life-
threatening and requires immediate confirmation
of diagnosis via urgent pericardiocentesis.
Pericardial fluid should be tested for bacterial,
fungal, and tuberculous causes, and blood
should be drawn for culture.[1]
» Urgent rinsing of the pericardial cavity and
intravenous antibiotics are mandatory.[37] [38]
» Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy is
recommended until microbiologic results are
available. There are limited data available to
guide selection of the best empiric regimen,
but experts typically recommend a regimen
that contains an antistaphylococcal antibiotic.
The choice of antibiotics will depend on various
factors including local resistance patterns
and MRSA prevalence. Follow your local
protocols for choice of antibiotics and seek
microbiology or infectious disease advice.
Empiric therapy should be switched to tailored
therapy depending on the underlying pathogens
identified from pericardial fluid and blood
cultures.[1]
» Therapy with systemic antibiotics should
be continued until fever and clinical signs of
infection, including leukocytosis, have resolved.
plus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) or alternative analgesia

» codeine sulfate: 15-60 mg orally every 4-6
hours when required, maximum 360 mg/day
» An NSAID should be started immediately
on diagnosis for symptom management.[16]
[20] [37] [57] Consider tapering the dose after
1-2 weeks according to symptoms.[1] NSAIDs
reduce fever, chest pain, and inflammation
but do not prevent tamponade, constriction, or
recurrent pericarditis.[37] [38]
» Choice of drug is based on patient
characteristics (e.g., contraindications, previous
efficacy, or side effects), the presence of
concomitant diseases (e.g., aspirin is favored
over other NSAIDs if antiplatelet therapy is
required), and physician expertise.[1]
» Alternatively, acetaminophen or an opioid (e.g.,
codeine) can be considered if NSAIDs are not
effective or are contraindicated.
plus exercise restriction
Treatment recommended for ALL patients in
selected patient group
» Exercise should be restricted until chest
pain resolves and inflammatory markers have
normalized.[55] A minimum of 3 months is often
considered appropriate (and recommended
for patients involved in competitive sports), but
shorter periods of exercise restriction may be
considered depending on patient and disease
characteristics (e.g., nonathletes and/or mild
clinical picture).[1] [14] [37] [56]

Primary options
» esomeprazole: 20-40 mg orally once daily
OR
» lansoprazole: 15-30 mg orally once daily
» Due to the high doses of NSAIDs used, a
proton-pump inhibitor (e.g., esomeprazole,
lansoprazole) is given alongside NSAID therapy
(if used) to protect against gastrointestinal ulcer
formation.[12] [14] [37] [38]

leukocyte function and infection clearance.[54]
» It is given for 3 months in the setting of acute
pericarditis.[1] [20] [57] [60]
» While tapering the dose is not mandatory,
it can be considered in the last few weeks of
treatment to prevent persistence of symptoms
and recurrence.[1]
» Before commencing treatment, a baseline
complete blood count (CBC) is indicated
as colchicine may cause neutropenia and

exercised in renal and hepatic impairment as
its use may be contraindicated in patients on
certain medications.
2nd pericardiotomy/pericardiectomy
» Open surgical drainage via a subxiphoid
pericardiotomy should be considered.[1]
» Pericardiectomy is necessary in the presence
of dense adhesions or loculations, persistent
bacteremia, recurrent tamponade, or progression
to constrictive physiology.[1] [37]

» A corticosteroid can be considered in patients
who do not respond to anti-inflammatory therapy
or in whom an NSAID is contraindicated,
once an infectious cause has been excluded.
Corticosteroids are not recommended in patients
with viral pericarditis because of the risk of

inflammation. Corticosteroids may also be used
when there is a specific indication for their use
(e.g., presence of an autoimmune disease).[1]

(e.g., Coxsackie virus A9, B1-4, Echo 8,
mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,
varicella, rubella, HIV, Parvo-19, SARS-CoV-2),

(e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis,
reactive arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever,
systemic vasculitides, inflammatory bowel
disease), bacterial/fungal/parasitic infections,
trauma, certain drugs, and neoplasms. Patients
with viral pericarditis may benefit from specific
antiviral therapy; however, an infectious disease
attending should be involved.
» In patients with tuberculous pericarditis, first-
line treatment is 4 to 6 weeks of antituberculous
therapy.[1] When tuberculous pericarditis is
confirmed in a nonendemic area, a suitable 6-
month regimen is effective; empiric therapy is
not required in the absence of an established
diagnosis in nonendemic areas.[1] Adjunctive
therapies such as colchicine, corticosteroids,
and immunotherapy have not been shown
to be beneficial.[62] [63] [64] [65] However,
corticosteroids may be considered in patients
with tuberculous pericarditis who are HIV-
negative.[66]  Pericardiectomy is recommended
if the patient does not improve or is deteriorating
after 4 to 8 weeks of antituberculosis therapy.[1]

for persistent symptoms due to early pericarditis
or late pericarditis post-MI as other NSAIDs
adversely affect myocardial healing, and for its
antiplatelet activity. Glucocorticoids and NSAIDs
(other than aspirin) are not indicated for post-MI

Emerging
Intrapericardial fibrinolysis
This treatment is being investigated as an adjunct therapy for patients with infective pericarditis (i.e.,
tuberculous and purulent) where there is a high risk of constrictive pericarditis. Case reports and small trials
have shown promising results; however, these results need to be replicated on a larger basis before this
therapy is recommended.
Primary prevention
Colchicine may be of benefit for primary prevention of pericarditis and pericardial effusions in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery.[32] [33] [34] [35]
Secondary prevention
Colchicine may be of benefit for secondary prevention of pericarditis.[32] [34] [78] [Evidence B]
Patient discussions
It is advised that vigorous exercise should not be performed until after the chest pain resolves and
inflammatory markers have normalized.[1] [14] [37] A minimum of 3 months exercise restriction is often
considered appropriate (and recommended for patients involved in competitive sports), but shorter
periods may be considered depending on patient and disease characteristics (e.g., nonathletes and/or
mild clinical picture).[1] [14] [37] [56] Constrictive pericarditis excludes patients from all competitive sports.

Pericarditis Follow up
Monitoring
Monitoring
Patients who do not have risk factors for poor prognosis (i.e., high fever; subacute course; evidence
of a large pericardial effusion; cardiac tamponade; failure to respond within 7 days to a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug; myopericarditis; immunosuppression; trauma; oral anticoagulant therapy) can
be managed as outpatients with empiric anti-inflammatories and evaluated in the clinic after 1 week to
assess the response to treatment.[1]
Generally, long-term surveillance is not necessary in patients with acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis.
Repeat imaging (echo, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) may be required in
patients who have associated pericardial effusions or suspicion of constrictive pericarditis.[13] [37]
Complications
Complications Timeframe Likelihood
pericardial effusion with or without cardiac
tamponade
short term medium
Accumulation of transudate, exudate, or blood in the pericardial sac can occur due to pericardial
inflammation. Increased intrapericardial pressure from the pericardial effusion (particularly one in which
the fluid accumulation occurs over a relatively short time) can compress the cardiac chambers leading to
cardiac tamponade.[1] [14] [48]
Pericardiocentesis is indicated for hemodynamic compromise, purulent pericarditis, and a high suspicion
of tumor. The effusion should be drained dry and the fluid analyzed for glucose, protein, and lactic
dehydrogenase. Cell count, microscopy, bacterial and/or viral culture, and cytologic exam should be
performed.
In some situations, pericardiocentesis cannot be performed from a percutaneous approach and surgical
drainage is required. A subxiphoid approach is generally successful and has <1% complication rate and
8% rate of recurrence of effusion.
Pericardial biopsy should be considered if malignant or granulomatous disease is suspected.
chronic constrictive pericarditis variable low
Most cases occur within 3 to 12 months after the pericardial insult. It is a relatively rare complication.[76]
In developed countries, it is most frequently caused by prior cardiac surgery (prevalence of 0.2% to 0.3%),
radiation therapy (4% of patients with radiation for mediastinal Hodgkin), and idiopathic pericarditis.
Tuberculosis is the main cause in developing countries.
In the healing process of acute, fibrinous, serofibrinous, or chronic pericardial effusion, the pericardial
cavity can be completely replaced by granulation tissue. This results in a dense scar that encases the
heart and interferes with ventricular filling. Surgical pericardial resection is the definitive treatment.[1] [2]

Pericarditis Follow up
FOLLOW UP
Prognosis
Prognosis generally depends on the underlying cause and disease severity. Features associated with a poor
prognosis include:[1] [14] [16] [36] [37] [38] [45]
• Major prognostic factors:
• Evidence of a large pericardial effusion (i.e., diastolic echo-free space >20 mm)
• High fever (i.e., >100.4°F [>38.8°C])
• Subacute course (i.e., symptoms over several days without a clear-cut acute onset)
• Failure to respond within 7 days to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
• Minor prognostic factors:
• Pericarditis associated with myocarditis (myopericarditis)
• Immunosuppression
• Trauma
• Oral anticoagulant therapy.
The presence of major prognostic factors warrants hospitalization and a full evaluation for etiology of the
pericardial disease.[1] [36]
Acute idiopathic pericarditis is generally a self-limited disease in 70% to 90% of patients, with no significant
complications or recurrence. Purulent pericarditis is uniformly fatal if untreated and has a mortality of 40%
with treatment.[74] Complications are frequent in bacterial and tuberculous forms of the disease (constriction
occurs in up to 30% to 50%). Uremic pericarditis generally responds to intensive dialysis. Effusions are
common with neoplastic pericarditis and are often recurrent and difficult to manage.[1] [2] [13]
15% to 30% of patients with pericarditis experience recurrence.[75]

What are the benefits and harms of colchicine for people with pericarditis?
This table is a summary of the analysis reported in a Cochrane Clinical Answer that focuses on the
above important clinical question.

Note
The Cochrane review which underpins this Cochrane Clinical Answer (CCA) notes that while colchicine is
effective in reducing the number of further recurrences in people with acute or recurrent pericarditis, data is
limited and may not be sufficient enough to recommend colchicine use in the general pericarditis population.
It also notes that people with multiple resistant recurrences are not represented in any of the assessed
studies.

# The CCA notes that while adverse events were infrequent (<10%) and there was no clear difference
between treatment groups, more people withdrew from treatment when taking colchicine than those who did
not receive colchicine.
* Evidence levels
The Evidence level is an internal rating applied by BMJ Best Practice. See the EBM Toolkit for details.
Confidence in evidence
A -  High or moderate to high
B -  Moderate or low to moderate
C -  Very low or low
† Effectiveness (BMJ rating)
Based on statistical significance, which demonstrates that the results are unlikely to be due to chance, but
which does not necessarily translate to a clinical significance.
‡ Grade certainty ratings
High The authors are very confident that the true
effect is similar to the estimated effect.
Moderate The authors are moderately confident that
the true effect is likely to be close to the
estimated effect.
Low The authors have limited confidence in the
effect estimate and the true effect may be
substantially different.
Very Low The authors have very little confidence in
the effect estimate and the true effect is
likely to be substantially different.
